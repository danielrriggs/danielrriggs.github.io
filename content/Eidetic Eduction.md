Eidetic eduction is an exaptation of phenomenologists Husserl and Merleau-Ponty's eidetic reductions, integrating it with Plato's forms or ideas (eidei) as conceived by "third wave" scholarship on Plato.

The root "duco" means leading, guiding, conducting.

The eidos means the look, the aspect of a being (latin "species"). It is the throughline through the multiple, indefinite, combinatorially explosive aspects of a being, the throughline which is not itself an aspect but which binds the aspects insofar as they are aspects of a same being, fitting together in an intelligible form.

For Dr. Vervaeke, the eidetic eduction is the process of drawing forth this throughline from each "intellected" being that we encounter. It is an inexhaustible process, as the being is always further revealing, showing its eidos in a different guise, through new aspects, and always veiling itself in itself so that our eye is drawn deeper into its form.
