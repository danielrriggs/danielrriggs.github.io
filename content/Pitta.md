One of the three [[Dosha|doshas]] in [[Ayurveda]], Fire and Water. Pitta's qualities are that it's driven; focused; it's angry; it's hot. Ambitious temperament. Can be conflict prone & argumentative. Have a strong digestive fire (good at digesting things), but prone to things like Ulcers when their digestive fire gets out of control. Medium body type.

###### Stress
Under stress, the Pitta mind gets ill-tempered, irritable, and argumentative. When aggravated, pick fights with people & can be conflict prone.

###### Working Temperament
Like [[Vata]]s, tend to start at a decent clip and can work for a while, and then also will eventually get tired.
