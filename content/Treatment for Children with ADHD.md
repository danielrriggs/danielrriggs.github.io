5% of kids have [[ADHD]], whereas only 2.5% of adults have [[ADHD]]. A lot of the studies focus on the pediatric population. Medication is no longer first-line treatment for children. Behavioral interventions, or therapy is actually just as good as medication. Therapy for a child usually means simple stuff like organization, reducing distractions, helping them develop tools to focus, and things like that.
- Routine can be very important. Parental involvement with developing routine is important.
Attention and habit circuits are different. If we can ingrain habits (do things on autopilot), attention never enters the picture.
- [[Organization|Organizational]] skills
- Minimize distractions. Create a low-distraction environment to enhance focus.
	- Our ability to attend to something is highly fluctuating. People with [[ADHD]] have lower distraction threshold.
- Prioritize goals - inattention and impulsivity can create lots of problems in life; only try to address a few of them at a time. Don't try to boil the ocean. We need small, constant progress (first, develop routine, then that can develop into bigger habits, etc.)
- Avoid reinforcing negative behaviors: Ensure consequences and rewards encourage desired behaviors.
- **Choose appropriate activities:** Select activities that children can successfully participate in to boost self-esteem and reduce difficulty.
	- 50 to 75 percent of children who have ADHD will grow into depression in adulthood. That is a staggering number. And part of the reason for that is because they have so much difficulty engaging in society.
- Non-punitive discipline: Implement a disciplinary system that shapes behavior without punishment.
- Limit choices: Provide fewer options to reduce overwhelm and facilitate decision-making.
- Clear and focused goals: Set specific, actionable targets to develop habits and routines.
- Medication: Consider as a second-line treatment for children with severe or persistent problems despite behavioral interventions.
