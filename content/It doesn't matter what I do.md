These thoughts can be absolutely devastating because they almost become self-fulfilling prophecies. Once we believe that we're incapable of success, it becomes really hard to find the [[motivation]] to even try. As we've learned from things like the [[Action Success Calculation]], a big part of our motivation actually comes from our confidence in the ability to succeed. Our mind doesn't bother generating energy towards actions that will be futile.

The [[Placebo Effect]] & [[Nocebo Effect]] are very powerful. They work even if we know we're casting belief in a placebo.

These thoughts come from the emotional seed of [[powerlessness]], or [[hopelessness]].

At some point, you probably felt some kind of emotion - "this isn't going to work for me". And then, as you make an attempt, that attempt becomes plagued with the [[Nocebo Effect]]. You fail and it reinforces this [[Samskara]]. Now you have evidence that you won't be successful. This cycle repeats itself; your failures follow you. Your motivation tanks.

###### What to do about this
- First, catch the thought when it happens. Notice that your mind will populate with these thoughts but that those thoughts aren't necessarily true. Don't give into it.
- We want to decrease the emotional energy through which it was formed. Because this [[Samskara]] is rooted in [[powerlessness]] or [[hopelessness]], the key question you need to ask yourself is, **when did you give up hope**?
	- Oftentimes, the seed of this hopelessness preceded even your first attempt.
- Then, you can start emotionally digesting it. You can start to reframe your perspective.
