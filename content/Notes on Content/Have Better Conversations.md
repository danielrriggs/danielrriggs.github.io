From Celeste Headlee's TED Talks _"10 ways to have a better conversation"._

1. **Don't multi-task.** Be present at that moment and don't think about other things when having a conversation.
2. **Don't pontificate.** Stating your opinions and not willing to listen makes you boring and predictable. Enter every conversation assuming you have something to learn. Everybody is an expert in something.
3. **Use open-ended questions.** Start your questions using who, what, where, when and how. If you put in complicated questions like "were you terrified?", people will respond with a simple yes or no. Try asking "What was that like?", "How did that feel?", this will get people to think about it and give more meaningful answers.
4. **Go with the flow.** Thoughts will come into your mind, and you need to let it go when conversing with people. If you suddenly get an idea of something you want to say, forget it and let it go. Because it will distract you, and you'll be too preoccupied to listen.
5. **If you don't know, say that you don't know.** Don't pretend. People will like to learn you something.
6. **Don't equate your experience** with theirs, such as losing a family member. All experiences are individual, don't use that opportunity to prove how amazing you are or how much you suffered. Don't make it about yourself. Conversations are not a promotional opportunity.
7. **Try not to repeat yourself.** It's condescending and boring. When you are making a point, don't rephrase over and over.
8. **Stay out of the weeds.** People don't care about details like the names and dates. People care about you, what you're like and what you have in common.
9. **Listen.** People can get distracted easily. Average person talks at 225 words per minutes, but can listen about 500 words per minutes. So our mind is filling in the rest 275 words. Put in energy and effort to listen.
10. **Be brief.** A good conversation is like a mini-skirt. Short enough to retain interest, but long enough to cover the subject.
11. **Be prepared to be amazed.** You can find something amazing in anyone if you listen well and stay open-minded.
