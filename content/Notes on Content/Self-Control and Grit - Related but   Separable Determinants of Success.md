Important determinants in success:
[[Grit]] and [[Self-Control]]. Self-control and grit are strongly correlated, but not perfectly. They are related, but distinct. Self-controlled people can handle temptations but may not be consistently pursuing a dominant goal & some high achievers may succumb to temptations in other domains.

Self-control is more tightly coupled with everyday success whereas Grit is more tightly coupled with exceptional achievements (over long periods of time).

Do individuals who exemplify grit but not self control have stronger approach-motivation systems, and do individuals who exemplify self-control but not grit have stronger avoidance systems?

Very generally, we assume that commitment to a superordinate goal is a function of that goalâ€™s feasibility and desirability, and thus that the diverse psychological antecedents to such valuations (e.g., growth mindset, optimism, attribution style, locus of control, counterfactual style, core self-evaluation, intrinsic motivation, interest, approaches to happiness) are logical targets for intervention and inquiry.
