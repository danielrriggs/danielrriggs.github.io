- Recognize how you're using it.
- Think about the other things you'd rather be doing.
- Rethink what you're addicted to as unappealing.
- Find something to get so focused on that you forget about your addiction and you end up resetting your dopamine levels.
- Recognize that watching YouTube may not be doing for you what you think it is (for example: it isn't restful).
- Self-image - meditate on who you want to be as a person.
	- Without this addiction, I am way more fruitful, productive, ambitious, confident, resilient. YouTube isn't necessary for your personal growth.
