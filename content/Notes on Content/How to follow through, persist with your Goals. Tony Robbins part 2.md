[(1) How to follow through / persist with your Goals? - Tony Robbins [part 2] - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HM7q9p_4vMA)

Raise your standards. Make your shoulds, musts. Resolve to change. You'll get energy from your identity.

Wants don't get met consistently, needs / musts do. It isn't about changing your identity, it's about expanding it.
