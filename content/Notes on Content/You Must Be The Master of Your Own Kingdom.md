[Guy Ritchie "You Must Be The Master of Your Own Kingdom" - The Joe Rogan Experience - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd3yeX1-SaM)

- Take ownership of your life.

"if you don't own something, you're not the boss. You have to take full responsibility for everything that you do. Why be subservient? You must be the master of your own Kingdom."

Prodigal son story - you have to leave yourself to understand yourself (prostitute yourself before you realize your own value).

King Arthur story - every man is an aristocrat & must take his own authority / divinity / identity back from the world (that is, your own power - you're no longer looking for a sense of yourself outside of yourself). By facing the demons you have created (wrestling match in the face of who you are - by taking away your crutches).

"Religion has done to the spiritual significance of narrative what the businessman did to the suit. He's literalized it. He's doing it for others (for convention), not realizing that wearing a suit is something spectacular. He isn't doing it for himself."
He isn't owning the suit. He's been robed.
By literalizing narrative (by seeing only a narrative's exterior aspects), we see the world upside down & aren't interested in the essence of the narrative (that is, interested in the narrative's body as opposed to its soul) (because we're too preoccupied with ... something else).
