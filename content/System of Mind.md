Why do some people get excited about studying instead of video games? How can we populate our [[Mind]] with helpful thoughts (which leads to helpful action, ultimately shaping our life)?

Where do thoughts come from? Two places - from the inside, and from the outside:

###### Thoughts from the outside - [[Indriya|Indriya]]s
From the outside, thoughts come from the [[Indriya]]s
Depending on how we populate our [[Mind]] from our [[Indriya]]s, certain thoughts can dominate our mind.
- *Example: getting really excited in anticipation of a movie / game / album / show that's coming out. Once upon a time, before the thing even existed, this thought wasn't present in your mind. You can't think about something until you know that it exists, which starts with an [[Indriya]]. Then you bombard your [[Indriya]] with stimulus from the {game}, hang out with friends who play the {game}, etc... Then eventually, you get bored of the {game}, stop playing it, ... out of sight, out of mind.*

The principle that the sense organs lead to thoughts in the [[Mind]] obviously isn't new.

In Victorian England, table cloths were developed to keep men from thinking lustful thoughts. Even the sight of a bare table leg could create lustful thoughts, so they covered it up. They basically "created a wall" between the inside & the outside by blocking their sense organs. 

Controlling our environment to control your thoughts can be useful (like cutting a toxic person out of your life), but as the environment enters the [[Mind]] it can also be controlled there, too.

In Victorian England, people "built a wall", but the yogis "built a window". Instead of asking people to dress a certain way to control your thoughts, you can do [[Pratyahara]] to cultivate the right kind of thinking.
- In the [[Bhagavad Gita|Gita]], [[Krishna]] tells [[Arjuna]] that he needs to understand that his five [[Indriya]]s are like horses that will run where they want to & will bring him along with them if he's not careful.

###### Thoughts from the inside - the unconscious, ([[Samskara]]s)
The second place thoughts come from are the inside; they come from our memories ([[Samskara]]s).
- *Example: If you have memory of mathematics, when you see '2+2', prior to thinking about '2+2', you weren't think about math in your conscious mind. Your [[Mind]] calls up the appropriate information when it thinks about the question.*
[[Samskara]]s don't only include things we've learned. Children who have been told that they suck can carry with them low self-esteem; or, children that have been told that nothing they ever do is wrong can grow up to be entitled brats.

**What we think ultimately determines what we do & shapes our life.** 
By practicing [[Pratyahara]], we can block out the bad stuff and let in the good stuff.
We can also plant good [[Samskara]]s in the mind, & learn to metabolize / digest the bad [[Samskara]]s.
