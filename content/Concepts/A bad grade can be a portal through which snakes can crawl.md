When a chair is in your way (blocking walking path), your level annoyance should be in proportion to the amount of time and energy it will take to move the - that's a proper perception. You've properly indexed the time and energy I will have to pay (the cost) to move the chair out of the way.

Often, you don't know how to index. Example: You get in a fender bender on the way to work. Suddenly all sorts of things that were irrelevant are now relevant. Have to deal with this other person, who might be a snake; deal with insurance reps; late to work; etc. Emotions unravel computing the time & effort to rectify this. The domain that is opening up as a consequence of the problem isn't easy to map. Get stressed. May need to call on outside help if you can't put your map back together.

("You won't hear this from behavioral psychologists:") When you take a step forward, & your map is correct, it reinforces the frame (which is what makes things irrelevant). (Your map being correct = progress; the frame = the game within which progress is calculated is the right game).
