Technology means systematic use of a tool.

A standardized way of doing information processing.

Improves and enhances cognition by linking brains together: your brain to your own future states of your brain, & your brain to other people's brains.

A psychotechnology fits your brain and enhances how it operates. For example: literacy.

Technologies which enhance our thinking aren’t necessarily physical, but can be psychic. For example, literacy or writing are psycho-technologies which enhance your ability to think and allow you to extend your recollection beyond your conscious awareness.
