The abstraction of any collection of personality traits with enough traces of particularity removed so that they could refer to any given person but retaining enough specificity as to not be completely generic. Archetypes are the general “template”, as it were, from which fictional characters are often drawn, especially ones in fairy tale and mythology, as they are intended to have similar applicability across multiple retellings and reinterpretations. Joseph Campbell’s The Hero of a Thousand Faces theorizes that the protagonist (Luke Skywalker, Harry Potter, etc.) of a typical Hero’s Journey (original trilogy Star Wars, the Harry Potter franchise, etc.) is such an archetype from which the gospel writers constructed Christ (C.S. Lewis, writing in the same generation, comes to the opposite conclusion, namely: that Christ was the Archetype that Nature herself as well as the other heroic myths echo, and unlike all of the other gods who supposedly died and rose again, Christ was born into human history in a land and among a people least inclined to have any sort of pagan nature religion).
