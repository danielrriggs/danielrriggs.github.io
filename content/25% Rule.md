From [[Planning & Goal Setting - Intent Model]]: [[Dharma]] allows us to do hard things (tolerate negativity, pay high costs to accomplish things). We aren't willing to pay a high cost for *wants* or *shoulds*.

 **To establish effective goals, consider the following principles:**

* **25% Rule:** Break down your goal into smaller, manageable steps to achieve progress over time. Keep cutting your actionable goal in half until it's something you'll actually do.
* **Actionable and Measurable:** Choose goals that involve specific actions you can take and measure your progress accurately.
* **Controllable:** Focus on goals that are solely dependent on your efforts so it can be positively reinforced.
* **Intent:** Establish a goal that is driven by personal values, duties, or obligations rather than external influences or shoulds.
	* If it's coming from a *want* or a *should*, can we **reframe** to move it to a *Dharma* / *Value*?
