 So let's talk a little bit about bipolar disorder. I don't think really any clinical discussion of depression is really complete without touching on bipolar disorder. It is thankfully a relatively rare illness, but can be really, really impactful for the people who suffer from it. So first thing, before we even get into bipolar disorder, we got to talk about mood lability, because nowadays everybody is bipolar. Like I hear this all the time where people are like, oh my god, my son is so bipolar. Anytime I interrupt him playing video games, he flips out and does all these terrible things. We'll also hear it from significant others like, oh my god, my partner, my girlfriend, my boyfriend is so bipolar. And what they're really describing is something that we call mood lability. So mood lability isn't really a diagnosis, it's really more of a symptom. So it's something that when your mood rapidly fluctuates. So people with mood lability can have their mood change very, very quickly over brief periods of time. So one minute you're hot, next minute you're cold, one minute you're happy, next minute you're very, very angry. We see a lot of mood lability and personality disorders. We see rapid fluctuations of mood. And true bipolar disorder doesn't really involve mood lability. What true bipolar disorder is, is fluctuating mood states that will last for weeks or months at a time, not hours or days. So once a depressive episode hits in someone with bipolar disorder, it hangs around, unfortunately, for weeks or months at a time. With the higher moods or manic or hypomanic moods, they can persist for days or weeks at a time. So let's jump into some epidemiology or some statistics about bipolar disorder. So about 1% of the population is affected by bipolar disorder, which means that 99 out of 100 people who claim they're I'm so bipolar are not actually bipolar. So it isn't nearly as common as people having mood lability. The average age of onset is about 18 years old and a gender ratio is relatively close. It's basically one to one. If you want to get super technical, it's 1.1 female to one male, but it's about one to one. So there is a strong genetic component to bipolar disorder with the average risk increasing tenfold if someone in your immediate family has bipolar disorder. And so while that sounds scary, remember that even if we increase it by tenfold, we're still going to only have a 10% chance of having bipolar disorder. So what that means is that if you have someone with bipolar disorder in your family, there's still a 90% chance that you're going to be perfectly fine. So now we're going to get to a couple of different specific diagnoses within the bipolar spectrum. So there's bipolar one and bipolar two. Both type one and type two have the same depressive episodes, which look like the depressive episodes from major depressive disorder. So we talked about the five out of nine criteria, you know, sadness and hedonia, guilt or low self-attitude, energy, concentration, appetite, sleep, sometimes suicidal thinking. So those basically look the same. In bipolar disorder, the thing that's really different though is in addition to those depressive episodes, they also have manic or hypomanic episodes. So type one bipolar disorder is characterized by periods of mania. And mania is a period of time with elevated mood for at least four days. Periods of true mania are also characterized by a drastically decreased need for sleep. In periods of real mania, I've seen, you know, patients that will literally not sleep a wink for days at a time. So people who are manic can go, you know, with two hours of sleep a night. Sometimes they don't even need to sleep at night. And the key thing here is that there are other conditions where people can not sleep for days, but people with bipolar disorder aren't affected at all. So they have persistently high energy despite not sleeping. And it seems like the neurochemistry for people with bipolar disorder is actually different from people with MDD. And that also results in slightly different treatments or actually drastically different treatments for people with bipolar disorder. And one of the interesting nuances there is that sometimes what will happen is someone will get misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder. They'll get put on an antidepressant and the antidepressant will actually trigger a manic episode. That's why it's really, really important for like the differential diagnosis to be very thorough and for people to really consult with a clinician to get the right kind of diagnosis. Now what I'm going to do is just go over something called the DSM criteria for bipolar disorder. So the DSM is the Diagnostic Statistical Manual, which is sort of the Bible of psychiatry. So these are the DSM criteria for bipolar disorder. So an inflated self-esteem or sense of grandiosity. So people think that they're wonderful or great or magnificent. A decreased need for sleep, which we touched on. People have more talkative or pressured speech. This is a really big one for, you know, if you've had a friend who's been manic, you'll really notice this where you feel like you can't get a word in. They, you know, they'll show up at your place and they'll just start talking. They'll just keep talking, talking, talking, talking, talking. And you really can't communicate with them. They just, it's really hard to talk to them. Related to pressured speech is something called flight of ideas where their mind wanders from one thing to another. So they're talking about one thing and then they talk about this and they're like, oh, did you see the weather? Oh, that cloud is really cool. That cloud looks like a tiger. By the way, did I tell you that I came up with a way of altering tiger genomes that we can inject into people so that they can start to become tiger people? Related to flight of ideas is distractibility. So their attention moves from one thing to the next. So when we think about flight of ideas, it's an internal movement. So their mind naturally goes from A to B to C to D. In distractibility, they're very bound by stimuli around them. So they get distracted by this thing and then distracted by that thing and then distracted by that thing. So distractibility is another key feature. So people with mania also have increased goal-directed activity. So they may adopt new projects. They may. One patient that I had was like all into aquaponics and spent his entire life savings in developing like an aquaponics laboratory. Speaking of spending, so another key feature is excessive involvement in what we call high cost activities. These are things like spending sprees, gambling, nowadays investing with all these apps and stuff and sometimes also like high risk sexual behavior. So it's not just money related cost. People will sort of impulsively act in ways that they normally wouldn't, which can cost them a lot. And so all it takes to get diagnosed with bipolar type one is a true, it's just one instance of a manic episode. And sometimes you'll see this where people will have three or four depressive episodes and the mania will be a little bit more rare. Another important diagnostic clarification here is that sometimes things like mania can be triggered by substances, especially stimulants. So if people are abusing their stimulant medication for ADHD, if they're using cocaine or other kinds of stimulants, they can really like get into a situation where they look manic. So in order to make a real diagnosis of bipolar disorder, you have to be kind of off of substances, which sometimes is hard to do. So that's bipolar type one. So type two bipolar disorder has periods of what we call hypomania. So these are kind of like periods of mania just tone down some. So if you people with type one bipolar disorder can have hypomania, but they can also have mania. And if you have a single episode of mania, you're kind of classified as type one. So in hypomania, your mood is elevated as well, but not quite as much. People with hypomania also experience decreased need for sleep or high energy levels, but also not quite as much. So we're talking about people who can like study for 18 hours a day and like sleep for four hours a day. They can kind of maintain a high level of energy despite sort of like suboptimal sleep. They also tend to have artistic or creative inspiration, but their mind is still able to kind of keep it together so they can actually make music, they can write really well, and so they can be a little bit more productive. Type two bipolar disorder can actually be like really, really addicting for the patient. So a lot of times patients don't want to let go of their periods of hypomania, because I want you to kind of think about it for a second, right? Like what if you had one month of your life where you only spent two hours a day sleeping and you were super focused and super productive? So people are really, really reluctant to engage in treatment because they feel that kind of like creative energy sort of like kind of leak out. But in my overwhelming experience, good treatment for bipolar disorder is absolutely worth it, because even though you kind of have a couple weeks of high productivity, you pay the price with months of depression afterward. And with the patients that I've worked with, you know, once you kind of get them balanced and kind of get them healthy, that creative energy in that healthy sort of productive cycle, you can still find that and be like just back to where you were or even better. So the last diagnosis we're going to talk about is something called cyclothymia, which is a rapidly cycling mood. It's still not quite at the level of mood lability, but it's a mood that can change within a couple of days. So people who are cyclothymic can kind of be depressed for a week and then hypomanic for three days and then kind of depressed for a week. So they do rapidly cycle between moods, but it's still not to the point of mood lability. So this video is really all about exploring bipolar disorder and just to kind of hit on the key points. So number one is mood lability doesn't make you bipolar disorder. The second thing is that, you know, people with bipolar disorder will have depressive episodes, but they'll also have manic episodes or hypomanic episodes. And that diagnosis becomes really, really important because each one has a different treatment. And just like major depressive disorder, it's really important to take kind of a comprehensive approach towards bipolar disorder and try to channel that good positive energy while remaining relatively balanced and not really paying the price of the depressive crash afterward.
