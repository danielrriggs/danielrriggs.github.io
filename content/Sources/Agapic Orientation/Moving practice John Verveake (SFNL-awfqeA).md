 So today is Umpire Day, our first Umpire Day, and I'm looking forward to this a lot. So please let's set your phones on do not disturb. Let's get into Wuji position again. We'll begin by bracing the tree for baby breaths as we do so. And now the yin-yang. Now fire in the belly. Microcosmic orbit, old man stroking the beard. Okay. Reciprocal opening. Ah and ah. Okay. Okay. Back into Wuji. Perhaps widen your stance just a little. Reeling the silk. And soften. Subtle. Smooth. And now the yin-yang. Subtle. Picking up on how things are very, very subtle. Now suffuse. Shining. Really sink. Try to feel it. Self organizing everything, moving from your dantian. Now slow it down when you can. Really feel soft and supple. Smooth and subtle. Sh. It's fused and shining. Sink into the self organizing. Reeling that silk. Just enough to pull the silk, but not too much to break it. Okay. Come back, shorten your stance a little. Bringing down the heavens. On the front. On the back. Through the core. And then all three at once. Back into Wuji position. Okay, see.
