 So today is Uppaya Day, our first Uppaya Day, and I'm looking forward to this a lot. So please let's set your phones on do not disturb. Let's get into Wuji position again. We'll begin by bracing the tree for baby breaths as we do so. And now begin your own. Now fire in the belly. Microcosmic orbit, old man stroking the beard. Okay. Reciprocal opening. All and all. Okay. Okay, now please come forward to sauce. Back into Wuji, perhaps widen your stance just a little. Reeling yourself, and but soften. Subtle, supple. Smooth. supple, picking up on how things are very very subtle. Now suffuse, shining really sink. How do you feel? Self-organizing everything, moving from your dantian. Now slow it down when you can. Really feel soft and supple, smooth and subtle, fused, shining, sink into this self-organizing. Really that silk, just enough to pull the silk, but not too much to break it. Okay, come back, your stance a little, bringing down the heavens, down the front, down the back, through the core, and then all three at once. Back in the Uji position. So we will begin when I say begin. Begin.
