 So what I'd love to do is dispel a lot of the myths around the treatment of ADHD and really help you all understand how Sort of clinicians approach really in an evidence-based manner. What is the best way to treat ADHD? So as we've already mentioned the majority of research on treatment and sort of just the research on ADHD tends to be within kids Even if we look at for example the percentages of diagnosis five percent of kids have ADHD Whereas only two point five percent of adults have ADHD So a lot of the trials that we have a lot of the studies that we have actually focus on the pediatric population And adults is somewhat similar. So studies on adults show that Basically medications and therapy work equally well. So it's not like one works better than another You know some of the appetite stuff and growth stuff is less important for adults And so oftentimes adults will take medication earlier on This too is because oftentimes that's because we're adults, right? So I may not have time for doing two hours of therapy and organizational planning and this and that On a given week. It's just easier for me to take a medication So generally speaking though, I still recommend therapy is a first-line treatment if you're an adult with ADHD and then you can combine medication you can add medication onto it if you need to and studies also show that combining medication and Therapy is more effective than doing either alone but that's where more studies also like kind of complicate the picture because there are some studies that show that over an eight week period if I do Therapy I get this much if I do medication I get this much and if I do both I get this much But then there are also studies that show that if you go a year out or two years out that Medication plus therapy is no more effective than just therapy So this is where it seems like the effect of medication and the effect of therapy seemed to like kind of move towards each other And so they're like the research is a little bit more complicated, but medication plus therapy doesn't outperform Just therapy at like one year out two years out but in the four week span in the eight week span it seems to outperform it and that kind of makes perfect sense to Because if you think about what a lot of the therapy for ADHD is and we'll go into more detail in this in a second It's very similar to what we do for kids So it's doing things like developing to-do lists using calendars becoming more organized building habits limiting distractions and that stuff takes time right so the advantage of a medication is that it tends to work really really fast so if I Take an amphetamine or Adderall or I drink a cup of coffee I instantly get some kind of improvement in focus Whereas building a habit takes longer than eight weeks So as we tunnel down into the research what we really see is that medication can be really effective and can help a lot And what you also find with a lot of patients is they notice the difference immediately right me being on Adderall or not being on Adderall is like night and day it the medication absolutely transforms my life The unfortunately thing unfortunate thing is that just because you're aware of the difference and it becomes very clear to you Doesn't mean that you need to be on Adderall for two years But what happens once you start using a stimulant medication is if you ever go off of it you lose all of that effect Right and so then people become really really attached to their stimulant medication Because it's really hard to go back to square one without it at the end of the day I tend to recommend therapy before medication when it comes to adults and now we're gonna dive into a little bit more about what Kinds of therapy we use for adults and what kind of medications we use for adults So I kind of divide the therapy for ADHD into two major buckets So one is if you look at things like cognitive behavioral therapy for ADHD It has specific protocols and these protocols tend to be somewhat similar to what we're doing for kids So it's literally teaching people Organizational skills how to reduce distractions how to prioritize how to manage some of their emotions Which can really interfere with ADHD and this kind of skill set what I what I really like about ADHD treatment Is it's the one psychiatric disease that basically everyone can benefit from the treatment So even someone who doesn't have ADHD can benefit from being more organized Even someone who doesn't have ADHD can benefit from understanding their emotions better and reducing distractions in their life Especially in this day of like overwhelming technological input So that CBT Kind of camp or that CBT camp of therapy is really about organizational skills building routines habits, etc The other thing that I've sort of discovered in treating adults with ADHD is that oftentimes Growing up as a child with ADHD comes with emotional or almost traumatic consequences And so if you're thinking about you know If you think about an adult and growing up as a kid with ADHD You're not really able to pay attention in class you get into trouble when you fight with kids on the playground You don't really wait for your turn and if you think a little bit about what that does to a kid, right? You start to avoid activities. There's nothing that you're really great at or maybe there's just one thing that you're great at and for a lot Of these adults they weren't diagnosed with ADHD as kids So they didn't really get the appropriate support that they needed And so what that results in is amount a large amount of like shame sort of like self-esteem issues and almost like Losing out on the joy of childhood because ADHD robbed you of it And so that in and of itself requires some amount of therapy and this is where we're not really focusing on how to deal with The ADHD now we're not focusing on how you can be more successful at work or how you can build healthier relationships We're really focusing on healing the damage from growing up as a child with ADHD So that's kind of the second camp of therapy that oftentimes I'll engage in that's a little bit more Psychodynamic in nature so it's more kind of like talking about your feelings and like crying with your therapist and like having cathartic breakthroughs and like that kind of stuff and So that's sort of what we think about for therapy in the medication camp I'm gonna sort of simplify this into two options which is stimulant medication and non stimulant medication So stimulant medication includes things like methylphenidate or or amphetamine salts. So these are things that in the US will call things like Ritalin or Adderall and it there are non stimulant medications as well things like bupropion or Atom oxetine for adults as well. There's some like different kinds of meds that are not stimulants So the key thing to think about in terms of whether a stimulant is appropriate or not appropriate or whether they're how they work The first is that stimulants work real fast and boy can you tell a difference? And since you can immediately tell a difference a lot of times patients really really like them, right? So I take my Adderall in the morning and I'm like I can focus for the next six hours like no problem whatsoever I'm an absolute beast. I can get all my work done So oftentimes people will get pretty attached to using stimulant medication The downsides of stimulant medication are oftentimes there are side effects so they can interfere with things like sleep They can make people feel jittery they can make people feel because it is a stimulant, right? so we'll get into this more when we talk about the neuroscience of it, but The way that stimulant medications work is they essentially stimulate the inhibitory parts of our brain So if we think about ADHD my mind is getting distracted because it's Overactive and it's thinking about this and thinking about this and thinking about this So when we stimulate when we use stimulant medication what it allows is that it strengthens the part of our brain that Rains in the other parts of our brain It almost strengthens the brakes in our brain as opposed to revving up the gas pedal The problem is that even though it has that effect in the brain it revs up the gas pedal in the rest of our body Right so stimulant medications will increase our heart rate They'll sometimes increase our blood pressure can affect our appetite can make it hard for us to sleep can make us feel kind of jittery And restless so when we take a medication that gets distributed all through our body And so sometimes we can see a lot of side effects with that The other concern that we have is that stimulants are sometimes abused or even unfortunately our cases Sold to people who will abuse them when I was in residency in Boston I think a one month supply of a stimulant medication like Adderall would go for anywhere between one and two thousand dollars So what people would do is like you know get a month's prescription of Adderall and then like sell it for 1500 grand on the street Unfortunately stimulant medication can be abused so we want to be really really careful with people have a history of addiction Oftentimes there's also some research that shows that you can still prescribe it to people have a history of addiction Addicted to other things like alcohol and opiates ideally but but we have to be really careful about potential for abuse Potential for addiction and even potential for things like diversion For non stimulant medication that's when we'll sort of think a little bit about non stimulant medication although you can also use it first line They tend to work comparably well the things about non stimulant medication is you're not going to have to deal with the abuse Concerns you're not going to have to deal with some of these You know side effect concerns and things like that They'll have their own side effects, but they tend to be easier to tolerate the main thing about non stimulant medication for ADHD Is that it takes time to work? So it's not going to be like popping a stimulant medication and instantly feeling the effect Sometimes so the met non stimulant medications for ADHD will take weeks to work and this can be really confusing for patients if they miss that So this is what happens when you go in and you talk to your psychiatrist about medication, right? They'll sit down with you for like 15 or 20 minutes, and they'll like shoot lots of information at you They'll ask you like 10 questions in about 30 seconds, and then they'll say a little bit They'll be like okay. Here's the thing that you have to watch out about the medication you got to watch out for this I'll watch out for this we've got to watch out for this you got to watch out for this you understand Oh by the way this this this and this and you're like yeah, okay, and then they give you the medication I'm sure it'll work great for you. Good luck come back in a month And so we sometimes lose sight of the fact that non stimulant medications can take weeks to work And so sometimes what we'll see is that patients will try it for a couple of days They may get a little bit upset stomach or some kind of side effect But it's not you know their life hasn't been transformed and here they are talking to their friends who got a stimulant medication And they're like on day one. I felt like a completely different person And they're like I want the good stuff right screw this non stimulant medication And then they come back to the psychiatrist and like this medication isn't working and they're like, please give me the stimulant Right and then the psychiatrist says no give it a couple more weeks And then the patient is like screw you and then they call someone else and they're like, hey, can I get stimulant medication? That happens unfortunately a lot So stimulant medication can work really well non stimulant medication can work really well Just remember that stimulants work faster than non stimulants The other thing to remember just in general about treatment is that it's not binary in terms of working or not Working which is something that I see People are getting increasingly confused about right So if you look at like forums about ADHD or like discussions about ADHD or tick talks about ADHD This is a 60 second bit of information or one comment where one person is like man I got diagnosed with ADHD and I got put on a medication and it transformed my life Period right so you'll you'll see like three sentences or a 60 second clip about how medication revolutionized their life And so then what happens is it creates this idea that it's kind of binary I get the diagnosis I get the meds and then my life should be transformed But the truth is is that ADHD treatment just like all other psychiatric treatments Takes time and effort to figure out because medication doesn't affect every person the same way Just think about this for a second right does everyone like pizza the same way does everyone handle dairy the same way does everyone break out? When they eat a particular kind of you know cow's milk and some people can handle a whole goat's milk or sheep's milk And some people do fine with tofu some people are allergic to soybeans So the things that we put into our body affect us differently ADHD is not the same in every single person That's why the diagnostic criteria are so varied and as we go into the neuroscience We'll start to see how that it's even more varied than the diagnostic criteria suggest So any kind of treatment that you engage in the most important thing to remember is that it's not that treatment works Or doesn't work it's that you keep trying until you figure out What's the right formula for you and if we just look at what we've talked about today? We can see that right so if you go to a CBT therapist for your ADHD, and you're working on organizational skills Prioritization and habit building and reducing distractions that may work for some of the stuff, but what about all the shame? What about like being 24 years old when you graduate from college and like whereas your friends are graduated at the age of 21 because they're super smart The organization using a calendar doesn't fix that right so you may need a different kind of treatment And the true is the same is absolutely true for things like medication people have different dosages There are lots of different medications to try so it's not like medication didn't work for me It's what was the dose when did you take it? This is another thing that's really important for ADHD medication especially this is where people you know when you take it is very important So for something like let's say Antidepressant medication or your arthritis medication you may be able to take it at any time in the day But when it comes to ADHD medication there's short-acting medication, and there's long-acting medication So for some people what they really like is they like the long-acting medication because they take one pill in the morning They don't forget it in the morning, and then the medication lasts for about six to eight hours So you kind of get through the workday And then you have no problems going to bed at night for other people what they really find is that the long-acting Medication doesn't kind of give them enough in the morning or in the afternoon so instead what they'll do is take short-acting medication Twice a day once at 8 a.m.. And once at 1 p.m.. But then they're sort of also the medication wears out of their system by the time that they go home For other people you know they need a higher dose of long-acting medication So there are a lot of different variables here that you can move around to try to figure out okay When do you really need your mind to focus when do you need to get work done? When can you afford to be a little bit disorganized like not that big of a deal when I'm cooking when I'm picking up groceries Okay, I have my grocery list so I'm not gonna forget that but when I'm really at work And it's 10 a.m.. And you've been sitting in meetings for two hours, and you're going into your third meeting of the day You're gonna be listening to some guy talking for the next hour like you need that medication right you can't get up and walk around You don't get to smell or cook or the oven isn't gonna beep like it's it's torture unless you have your medication So it's a very individualized approach and don't give up just because something doesn't work if something doesn't work That's absolutely a conversation that you need to have with your doctor just to give you guys a sense I will oftentimes work with people for three to six months to try to figure out okay What is the perfect medication regimen for you? What's the right amount of therapy? What's the right amount of organizational skills? Do you need help with a calendar or is what we need to do like help you clear distractions from your you know your phone? Or your technology usage and so keep at it right don't give up Hope and remember it can be very very customized so sometimes people will go to see a psychiatrist or a therapist and You know here we are talking about meditation and dietary changes and all these like organizational things you can do in therapy and like Processing the emotions of growing up as a kid with ADHD when no one ever let you play with them because you were always cutting in Line you kind of go see a doctor right we say go see a therapist you go see a doctor and they like talk to you For five minutes they give you a checklist you check some boxes. They're like here's a prescription adios right so that unfortunately is a Lot of the experience that people have so one of the things that we tend to see is that as mental health is kind of developing It's kind of developing in the wrong direction sometimes and that sometimes unfortunately the best way to get paid as a Medical mental health professional is to just prescribe medication Because if I'm spending 15 minutes with a patient I can see four patients an hour instead of one patient an hour who I spend Time talking to and that just makes me more money And so it's unfortunate that that that is the truth of the situation sometimes So if you were in that situation where you feel like someone is just jumping to medication I would encourage you to share that with the person and say hey I recognize that you made a diagnosis and you're recommending medication, but I really want to understand what my options are What are the alternatives? I'd love to have a conversation about What are the different treatment approaches to for ADHD because I'm not really Ready to start medication yet, and that's where you'll see how the provider responds And they may say well, it's like take it or leave it like this is what I recommend It's what works for the you know the most patients that I've seen if you really want to you can also like kind of push Back on that a little bit more and you're like well. It sounds like that's all you do you know, but I wouldn't say that What I'd also ask for is if at the end of the day you're not happy with your psychiatrist What I would do is ask for a referral Do you have recommendations for psychiatrists who are willing to consider? Other non pharmacologic things or will incorporate pharmacology into a more comprehensive treatment plan And I really really encourage you to use that sentence because that sentence highlights the psychiatrist how bad of a psychiatrist They are because it helps them realize that there isn't a comprehensive treatment plan. They're just reaching for a medication So by all means ask for something or ask questions If you're not happy with medication right say hey, I'm interested in non-pharmacological treatment Or incorporating medicine into a broader more comprehensive treatment plan and you can just ask are there other people out there that you know that do that kind of thing more than you do And you know I think it's very very important that if you're unhappy with your mental health provider Remember that like they're there to serve you right like they may have a lot of power in the relationship for sure But at the end of the day a doctor is not the only one who's going to be there to help you And if you feel like your needs are not being met by all means vocalize that vocalize that in a respectful way And then try to find someone else who's more aligned with what you're looking for It doesn't necessarily mean that the doctor has to change and adapt exactly to what you do They may be doing what they're doing for a good reason and that just may be their experience But it's totally fine to shop around until you find someone who's more aligned with like your treatment plan The last thing that we're going to talk about is something that people are very very interested in nowadays and especially with ADHD Which is complementary alternative medicine You know before I did this whole healthy gamer business I was actually focused on integrating evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine into psychiatric practice That's where I really developed my interest in things like meditation and interest in things like Ayurveda and all that Unfortunately ADHD is one of the diagnoses where there's the least evidence for good CAM interventions So aside from meditation which has overwhelming evidence that it's very very effective Everything else is kind of like a doesn't really work great okay So let's talk about meditation first So the cool thing about meditation we'll get into that in a minute So let's talk about meditation first So the cool thing about meditation we'll go into this in more detail when we dig into neuroscience Is that meditation works directly on many parts of the brain that have deficits in ADHD So meditation boosts our frontal lobes, it boosts our emotional regulation, it boosts our ability to focus It keeps us from getting distracted, it does all kinds of things So meditation is actually really really good for ADHD We'll even go into specific meditations that are designed for people with ADHD The next things that we're going to talk about are essentially a lot of people have done studies on diet And so people are curious if I change my diet can I sort of adjust my ADHD So there are a couple of early studies for example that showed that So there's one study I'll just give you all an example That showed that fish oil supplementation or omega-3 supplementation Seem to have a positive impact at reducing ADHD symptoms And so people got really really excited and they were like oh I don't need to take medication I don't even need to meditate, all I need to do is take a fish oil supplement, fantastic it will cure my ADHD And so when more people did it what we sort of found is that people weren't benefiting so much from it And then researchers dug down even further and dug down even further And what they actually discovered is that there are different genes in ADHD And so depending on which gene allele you have some people have a certain kind of deficient allele Where if you supplement omega-3 they get a big boost in terms of ADHD symptom reduction But if you're in the two thirds of the population that doesn't have that allele That omega-3 supplementation doesn't help you at all So this is the kind of thing where if you really look at it does omega-3 work Well it seems to like help in about a third of people That also is a Caucasian population if memory serves So that you know alleles tend to be different across ethnicities as well And so people have looked at other things so people have found kind of signals of dietary changes helping So another thing that got a lot of interest is actually like additives, preservatives and artificial colors So there are some studies in children that showed that like sort of removing preservatives and artificial coloring From the diet seemed to improve ADHD symptoms And so people kind of tunneled that down into that further And really found that the effect once you apply to a large population seemed to get smaller and smaller and smaller And so once again that's sort of a situation where it appears that some kids Are sensitive to that kind of thing and something about the way that they digest food Something about the way that their metabolism is makes their ADHD worse if you sort of have artificial foods and preservatives Another thing that people have talked a lot about is carbohydrate to protein ratios So this is something that I think is more generally helpful But if you sort of eat less junk like simple carbohydrates and sugar and have a higher protein diet That appears to help symptoms of ADHD And we're not quite sure how that works But one of the things that we're sort of learning in medicine is that eating trash tends to make stuff worse Like I don't know how else to put it right And so you can go into detailed science and we may do that at some point But at the end of the day like you know if you eat like crap like your obesity is going to get worse Your arthritis is going to get worse your depression is going to get worse your ADHD is going to get worse And if you eat healthier like if you eat fiber and stuff like that's going to help I'm sure there's more complicated stuff to it I'm sure there's more detail to it But the studies really don't show that there's a huge transformative impact But people keep on kind of looking into this stuff And the key thing to remember about dietary interventions because that's where most of the kind of CAM or alternative medicine studies are going The key thing about dietary changes is that the one conclusion we can make is that you know aside from just generally eating better A lot of this stuff seems to be very individual So when parents come to me and they'll say like oh I've heard that you know my kid has ADHD and I was listening to a podcast The Happy Moms and Happy Kids podcast And in the Happy Moms Happy Kids podcast there was a happy mom who was talking about how much happier their kid was Once we removed artificial coloring from their diet So unfortunately they never get to go to birthday parties anymore because cupcakes always have artificial coloring So I just don't let him go to birthdays but he's a happy kid now So people will sort of come in with this stuff and they'll be like what do you think about this doctor? And what I'll sort of say is like by all means try it out But the data suggests as we sort of do more and more studies it seems like there's an individual variance In terms of the response to dietary changes in ADHD So you're going to have to kind of experiment on your own and we'll do our best to guide you a little bit there But unfortunately there isn't like a really powerful dietary intervention that you can make that appears to really profoundly impact ADHD In terms of herbal supplements and other kinds of things there really isn't great data on that stuff I know that nowadays everyone's talking about nootropics and cognitive enhancers Taking things like ashwagandha and this kind of stuff to like improve mood and focus and green tea extract and stuff like that I mean a lot of that stuff is just like straight caffeine And if you look at like supplements that are cognitive enhancers just see if they put caffeine in it Because that can account for a lot of it and then there's not really great data about the rest of it I mean there are some studies that show that some of this stuff kind of works But when applied to larger populations when sort of you know taken outside of like a very small isolated clinical trial We just don't really know yet So at the end of the day treatment for ADHD is actually more varied than people realize There are a lot of things that people kind of get wrong about it The first is that it doesn't have to happen right away right it doesn't have to work right away That medications can be a part of it or not a part of it That you can learn organizational skills as an adult and you can sort of process the trauma of growing up with ADHD And that seems to really make people happier and like better at doing stuff A lot of the research that we have is focused on kids because ADHD for you know historically has been a pediatric diagnosis And we even see that reflected in the amount of children who are diagnosed with ADHD Versus the amount of adults who are diagnosed with ADHD Unfortunately the rate of ADHD is increasing across the board and I think the adults are catching up So the most important thing to remember about treatment for ADHD is that if it doesn't work don't lose heart There are a ton of modifications that you can make right and the reason that we're sharing with you that there are organizational therapies There are kind of emotional therapies there are stimulant medications there are non stimulant medications You can adjust the dosage of your medications you can adjust the time of administration of medications There are lots of different things that you can do and even if you don't want to do any of that you can also do meditation There are lots of different meditations there are even dietary changes you can make you can cut out you know the villain of the modern day Which is gluten and maybe that will make a difference the truth is we don't really know until we try it So don't lose hope just because you've tried something for ADHD and it didn't really seem to work The goal of this this particular lecture in this module is to help you understand there are a lot of different options out there And if this kind of stuff appeals to you by all means go see a licensed clinician because they're the people that are going to be trained To help you develop a tailored plan that will work for you
