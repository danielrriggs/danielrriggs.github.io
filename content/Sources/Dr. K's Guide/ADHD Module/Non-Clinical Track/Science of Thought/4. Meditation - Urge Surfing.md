 This next practice is something called urge surfing and this practice is also a little bit different because it's not sort of Something that you do formally by sitting down So some meditative practices are formal practices of meditation Which is when we sit down we close our eyes and we actually meditate as a verb urge surfing is a different kind of meditation practice that requires us to sort of have some urge to begin with and Remember that a lot of meditation isn't necessarily about sitting down and quote-unquote meditating the purpose of meditation is to help us understand Ourselves how we work and even the nature of the world around us so in this next practice urge surfing will understand a little bit about what kind of behaviors control us and What sort of how we shape our desires and our cravings over time? So before we dive into the practice itself I want to share with you all something from sort of the realm of child psychology or child development Sometimes you'll have parents who will sort of have some kind of conflict with a young child so the kid wants to eat an additional cookie or they want to spend more time watching a screen or Whatever thing that they want and so what will happen is the parent will say no and then the kid will kind of escalate and Eventually what'll happen is the kid will start crying and as the kid starts crying or as the kid starts throwing a temper tantrum What a lot of parents will do is they want to calm the kid down and so they'll relent right? Oh, no, no, no, we're done with screen time today. No more episodes of this. This is your last game It's time to go to bed and the kid will be like, ah But sometimes kids will throw a temper tantrum sometimes they'll get upset and if the parent relents at that point There's something really subtle going on because what is the behavior that you're actually Reinforcing in that moment the parent may be thinking. Okay, I just need to do whatever I can to calm down the kid But if the kid wants to watch TV, what is the behavior that they engage in that actually gets them the television? It's actually throwing a temper tantrum. So over time by giving into temper tantrums What we're essentially doing is training the kid Teaching the kid that if you want to watch TV What you have to do is throw a temper tantrum because if you ask nicely your parent will say no but if you throw a temper tantrum and you start throwing Objects and you start crying then the parent will give you what you want And so over time this is very perplexing for parents because the more that they sort of give into this behavior The more of this behavior they're trying they start to see and the tricky thing is they're trying to put a stop to the behavior Right, that's why I give them the the video game or the iPad or whatever because I want to turn off the temper tantrum But over time even though I may be turning off the temper tantrum in that moment What I'm signing myself up for is more temper tantrums down the road Now this may sort of sound like common sense after I explained it or perhaps it's revolutionary But the truth of the matter is this is not just for kids This is actually something that happens in our mind on a daily basis So if we think about something like a craving So sometimes we're addicted to a substance or we're addicted to a particular kind of food or something like that or even a video game And as we try to resist the impulse to engage in that let's say I need to study But I want to play this game and so I ten minutes go by and I'm resisting and resisting and my desire for the game increases increases increases over time as the desire increases it becomes harder for me to study and Eventually what happens is I give into the craving and I start playing the video game itself And this is also true for substances of abuse So people who are addicted to things like alcohol or opiates or even things like marijuana Will sort of resist the impulse right because you don't want to be an addict you want to be in control You don't want the substance to be in control But what ends up happening is as you resist and as you resist and as you resist the craving grows and grows and grows and grows and then eventually you give in because the stronger the craving is the Harder it is to resist it So something subtle is happening in that moment because the part of your brain that wants the opiates or wants the marijuana Wants the video game. What is it learning about how to manipulate your behavior? What is it learning about sort of shaping what you do? So if my body in this can sometimes happen, especially if we have a physiologic dependence My neurons can crave alcohol for people who are addicted to alcohol not having alcohol can actually be fatal sudden withdrawal from alcohol can actually create seizures in the brain and Arrhythmia is in the heart and so as our brain gets closer and closer to having a seizure from alcohol withdrawal the cravings intensify and intensify and intensify And then suddenly for the brain of an alcoholic getting that alcohol becomes a situation of life and death It's no longer an addiction. It's almost like someone who's thirsty or starving craving food and water Something subtle happens that we're usually not really aware of is that we actually Reinforce the power of the craving by waiting for the desire for a particular thing to rise What we're actually doing is training our brain that oh the only way I'm gonna give you alcohol is if you crave it really really hard and this is what's so confusing for people who are struggling to Play fewer gay play fewer video games or get off of a substance. Is there actually? Reinforcing their brains cravings in the same way that a parent is reinforcing a child's temper tantrums So what are we gonna do about this? This is exactly why we're gonna teach all a technique called urge surfing So generally speaking when we have a craving the craving grows over time and eventually we give into it But instead what we're gonna do is surf above the urge and that may sound kind of weird But there's one really important principle from yoga that I want to share with y'all Which is that anything in the mind is temporary by nature? So this is not something that we really think about but we tend to you know Try to do all kinds of things to make us happy. But how long does that happiness last? So for example nowadays, I hear a lot of stories about bride zillas So these are brides that want the perfect wedding. This is their magical day. It's the day of their dreams So everything has to be perfect on their wedding day And so what they'll end up doing is forcing people to wear particular things they'll tell other people to not come to the wedding because you know They look fitter in a particular dress than the bride does and this is the bride's day to shine, right? And the bride is supposed to be the prettiest person in the room So if one of their friends is more attractive than they are in their mind that person gets uninvited and so over time chasing this perfect wedding day becomes really really challenging and Even if that's okay, even if we assume that you can sort of do whatever you want to to create the perfect wedding day I have a question for you. How long does the happiness from your perfect wedding day last? Because the resentment from a non perfect wedding day can certainly last for a very long time But do you think that bride zillas will be happy for the rest of their lives because this one day went perfectly? Of course not. So just think a little bit about your own emotions. Think about the last time you did something that made you happy How long did the happiness last? This is true of negative emotions as well So I I'm sure I was afraid of a dog at some point growing up But being afraid of a dog when I was six years old doesn't persist to today. I'm not still afraid The nature of emotions and the nature of the mind is to fluctuate This is exactly why boredom is so crippling because if you don't give the mind some way to fluctuate it sort of starts to go A little bit crazy So this is an important thing to understand when it comes to urge surfing because we don't actually have to Win against the craving the purpose of urge surfing is to recognize all we have to do is procrastinate All we have to do is delay and that's exactly what urge surfing is like Because cravings and desires are like waves they start to grow they start small they grow grow grow they crest and it's a gigantic wave and Eventually, it'll break apart and so much like a surfer who rides the wave what we actually want to do is ride the urge It's sort of the acknowledgement that if you observe The rise of an urge or craving in your in your body or in your mind You'll observe this precise thing and this is exactly what the technique is is the next time you start to feel a desire or you Start to feel a craving give your full attention to it. Don't actually resist it But don't also give into it What we really want to do is watch it and watch it as fully as we can Watch how each minute that goes by does it grow or does it shrink each hour that goes by does it grow or does it? Shrink and what we want to do is watch the whole duration of it And so as we watch it grow and grow and grow eventually we'll also see that it starts to shrink and shrink and shrink And so this is where the temporal dimension becomes important for the mind as well because when we feel an urge We think to ourselves. I won't be able to resist this forever I can only resist it for so long But the thing is you don't need to resist it forever. You just need to resist it for this moment And so if you want to understand how to overcome your desires and your cravings you have to learn how to urge surf So as you feel that urge close your eyes and use whatever meditative technique fits you well, whether it's a breathing technique or listening to internal sounds or Even sort of like chanting a mantra repeating a mantra silently in your mind Just ride above that urge because if you're able to successfully do it once Over time what you'll be doing is sort of training the kid to stop throwing temper tantrums What you'll be doing is training your mind that cravings aren't gonna get you what you want So there's no point in producing them and once your brain learns that cravings don't control you the cravings will naturally subside So this is the goal of urge surfing. It's really really hard to sort of do from the beginning But with practice and with diligence, hopefully you'll get the hang of it and learn how to surf
