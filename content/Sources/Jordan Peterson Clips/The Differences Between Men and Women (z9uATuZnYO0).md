 Men and women tend to have their own sex-typed temperaments. So women are, on average, higher in negative emotion, and higher in agreeableness. And then there are minor distinctions with the rest of the traits, which I won't go into now, because they're much smaller. But on average, women are more agreeable. They're more self-sacrificing in relationship to others, which goes along with their propensity to care for infants, because you have to do that when you care for infants. And they're more threat and negative emotion sensitive. And that might be because, well, you could argue that the world is actually objectively more dangerous for women because they're vulnerable on the sexual front and because they're smaller physically, but also that the world needs to be reacted to to some degree as if it's a more threatening place because women are charged with the primary care of infants and infants are very vulnerable.
