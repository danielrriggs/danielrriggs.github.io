 So what do you think you found so compelling about it, especially when you were reading about other faiths at the same time? I think there was two things. I mean, obviously, you know, so many, so many, you know, stories in the Bible were compelling to me. But one of the things that got me, I became a New Testament guy, because I really focused on, you know, the manhood of Jesus, number one. I wanted to really look into Jesus' character, since he's the basis about faith, and what kind of a guy he was, because remember this, George, my whole life, from the time I was a kid, right through the time I was in that life, the standard we had to live up to was to be a man's man. That's it. You had to have integrity, you had to be strong, you had to be courageous and tough, and treat women the right way was always that. So I wanted to see, I wanted to study Jesus of Nazareth first to establish if he was the kind of man that I would follow. And he obviously came through with flying colors for me with that.
