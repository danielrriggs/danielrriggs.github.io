 Because religion is inevitable and we're seeing it coming back in very strange ways. It's going to be a weird, woke, identitarian religion. And primitive, you know, part of it's going to be intent doesn't matter. Can you believe that? Yeah. So it's a scary thing. Like, that's what you could say that that's one of the failures of the new atheists is that what they partly led to the new woke phenomenon because they didn't realize that you can't get rid of religion. You can't get rid of rituals. You can't get rid of the problems and opportunities of identity. All of these things are going to come back. If you try to brush them aside, then they're going to come back in very weird ways. And without you realizing what's going on, you'll have people kneeling to a shrine of a man who was killed by police and putting a halo on his head and, you know, and self-mortifying themselves and doing all kinds of insane things or that look to you insane, but that you need to understand it's just this religious impulse gone off the rails.
