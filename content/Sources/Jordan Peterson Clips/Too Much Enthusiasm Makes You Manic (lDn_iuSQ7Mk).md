 Too much enthusiasm makes you manic. Every trait pushed to its extreme can degenerate into a pathology. And that's true of all of them. You might think you can't be too creative. It's like, oh yes you can. You see patterns everywhere, even when they're not there. And it's very difficult for highly creative people to catalyze an identity because they're interested in everything. That's different than being enthusiastic about everything. You can be interested in everything without thinking, everything's a great idea and let's get on it. It's certainly the case that you can have too much fun. One of the things that was painful about having children was the realization of how much time you spend disciplining them because they're having too much fun. Because they run around and they get too excited and then they wear themselves out or they trip over things or bump into each other. It's like, settle down, settle down. You think, I'm educating my children not to be happy. Well, everything has its limits.
