 Guilt is generally with regard to others, and shame is with regard to yourself before God. And what religion really is about is shifting the source of your feelings of inadequacy from what everybody else thinks of you to your inadequacy before God, which is really something else that's really shame. And so we have a culture that's very much focused on guilt, meaning I, as a member of a group, should feel inadequate before members of this other group, which doesn't make a whole hell of a lot of sense unless you particularly have sinned against a member of this other group. But what religion says is something else. It says that you should feel shame because you've fallen short of God. And that shame is something that can drive you to individual action. I think our society is moving back toward almost a pagan sense of guilt, rather than the internalized sense of shame, which is what biblical religion is really rooted in, right? It takes all of the sins that you commit against your fellow creature, and it says that's not a sin against your fellow creature, predominantly. It's sin against them, but it's also a sin against God.
