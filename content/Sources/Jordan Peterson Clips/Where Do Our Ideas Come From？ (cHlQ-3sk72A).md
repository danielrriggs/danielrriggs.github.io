 Let's say that I'm a scientist and a bright idea strikes me or I'm an artist and a bright intuition strikes me. Now I have two options when I'm considering that source. I could consider that a manifestation of the same spirit of intuition and revelation that has made itself manifest as part and parcel of the creative enterprise of all of mankind since the dawn of time, right? A continuance of that same process which insinuates something transpersonal about it, right? It's the operation of something transcendent or I can take personal credit for it and say, I thought it up. The problem with the latter approach, as far as I can tell, is first of all, I think it's in cautious and unwarranted because the great scientists have always said that they stand on the shoulders of giants and can see farther for that reason is we are part of a great collective creative enterprise and God only knows how deep that goes.
