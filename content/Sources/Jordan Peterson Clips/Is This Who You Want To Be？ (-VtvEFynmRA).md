 At some point, every young man realizes nasty guys get more sex, and they realize that people who push women around can be very successful. And you have to say to yourself, is that who I want to be? What the psychopaths and narcissists, the Machiavellians, and even the sadists do, the men, the false confidence of the narcissist is a mimicry of competence. And that can be put on very early. And young women are particularly susceptible to that camouflage. And that partly accounts for the differential success of, you know, bad boys, let's say. Now, it's partly because the women are looking for the beast that can be turned into the ally. It's not easy for them to distinguish the beast who is beast right to the bloody core and should be stayed away from in every possible way from the potentially redeemable, you know, Philip Marlowe hero.
