 We have roughly 3,000 people arrested a year for offensive things that they have said online. So in other words, nine people a day roughly the police in the UK are arresting. If you see the Twitter accounts of various police forces, various police departments across the country, they often put things out like, make sure you don't say anything offensive or thoughtless online or we will be knocking on your door. There was a recent police display outside a supermarket. It went viral, this image. The slogan on the billboard was, being offensive is an offense, and this was flanked by police officers who were socially distanced but they were there in their masks which made it seem slightly even more sinister. They got in a lot of trouble for that because people were saying, well, being offensive surely isn't a crime. But actually the problem with that is that the police clearly thought it was a crime and they, you know, they were acting on that basis. They obviously hadn't just concocted this billboard out of nothing. They'd really considered what it should say. And more to the point, actually they were right. In this country you can go to prison for jokes, for offensive remarks, and people have gone to prison, have been arrested routinely for causing offense.
