 Why aren't there more women in positions of power? Wrong question. The right question is, why are there any men at all who want those positions of power? Because it's not just positions of power. You have to be such a nothead to think that. Oh, it's a position of power. It's like, sure, but it's a position of overwhelming responsibility. And if you make mistakes, you're done, right? It's not like you occupy that position of power and everyone does what they're told all the time and your life is easy. It's like, forget about that. People are on your case to do exactly the right thing all the time, 100% of the time. And maybe you want that, maybe you don't. So, I don't know what people think, is these people are all sitting in their offices with their feet up on the desk smoking cigars and oppressing the world. It's like, that isn't how it works. Those people, they work flat out all the time.
