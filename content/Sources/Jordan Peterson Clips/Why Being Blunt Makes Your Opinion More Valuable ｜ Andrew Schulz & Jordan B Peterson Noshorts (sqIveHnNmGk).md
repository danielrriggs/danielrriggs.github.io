 I have a friend, Laurence, this guy was so honest with us. And we just assumed it was because he was European. Like we just grew up in New York. We never heard anybody just be that honest. Like we've been, you know, what do you think of the pants? And he'd be like, ah, they just don't fit you. You're too fat for the pants. But I'll tell you something. Whenever that guy says something complimentary, I believe it more. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's definitely worth thinking about too. Are we willing to pay the price for our words to be valuable? That's a great phrase because the price is you don't want to debase the currency that says the problem with every child wins a trophy day. If everything is valuable, then everything is of equal value. And that equal value is zero because everything can't be valuable. It isn't possible. Nothing is valuable when everything is valuable. There has to be a differential. There has to be judgment. There has to be hierarchy that people are upset about. It's like, wait a minute. Do you not want some things to be better than others? Wait a second. Are you sure about that? You don't want to be better tomorrow than you are today.
