 I've been talking a lot to the crowds that I've been talking to, not about rights, but about responsibility. Right? You can't have the conversation about rights without the conversation about responsibility, because your rights are my responsibility. That's what they are, technically. So, you just can't have only half of that discussion, and we're only having half that discussion. The question is, well, what the hell are you leaving out, if you only have that half of the discussion? And the answer is, well, you're leaving out responsibility. And then the question is, well, what are you leaving out if you're leaving out responsibility? And the answer might be, well, maybe you're leaving out the meaning of life. That's what it looks like to me. It's like, here you are. Suffering away. What makes it worthwhile? Rights? It's almost impossible to describe how bad an idea that is. Responsibility. That's what gives life meaning.
