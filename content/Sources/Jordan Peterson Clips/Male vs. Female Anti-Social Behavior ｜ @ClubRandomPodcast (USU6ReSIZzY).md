 There are male patterns of antisocial behavior and there are female patterns. And the male pattern tends to tilt towards physical violence which is partly why almost everyone who's in prison is male because we really put the clamps down on physical violence. But the female antisocial pattern, which is well established by the way in the clinical literature, is reputation savaging, gossip mongering and exclusion. So this is what chicks do as opposed to us. You bet. You're so right. When men are like, I'll kill you and women are like, I'll make you kill yourself. Right, right, right, right. Yeah, yeah. I'll make you wish you were dead. Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. No, I'll actually make you kill yourself because that happens a lot. That's online bullying, right?
