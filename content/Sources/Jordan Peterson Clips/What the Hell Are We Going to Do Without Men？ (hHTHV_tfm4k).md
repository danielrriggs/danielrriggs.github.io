 We've met some of your fans and we got the impression, they were all male fans, the ones that we talked to, and that they were struggling with their manhood and that you give them this message that it's okay to be a man. It's not okay, it's necessary. What the hell are we going to do without men? You look around the city here, you see all these buildings go up, these men, they're doing impossible things, they're under the streets, working on the sewers, they're up on the power lines in the storms and the rain, they're keeping this impossible infrastructure functioning, this thing that works in a miraculous manner. They work themselves to death and often literally the gratitude for that is sorely lacking, especially among the people who should be most grateful.
