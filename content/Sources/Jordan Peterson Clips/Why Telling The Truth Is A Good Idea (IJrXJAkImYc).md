 Partly what I'm doing is helping people walk through thinking about why telling the truth is a good idea. Not as a top-down, shake-your-finger moral injunction, don't lie, you shouldn't lie. But in a detailed manner to explain the relationship between the instrumental use of deceit and the collapse of civilizations. And that connection is way closer than people think. Well, it turns out that what you do matters. And basically what I'm doing is touring and talking to people face-to-face. Everyone says, well, we want meaning in our life. Do you now? Because you might ask yourself, what's the more threatening possibility? That nothing you do matters, which means you can pretty much do whatever you want. That's the upside of that nihilistic claim. No responsibility, right? And why not pursue narrow-focused hedonism, since nothing matters anyways? So that's the shadow of nihilism. Or everything you do matters.
