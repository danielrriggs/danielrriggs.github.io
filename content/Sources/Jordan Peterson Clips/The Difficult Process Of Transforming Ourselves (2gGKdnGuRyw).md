 You already know everything in some sense. You know, you've got a map that covers the whole world. Which is sort of why you can function. And so as long as everything's going fine, you don't really have to adjust your map and you don't have to think. But then if you come across something that makes you think, then what that means is that part of the way you were thinking was wrong. And so when you think something, when you're forced to, then some little part of what you were, your map, the way you represent the world, it has to die. Because it was wrong. And then it has to be replaced by this new thing. And God only knows how much of what it was that was there has to die. That's part of the magnitude of error problem. And so people don't like to think. And so it's hard to read difficult books, like Beyond Good and Evil, because you're just forced to think and think and it's just exhausting. Which is why they're trying to not teach difficult books in universities anymore. So that people don't have to undergo the difficult process of actually having to think and transform themselves.
