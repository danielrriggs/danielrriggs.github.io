 Many men are petrified by women. They won't approach them at all. They have no idea how to talk to them. They're just petrified into immobility. And that's way more common than you think. And so that breeds resentment like you wouldn't believe, you know. You hear the guy who shot up like Dawson College. It's like, what the hell do you think motivated him? It's like, he... that's what he saw. And it was because, well, he was... my opinion is he was too goddamn useless to be attractive to anyone. And so that's a hell of a place to be in, you know. And then that's the problem too. If you're chronically rejected by people, it's often because of your own insufficiencies. You know, whether that's cowardice or lack of social skills or whatever it is, it's like... You can't just brush it off as, oh well, you know, no one likes me but really I'm okay. It's like, no, no, wrong. If everyone rejects you, there's probably something wrong. And it's probably deep and difficult and it's going to be horrible to fix.
