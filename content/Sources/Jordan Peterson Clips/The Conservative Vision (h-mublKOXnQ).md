 Conservatives often, when we run campaigns, we often talk about how much we're going to cut and we're gonna reduce taxes. And anybody who relies on a government service, whether it's healthcare or education or post-secondary or children's services or social services, they think, are you cutting the things that I need to be able to survive? And so we have to develop a different philosophy of government. One vision that conservatives can offer, which I think is pretty damn straightforward, is cheap, plentiful, relatively clean energy for everyone. Because everyone, obviously everyone knows if they have an iota of political or economic sense that energy costs drive everything. They drive their transportation, they drive their food costs, they drive their heating costs. And the best thing you can possibly do for poor people over any reasonable span of time is to drive energy costs down to the lowest possible level.
