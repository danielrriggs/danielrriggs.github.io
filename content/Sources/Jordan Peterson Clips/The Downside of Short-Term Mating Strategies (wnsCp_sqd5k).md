 So women rate 80% of men online as below average in attractiveness, whereas men rate 50% of women as below average attractiveness. And so what that means is that the attention of women in an open mating market is focused on a very small percentage of men. And what's happening in colleges and universities where women dominate in terms of proportion of population is that all the women are chasing a very small number of men. So most of the men have no partners at all and some of the men have more partners than they know what to do with. And so those men pursue short-term mating strategies, which is not so good for the women because they just as soon have an actual relationship. But then you might ask, well, what does it do to the man? And that's easy, is that it trains them to adopt antisocial short-term mating strategies. And that's really bad practice because if you practice exploiting people for your momentary gratification, then you'll become an expert at that.
