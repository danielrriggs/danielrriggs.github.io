 The idea is that if you're, if you fall into a chaotic state and everything falls apart There's the possibility that Things can come back together Including what you've just learned In a new state, and so you can conceptualize that symbolically as The existence of the dead father at the bottom of the chaotic landscape That's the proper way, as far as I can tell, to think about it It's like there's something down there that's capable of reforming and re-emerging That incorporates the previous state, but that takes it farther And you're not going to find that unless you descend into this chaotic place Where it feels like all order is gone While you generate order, it's going to be akin to the order that you had before But there's going to be something new about it as well So it's down to the bottom of the chaotic state To bring up what you're missing And that's one level of analysis Another level of analysis, you think, is Well, that's also what you're doing That's what you should be doing In principle, when you're going to university You know, you're You come to university in roughly the same state as Pinocchio You know, you're a bit of a puppet and you're kind of a jackass And what the hell do you know? And it's chaotic because you haven't found your place in the world properly And I don't mean merely for career Not that that's not relevant, because it is But it's more important than that It's because you're a historical creature Because you are a product of history Unless you are enculturated properly Which means you understand That you're a historical creature And you're a historical creature And you're a historical creature Which means you understand Your past In the sense that the humanities can allow for that Then You haven't Being able to incorporate The wisdom of your ancestors Into your day to day pursuits And that's going to make you weak That's the idea anyways And so when you come to university This is what university is for It's so that you can Go into the chaos Pull something out of it that's truly of value And you can incorporate that In your own personality And that makes you much much stronger Like literally stronger Not more educated It's not like you know more facts It's that you literally are a better person And better means You can do far more things That's something that's of crucial importance Is that you can articulate yourself properly Which is more useful Than anything else you could possibly manage Like if you guys come out of university Capable of making Coherent arguments And using language properly You're so powerful that it's Ridiculous You always You can lay out a strategy And pursue it successfully And maybe the strategy is actually oriented Towards something good, something that will actually work Work for you and work for other people as well And I don't really understand Why people aren't told this When they come to university Is that your goal is to Make yourself As articulate In writing and thinking and speaking As you possibly can Because that opens the door to everything That you'll want to do in the future No matter what it is The more articulate person Always Rises, always Because They lay out strategies more effectively They lay out The reasons for doing something or for not doing something More particularly They convince people, and properly so That they can grapple with Potentials That lies ahead Effectively And they can defend themselves when they're challenged And so All of that is Going into the past Into the chaos of the past, you could even say And pulling up the spirit That inhabits that from the bottom And uniting with it And if you don't do that, well You're defenseless in the case of In the face of The tragedy of life And then That's not so good because if you're defenseless In the face of the tragedy of life Then you get way more hurt Than you would otherwise get, and so do the people around you And then the probability that you're going to be Resentful and bitter about that Is really high because No one likes to fail continually And then you get Bitter and resentful And then once you're bitter and resentful Well, being vengeful and mean Is the next step It doesn't take much of a transformation to move you from That place to the next So now Pinocchio Has to Face the thing that he's afraid of Most, and that's a complicated Idea as well So Jung had this Phrase that he liked That he took from the alchemists Which was Instur Quillinus Invinatur And what it meant was What you most want to find will be found Where you least want to look There's this old story It's from King Arthur, and King Arthur has these knights Right? They all sit around a round table Which means they're roughly equal That's what the round table means And they're off to find the Holy Grail, and the Holy Grail is the most Valuable object, that's what it means So they're off to find the most valuable thing But they don't know what it is, and they don't know where it is But they know that there's a most valuable thing So in some sense it's akin to them Orienting themselves by the star And they don't know Where to look, and so what they decide Is They have the castle in the middle of a forest And so each knight decides to start Looking for the Holy Grail By entering the forest at the point that looks darkest to him And so what's the idea there? Well imagine there are things that come easy to you And that you're fond of pursuing And that you're happy about pursuing So you've found those and pursued them And you've mastered them So you know all that, but then there's another place That you don't want to go And so you haven't gone there And you haven't mastered it And you're very small in comparison to it Because you haven't mastered it And you're very small in comparison to it And you're very small in comparison to it Because you haven't mastered it And so it has this monstrous aspect But it has If what you're working If what you're doing isn't working It's where you haven't gone That you need to go And so I can give you another example of this So let's say You're an agreeable person And so you don't like conflict And you won't stand up for yourself And you regard anger and the proclivity To provoke and to engage in conflict As something that's positively terrible It's not only that you're not good at it It's actually that it's wrong So that's where you have to go If you're going to learn how to stand up for yourself And imagine that you're afraid Maybe you have something like agoraphobia So there's a whole bunch of things that you're afraid of And you don't want to go there But if you want to put yourself together Then that's exactly where you have to go And so it's frequently the case that What you want to do Is to be found where you least want to find it And that idea is echoed in the Prominent stories of dragons and gold It's exactly the same idea Is that the dragon is this terrible thing It's this terrible predatory thing that lives forever And is very very wise And it lives underground And it'll kill you, it'll burn you up in a second But it hoards gold And so you have to go And you have to go And you have to go And you have to go And you have to go And you have to go And you have to go And you have to go And you have to go And you have to go And you have to go And you have to go And you have to go And you have to go And you have to go And you have to go And you have to go And you have to go So you don't get one without the other You don't get the gold without the dragon That's a very strange Very very strange idea But it seems to be Accurate
