 Many 19 year old girls, I've talked to many of them, believe that their career is going to be the most important thing in their life. Very few 30 year old women believe that, even if they have high powered careers. Because they tend to discover that high powered careers come at a substantial cost, like 60, 70 hour work weeks, etc. And so that life might be best spent in the bosom of family and friends and with children, etc. That's where much of the true value is. And most women figure that out by the time they're in their 30s, which is why high powered law firms, for example, have a hell of a time retaining their extremely competent and highly valuable women. No one likes to talk about this. They wouldn't talk about it in the law firms that I consulted for. Many, many of them, all the women would talk about it privately. The discussion was always about how the law firms weren't doing enough to support women with their children. And all the women knew that wasn't true. That wasn't what was going on. The law firms were bending over backwards to try to accommodate them because they wanted to keep their high performing women for obvious economic reasons.
