 You hear now and then, undergraduates, they say, well, I just write what the professor wants to hear, and then I get a good grade. First of all, most professors aren't that corrupt. You have to be pretty damn corrupt before you go that far, before a student will hand you something that's well crafted and well thought through, and you'll actually punish them for it. You've gone way off the malevolent end of the academic spectrum when you do that. Now, you know, maybe you're a bit biased and you'll give them a B plus instead of an A, and it's not like that's particularly forgivable, but it's not a catastrophe. So I think it's a bit cynical on the part of the undergraduates, usually, but more importantly, it's like, what are you going to do? You're going to do your whole four-year degree and all you're going to do is write what you think your professors want to hear, and you think you're going to come out educated? It's like, no, you're not, because you've rewritten a different self and you've practiced deceit with regards to your highest moral faculty, right, your capacity for articulated speech. You've practiced that for four years.
