 I've talked to my daughter a lot about this. My daughter runs my companies. My daughter didn't know much about business when she started and she was pretty sick too. And she didn't know a lot. And so it was easy for people who thought they knew a lot about business to pull the wool over her eyes. But Michaela has the ability to ask stupid questions. And we've talked about that a lot. It's like, you only have to ask a stupid question once. If you're alert, you ask a stupid question. And if you're in a crowd and you ask a stupid question, 80% of the people in the crowd have the same question. They're just too cowardly to ask. But you ask and then someone actually tells you, you never have to ask that question again. You're no longer stupid. So if you ask enough stupid questions because you're honest, well then you're not stupid anymore.
