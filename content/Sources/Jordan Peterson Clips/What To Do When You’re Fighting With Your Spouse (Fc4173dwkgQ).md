 And when you get trapped into a fight like that, you get tempted to try to win. Like, no, this time for sure you're wrong. Then you want to make your point. And that's not great strategy because probably you're not 100% right. And beside that, even if you do win, you're stuck with your partner the next day. If you win all the time, then you have a loser for a partner. And then you don't win unless you think that you can be a winner with a loser for a partner. And so defeating your partner is not a very good strategy. Most people aren't that easy to defeat. So even if you do win in some sense and you defeat them, they're looking for the opportunity to return the favour. And it'll probably make itself manifest sooner rather than later. What you want to do in the course of a marital dispute is make peace.
