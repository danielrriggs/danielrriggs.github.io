 I don't think one can honestly look at life and deny free will. I think a lot of people can reason their way out of believing, but if there is a supercomputer which could somehow measure all of the vibrations from every photon and every electron since the Big Bang and crunch it all up, could it figure out that I'm gonna clap my hands right now on this podcast? Well, if there is such a supercomputer, that computer is God, which speaks to the fact that there is both an experiential free will and there is something beyond free will as well. That in some ways I'm responsible for my choices and in some ways I'm not. From a governing point of view, from a justice point of view, we can only organize society around the idea of free will. You couldn't organize society around determinism. It would be an unjust society.
