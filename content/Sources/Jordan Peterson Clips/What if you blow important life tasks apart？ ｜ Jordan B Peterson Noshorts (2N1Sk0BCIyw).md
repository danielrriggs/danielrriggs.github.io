 the trans kids that came after me in the first demonstration against me, I said, you think I'm your enemy, but I'm not. And the reason I said that being a clinician was because I thought, well, you're adopting an identity that there is no rules for. What the hell are you going to do with that? You're inviting so much trouble into your life. You can't even possibly imagine it because you won't know what to do and people won't know how to treat you. And so where does that leave you? Now, you might say, well, I'm so distraught about my the discordance between my psychological state and my biological reality that that pales in comparison. And maybe there are situations where that's the case, but man, an identity that doesn't solve the problem of how you're going to live isn't an identity. I don't know what it is, but it's not an identity.
