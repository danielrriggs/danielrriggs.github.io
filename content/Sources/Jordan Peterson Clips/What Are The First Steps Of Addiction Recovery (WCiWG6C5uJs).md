 The first step is acknowledging that you are powerless over your addiction and that your life has become unmanageable. Just admitting, I don't want to be in this situation. There's two parts to that admission. One is that you're in trouble. Yeah. And I guess there's three. You're in trouble and it's serious. Things could be better and you don't have the wherewithal at the moment to make them better. So the thing that's interesting about that is there's a kind of radical humiliation and humility that goes along with that. You say, I have a problem and what I know at the moment isn't sufficient to solve it. Great, because now you've opened yourself up to the possibility of learning something. Yes. I don't know enough to fix this. It's like, okay, well you could learn. And one of the things that's so interesting about people is that if they decide they have a problem and they also notice that they could learn, the probability that they will learn goes way up.
