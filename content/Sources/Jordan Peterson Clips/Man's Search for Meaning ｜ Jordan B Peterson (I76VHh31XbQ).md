 If you could recommend one book to everybody and you can't say your own 12 rules for life, which one would you recommend? Man's Search for Meaning is pretty good, Viktor Frankl. Man's Search for Meaning. It's good. It's not very long. It's pretty accessible. It's deep. And it's fundamentally accurate, I would say. It's a profound book. And everyone can read it, I think. What is it about? The person who wrote it, Viktor Frankl, was a psychiatrist who spent time in Auschwitz. And so it's a discussion about totalitarianism and meaning and personal responsibility. And it's brilliant. Very profound, meaningful, serious, uplifting book, even though it's very, very dark. It's a great book. It's been a bestselling book for decades because of that.
