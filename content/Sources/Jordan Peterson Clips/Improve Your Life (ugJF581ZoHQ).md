 One of the things you might ask yourself is, how do I improve my life? And one answer would be, well, are there things that you know you need to do that you're avoiding? And the answer to that is almost invariably, yes. And then the pathway to your redemption would be, well, you have to start doing those things. And you might say, well, I can't because I'm too afraid. And then a behavioral psychologist would say, well, then just break the thing that you're afraid of down into smaller pieces until you can find a piece that's small enough so you'll do it, and then start doing that. And you might think, well, that's a pretty little thing that I have to do to move forward. And the proper response to that is, it doesn't really matter if it's a little thing. What matters is that you confront something that you're afraid of voluntarily.
