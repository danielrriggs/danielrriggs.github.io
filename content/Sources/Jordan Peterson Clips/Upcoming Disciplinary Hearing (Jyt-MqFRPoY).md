 Now they have to drag me in front of a disciplinary hearing, which I will make unbelievably public. And then because I won't move in that regard, as far as I can tell, I don't see that they have a leg to stand on. You know, not only am I being accused in the vast majority of the accusations of having unacceptable political beliefs, but half the people who complained claim they were clients of mine. So procedurally, this is also a nightmare for them, as far as I can tell, because at minimum, they should have inquired in relationship to these claims that the complainants were clients of mine. They should have noted to them that they weren't, and they should have required them to reinitiate the complaint process without falsehood. And they didn't do any of that repeatedly.
