 There is no metric that is more highly associated with living a long life purely based on length of life. There's no metric anywhere in the medical literature that's more highly correlated with this than having a high VO2 max. VO2 max is a measure of your peak cardiorespiratory fitness. But the second most highly correlated metric of length of life is a composite metric of strength and muscle mass. People always ask me, why is it so important? I think it's important because those things are remarkable integral functions. VO2 max isn't just a number. Do you want to define integral? Oh yeah, yeah. They basically tell you, they add up the work that has been done to that point. So you don't just have a VO2 max because you woke up one day and decided to do something positive. You have a high VO2 max because you've been training very hard for a long period of time, in many cases for years.
