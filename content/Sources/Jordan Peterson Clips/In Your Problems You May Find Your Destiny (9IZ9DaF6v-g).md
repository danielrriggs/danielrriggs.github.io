 People have problems and they're often annoyed and oppressed by the fact they have problems. But first of all, you don't have all the problems in the world. You have your problems and the problems that bother you. And you might ask yourself, well, why do those problems bother you and not other problems? And I would say, maybe it's because in those problems, you actually find your destiny. And those are often things you don't wanna look at, like you didn't wanna look at the poverty of your continent and no bloody wonder who wants to look at that. But it was something that bothered you. It turned out that was your problem. And if you faced it, well, then you figured out on that road that that was your destiny properly thinking.
