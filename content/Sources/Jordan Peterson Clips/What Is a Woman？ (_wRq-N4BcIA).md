 With the advent of hypothetically 100% reliable birth control, the question of what is a woman actually becomes a real question. Because a woman who has voluntary control over her reproductive function is not the same creature as a woman who doesn't, and not even a little bit. If sex is no longer tied to reproduction, then in principle, women's sexual behavior can become equivalent to men's sexual behavior, because the risk is now the same. If women are acting like men sexually, then why aren't they men? How are they different? If sex is no longer tied to reproduction tightly, and women are free from involuntary child rearing and bearing, then how are they different from men in the broader labor market and with regards to general productivity? And the answer is, we have absolutely no idea.
