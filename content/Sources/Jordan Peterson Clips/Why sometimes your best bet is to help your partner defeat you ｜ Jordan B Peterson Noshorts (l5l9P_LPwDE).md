 You know if you win an argument you think well, I'm right because I won the argument I can tell you that's not gonna go very far in your marriage so one of the things I learned in my marriage and It was the same on my wife's part Sometimes your best bet is to help your partner make the best argument they can to defeat you Because just because you can win the argument doesn't mean you're right It might be that your partner has got a handle on something. They can't articulate it very well But their intuitions their ability to detect patterns is is spot-on and you can crush them verbally Let's say or using other techniques at your disposal whatever they might be And you think well, you know, I proved my point Yeah, fair enough perhaps, but if your wife isn't on board Well, good luck for you and just because you proved your point doesn't mean the world is going to accept that conclusion
