 So many of us are aimless. It's like we're away and we're like, why do I feel aimless? People ask me that all the time like man, I feel so aimless. I don't know what to do. Well, okay. So two things happen when you're aimless. Okay, so the first is you get anxious and the reason you get anxious is because anxiety computes aimlessness. If you drop someone in the middle of the desert, the reason they're anxious is because It's not because they don't know which way to go. It's because there are way too many places to go And that's aimlessness is like every direction beckons That's way too complicated and your brain literally signals that with anxiety aimlessness and anxiety are the same thing But it's worse your brain is set up to produce positive emotion literally This is what the positive motion system does it computes decrease between you and a goal So if you have a goal and you see that you've done something that moves you towards it Your brain produces a dopamine hit and that makes you feel good and it strengthens the neural circuits that moved you forward It does both of those that's reward and reinforcement And what that means is if you don't have a goal you have no positive emotion
