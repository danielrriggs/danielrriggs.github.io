 There's way more fat poor people than starving for poor people. Right, that's a hell of a fine accomplishment. And I don't mean that as a joke, right? I mean, the only starvation there is in the world now is for political reasons. We can easily feed the entire population and more than that. We're going to peak at about nine billion and the population is going to come down after that. And that's not going to be very long in the future. And the declining population is going to be the problem, not the increasing population. The planet is rapidly greening. That's a consequence of carbon dioxide production, which I think is insanely comical. It's mostly happening in semi-arid areas, which is exactly the opposite of what we've been told for the last 30 years. And the data on that are crystal clear. And it turns out that's because when plants have more carbon dioxide, they can close their breathing pores. And that means they can inhabit drier areas and so the desert shrink, not grow. So that's some positive about that.
