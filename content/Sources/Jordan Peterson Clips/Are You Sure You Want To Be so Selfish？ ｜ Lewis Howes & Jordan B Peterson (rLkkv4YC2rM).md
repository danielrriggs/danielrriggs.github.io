 Let's say that you want to be selfish. You think that's the best possible strategy. Why should I care about others? Okay. Let's say you should only act in your own best interest. Well, then it's like, well, what's your best interest? Well, what does interest mean? And what does you mean? Your best interest, three mysteries. What's your, what's best, what's interest? Well, there's you, but you aren't just you right now. You're you and you tomorrow and you next week and you next month and you in five years and you in 10 years and you, when you're a pensioner, you're a community of selves stretched across time. And so if you were enlightened and selfish, you would act in a manner that would benefit that entire community across time. And I don't think that's any different than acting on the best possible part for other people.
