 We grow very efficient food so that in rich countries, at least in countries that have sufficient resources to actually care about other things than just surviving, they set aside more and more nature. That's why, just in Denmark where I am right now, we used to have about a third of the country covered in forest, then we cut about all of it down. So we're down to about 2%. Now we're back up to 14%. Why? Because we're rich. We actually like and we plant forests so that we have places to take our kids out and watch it. And so again, the point here is it's not just optimism, it's actually realism to recognize that you're only going to fix the problem by looking at the data, finding out what are the challenges, fix many of these challenges and realizing you can't fix everything or at least not everything at once.
