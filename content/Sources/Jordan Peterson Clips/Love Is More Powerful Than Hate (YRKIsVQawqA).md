 Truth is more powerful than deceit by a large margin. And I think love is more powerful than hate by a large margin. I don't mean naive love, and I'm not naive about people. But I think it is possible for us to rise above the resentment of our suffering and to wish the best for all things. And I think we can participate in that. And you do that by extending your hand to your enemy to the degree you're capable of doing that. And then truth, well, that's the handmaiden of love. And that's something everyone can practice at every moment if they desire that. And that's an adventure. If you're acting deceitfully, you already specify the outcomes of your action. And you pursue that. But the problem with that is it's predicated on the acceptance of your own authoritarian completeness. So what do you do instead? You just do your best to not lie and see what happens. And what happens are wonderful things.
