 When you think about the future, what you're doing is generating a multiplicity of potential environments and then you're generating a sequence of avatars of yourself to live in those fictional futures and then you watch what happens as that avatar lives in each of those fictional futures and if the avatar fails, you don't act that out It's bloody brilliant, it's brilliant That's what our brain does, it's like it hypothesizes potential futures It runs simulations and it kills them And that can be really painful, but it beats the hell out of dying yourself or maybe sometimes you won't think so, because it really can be painful But it's something that as far as we know, only human beings can really do, right? We invent possible futures and invent possible future selves and kill them off in our imagination
