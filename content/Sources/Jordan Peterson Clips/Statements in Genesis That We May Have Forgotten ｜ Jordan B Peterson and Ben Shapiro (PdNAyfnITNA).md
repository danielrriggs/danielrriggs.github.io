 I think there's two statements in the in Genesis that are of equivalent importance actually One of them maybe there's three one of them is that what God used to create order out of Potential and chaos was something approximating a process that was characterized by truth and courage And so there's a there's an idea there Which is why I think God continually repeats after he creates day after day that the creation was good And so the idea is that if you face the potential of the world Which is I think something that human beings do with their consciousness I think that's what consciousness is for if you face the world with truth and courage Then what you generate out of that field of possibilities is in fact good Even though the price you may pay a price for the truth in the short term it's an act of faith even in some sense which reflects that axiomatic presupposition that there's nothing that's going to improve the world more than forthright confrontation with the structure of reality and an attempt to abide by the truth and Then you have that second statement, which is a miraculous statement. I believe it's hard to see it as as anything else That both men and women are made in the image of God We've already had God established as the creator and the creator who creates in a certain ethical manner and then that power or ability or virtue or privilege or Responsibility is transferred to human beings and it's transferred to men and women and I also find that actually quite stunning you know because There's no shortage of postmodern Feminist criticism of the Judeo-Christian tradition claiming that it's fundamentally oppressive and patriarchal and yet right at the beginning you have this Incredible statement which which seems to fly in the face of its of the anachronistic nature of the document Stating that it's not just men that are made in the image of God It's men and women and that's and that's it isn't obvious to me How that conclusion was reached so long ago
