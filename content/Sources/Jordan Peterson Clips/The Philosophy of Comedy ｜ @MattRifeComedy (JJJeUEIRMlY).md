 So Freud regarded jokes as a route to the unconscious, like as part of the royal road to the unconscious. Well, the reason for that is that you don't get to decide whether you're going to laugh if it's a genuine laugh. If someone says something that's funny, you'll laugh, even if you're embarrassed about laughing afterwards, right? So the funniest jokes are actually the ones where you laugh despite yourself. Yeah, of course. Right, right. But what that shows is that when you tell a good joke, you're striking someone very rapidly and very hard in a part of their being that can't be faked. So there's something dreadfully honest about comedy because you can't, no one laughs at a joke with a real laugh and you can tell if it's a real laugh, unless the joke is actually funny.
