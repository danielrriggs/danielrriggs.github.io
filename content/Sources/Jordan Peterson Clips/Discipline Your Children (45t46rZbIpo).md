 You should discipline your children when they're disgracing themselves. And the reason you should do that isn't because they're bad kids, or because it reflects badly on you, or because you're angry, but because if they continue to act that way, other people aren't going to want to have them around. And that's not good for your kids, so you discipline them. So I say to my son, for example, go sit on the steps till you can act like a civilized human being, or whatever terminology is appropriate when he's young. And the rule was, well, as soon as you get yourself under control, problem solved. Well, it's the same with past sins, so to speak, is if you failed to hit the target properly, but you figured out why, and now you know how you would chart your course differently in the future, done.
