 Why would you have children? It's like, that's a stupid question. It's like, well, what else are you going to do? You know, I mean, there aren't that many things that make up your life. And intimate relationships, that's 20% of your life, or 30% of your life. Children, that's 20% of your life. Now, you can get away with neither of those, but you better have a walloping career, or a tremendous aptitude at something creative and remarkable. And maybe you can do that, maybe that'll be enough for you, but I've seen that unidimensionality work out well, very, very, very, very, very rarely. And you have children because you won't have, you'll never have the opportunity in your life to have as high quality a relationship with anyone as you could potentially have with your child. So you're going to forgo that? Well, you can, but what's left for you then?
