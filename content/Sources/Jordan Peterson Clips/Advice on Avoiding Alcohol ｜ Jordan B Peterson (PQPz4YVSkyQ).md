 Any tips on avoiding booze Yeah, that's a real tough one. Well, I would say a couple of things There is a drug if you're a binge drinker There is a drug called naltrexone that you could consider and you take naltrexone every day It doesn't really have any psychological effect on you But if you're a naltrexone responder, what will happen is that it will dampen your positive response to alcohol So some people who are alcoholic many of them have a very pronounced opiate an Opiate effect from alcohol. It looks like it's mediated by beta endorphin and naltrexone is an opiate blocker and so What naltrexone seems to do is dampen the positive response and the positive response which would be opiate and then dopaminergic Is the same response that makes you want to keep drinking when you start drinking? So if you're one of those people that has a drink and then has to have another one then has to have another one And you know soon all your money's gone Then the probability that you have an opiate response is pretty high and naltrexone can help with that Generally when people take naltrexone they keep drinking they try to control but they keep drinking and they learn over time that the alcohol Doesn't have the same punch. It's still pleasant, but doesn't have the same overwhelming punch that it did at one point So that would be one suggestion and it's worth trying The other is like make a plan. I would say do the future autism program You know because it isn't that you're trying to avoid booze exactly It's that you're trying to restructure your whole life, you know because if you're a drinker then all your friends are drinkers and and You're used to drinking in every social situation and the places that you go to socialize or places that you drink and Like it's really built in as a whole set of habits and so what you have to do is Kind of redesign your life and you have to think of things You can't just stop drinking you have to figure out what you're going to start doing instead of drinking there's a hole that you have to fill and you know the future authoring program will also help you figure out what your life could look like in the absence of alcohol and And What kind of hell you could end up in if you keep drinking it and it causes all the problems that it can cause and I think you really need to Like you need to think through the hell that can occur and you have to think through how your life could be valuable without alcohol so that you can be motivated enough to To try to to regulate it and I would also say if you fail and slip Don't berate yourself and beat yourself up just start quitting again because you know if you can cut your alcohol Intake down 75 percent. That's a hell of a lot better than zero and Often people go all or nothing just like they do when they're quitting cigarettes And you know they'll quit for a month and then have a cigarette and say oh my god Now I'm now I've broken the pact and then they'll smoke all packed and they'll be smoking again You don't have to do that you can just decide that you slipped and that you're gonna get back on the wagon again And you know it can take a long time But I do believe that you need a better vision of life, right? you have to find something to do that's better than alcohol and that might take some real consideration, especially if alcohol is a Very potent drug for you. And I would also say don't hesitate to try the naltrexol It's got a pretty decent clinical history and it's it's basically harmless so
