 Liberalism isn't the consequence of wealth, it's the precondition for wealth. You can think about that particularly with regards to such things as the right to private property and the right to the fruits of your own labor. If your society isn't predicated on the idea that the individual is somehow intrinsically worthwhile and sovereign in that manner that's not merely a gift of the state, but something intrinsic to the person, soon as you have that, you have, at least in principle, an inviolable right to something approximating private property and to the fruits of your own labor. And without that fundamental presumption, which I think most particularly is a Judeo-Christian biblical presumption, the whole capitalist enterprise, and it's because it's so reliant on trust and honesty as well, for example, to really flourish and on the right of private property, it's just a non-starter. This is a favorite shibboleth of the West, is that while we can have all this economic prosperity or even more of it with a centralized top-down control system that's predicated on the idea of equality, but in reality, that never seems to pan out.
