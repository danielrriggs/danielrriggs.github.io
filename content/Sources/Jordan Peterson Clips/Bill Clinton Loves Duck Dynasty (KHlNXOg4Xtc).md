 I was talking to Bill Clinton one time, and I understood why these guys can become president. Because he puts his hand on my shoulder, and he said, I love Duck Dynasty. And for whatever reason, I said, you don't watch Duck Dynasty. I don't know why I took that aggressive, opposite approach to him. And he looks at me and he goes, you want to know why that show worked? And I was like, yeah, I would love to know why Bill Clinton thought this show worked. And the answer he gave was not just the best political answer ever, because he covered every deal. He said, because it was real. And he's looking at me, he said, it's real. And I was thinking to myself, and I went, but if it wasn't real, we thought it was real. And so I was like, there you go. So he was like, that's why we bought into it. And if it wasn't, you fooled us.
