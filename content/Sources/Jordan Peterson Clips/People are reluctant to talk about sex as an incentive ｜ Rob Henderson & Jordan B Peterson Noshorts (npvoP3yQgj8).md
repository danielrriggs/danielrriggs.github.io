 People are so just reluctant to talk about the importance of sex as an incentive. I mean, there's a lot of discussion in society, for example, about economic incentives, about jobs, professions, but there's not much talk about the role that sex plays. I mean, from the sort of evolutionary perspective, sex has been around since before we were human. Sex is still going to be around long after humans have gone extinct. Like sex is universal. It's what drives every single species. I'm just surprised at how often we overlook it as an incentive for behavior and how fast things are changing in the realm of sex. From 2008 to 2018, the amount of sexlessness among men under the age of 30 has doubled. And for women, it increased slightly, but for men, it has doubled to the point where about one in three young men are reporting that they haven't had sex in the past year, which is a very new thing. Despite the mating apps. Right. Despite the apps, despite even more support for sexual freedom and for polyamory and novel relationship arrangements.
