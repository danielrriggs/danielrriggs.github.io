 we met another North Korean fellow defector and then she told me there was way out of all this, which means going to South Korea and then they say I told them what do you mean South Korea? I thought South Korea was colonized by America. It's like the horrible, horrible, capitalistic country and she was like no, South Korea is free and that is I remember still the time I learned the word free that day. I was asking her what do you mean I'm gonna be free in South Korea and she of course did not know freedom meant freedom of speech. None of that. She literally told me oh in South Korea you can wear jeans and you can watch TV and no one's gonna be arresting you for that and that's how we conceived freedom as North Koreans. Like freedom meant wearing jeans.
