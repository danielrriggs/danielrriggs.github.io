 It's unpopular children who say, oh, well, the game is only going to be the one I want to play. And those children, other children just move away from there. They alienate and isolate them instantly, and they go look for other play partners. Those kids are no fun. And it's because they're too insistent that their subjective state dominate the social space. And that's exactly what's happening on the identity politics front. It's like, well, I feel I'm this way, and you better treat me like that or else. It's like, you are a bad little kid. You're a kid that never learned how to play, and you're being fostered in your juvenile delusion by your narcissistic, virtue signaling parents who aren't sensible enough to help you guide yourself towards the establishment of an identity that would allow you to be appreciated by other children.
