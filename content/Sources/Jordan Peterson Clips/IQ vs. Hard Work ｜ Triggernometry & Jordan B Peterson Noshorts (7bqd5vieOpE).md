 If you look at what predicts people's success across time, the best predictor is IQ. This is where psychology is actually reliable as a science. And that accounts for about 25% of the differences in outcome between people. So a lot's left unexplained, right? 75%. But 25% is a lot. The next best predictor is conscientiousness. And it accounts for about 5% to 9%. Which again, leaves a lot unexplained, but it's not nothing. And then the third one is how sensitive you are to negative emotion. And it accounts for something like 3% to 4%. So it is definitely the case that if you took two people that are equal in some valuable domain, the one that works harder is going to do better, and that might even compound over time. But if you take two people of radically different IQ, and they both work equally hard, the person with the higher IQ is going to crush the person with the lower IQ.
