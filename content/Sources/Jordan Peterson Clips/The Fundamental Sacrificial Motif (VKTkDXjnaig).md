 What are you willing to sacrifice in order to move forward? You have to give up something that you love, and you may have to give up the thing you love the best. That's the fundamental sacrificial motif. Sacrifice is an unattractive idea in our self, in our society that's based on consuming and indulgence. And this is not something that I would lay, so this is again perhaps you and I somewhat differ, is that I would not, whilst this will not change without the individual's engagement, a kind of step one, an acknowledgement that needs to be changed. This is where I say there is a social responsibility for whatever reason our society has become a manifestation of these darker impulses. These are the prevalent forces, at least in the kind of society I live in. I don't know what it's like to live in China or Libya. I'm just saying like in London, like what you're hit with. Too much emphasis on immediate gratification. Too much emphasis on, because immediate gratification is a tool of consumerism.
