 One of the things that's true of the biblical stories is because they are hyperlinked with other stories in the biblical corpus. So almost all their plot lines and characterizations reflect many other plot lines and characterizations. And so you can delve into them and never stop. And part of the consequence of that is that if you have an apprehension of one of the stories and you can see how it echoes with all the other things that it includes, it does have that deep rearranging effect. So one of the things that deep literature does is it brings you into harmony with the spirit of the literature. And that's akin to that idea that Christ was brought into harmony with the spirit of the law and the prophets. And partly as a consequence of being educated in the tradition.
