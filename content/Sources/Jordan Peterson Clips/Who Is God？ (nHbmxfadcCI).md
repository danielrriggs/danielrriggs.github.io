 Who is God then? Let's try to sneak up to this question if it's at all possible. Is it possible to even talk about this? Well, it better be, because otherwise there's no communicating about it, right? It has to be something that can be brought down to earth. Well, we might be too dumb to bring it down. It's not just ignorant, it's also sinful, right? So, because there's not knowing and then there's wanting to know or refusing to know. Yeah. And so you might say, well, could you extract God from a description of the objective world, right? Is God just the ultimate unity of the natural reality? And I would say, well, in a sense, there's some truth in that, but not exactly, because God in the highest sense is the spirit that you must emulate in order to thrive.
