 There's a very large amount that we don't know about the structure of experience that we don't know about reality. And we have our articulated representations of the world. And then you can think of outside of that there are things we know absolutely nothing about. And there's a buffer between them. And those are things we sort of know something about. And we don't know them in an articulated way. Here's an example, you know, sometimes you're arguing with one of your... someone close to you and they're in a bad mood, you know. They're being touchy and unreasonable and you keep the conversation up and maybe all of a sudden they, you know, they get angry. Maybe they cry. And then when they cry they figure out what they're angry about. And it has nothing to do with you, even though you might have been what precipitated the argument. That's an interesting phenomena as far as I'm concerned. Because it means that people can know things at one level without being able to speak what they know at another. In some sense the thoughts rise up from the body. And they do that in moods and they do that in images and they do that in actions. And we have all sorts of ways that we understand before we understand in a fully articulated manner.
