 Every hierarchical system tends to degenerate in the direction of power and all hierarchical systems are less than they could be and that's partly because of the possibility that power and deceit will corrupt them but also partly because we're willfully blind and deceitful in our own personal lives. And so when you tell young people that the cause of the trouble they see around them in the world and maybe even the disquiet in their own heart is the malevolent inadequacy of their society. That rings true and they don't hear the rest of the story that I've been trying to tell that yeah don't forget about the evil and corruption that exists in your own heart and don't forget about the fact that wonderful goddess nature is also trying to make you ill and kill you at all times.
