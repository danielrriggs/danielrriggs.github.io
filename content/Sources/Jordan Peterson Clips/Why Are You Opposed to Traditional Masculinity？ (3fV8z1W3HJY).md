 Why are you opposed to traditional masculinity? Well, it's because it's oppressive. It's like, yeah, maybe, maybe it's because if you accepted the doctrines of discipline, you wouldn't be able to gratify every goddamn whim that entered your mind the second it entered your mind. And then that's the definition of self that's emerged among the radicals. I am what I am, which is by the way, what God says to Moses, I am what I am moment to moment. And why do you have no right to interfere with that? Because I want to be allowed to do whatever the hell I want to whoever I want at any given moment. Like with no thought whatsoever, even for my own preservation. You know, and I think we see that celebrated. We see that ethos celebrated in Pride season. And it's not fluke that it's called Pride season.
