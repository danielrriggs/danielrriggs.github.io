 my mom being raped in front of me. And you said that your mother offered herself as an alternative to you and you were 13 at the time. And that was your first introduction to sex of any sort because there was no sexual education or contact for young people. I don't imagine you even understood what was happening. No, I go there and I was like something 60 pounds, so small. And this man was like, I want to have sex with her. And my mom's like, what do you mean? Like she's only child. Just take me instead. And he was raping her in front of me, seeing something so horrible that I didn't want to see. And after that, they took us to this house where they would literally make us stand up, make us turn around, take our teeth and everything and making price on our body. I was a virgin, so my price would be less than $300. And my mom's price was less than $100. That's how little human being worth right now in this 21st century.
