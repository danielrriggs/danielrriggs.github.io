 There's a reason in our legal system that we start with the presumption of innocence, which is a miracle. Tyrannies start with the presumption of guilt. And the reason they do that is because everyone's done something wrong. And if you dig around enough in anyone's life, you'll find a reason that they're culpable. The fact that we presume innocence is a complete bloody miracle. And I can't figure out how we ever managed to get that right. But you've got to do that with yourself. So imagine you're taking yourself to task because you did some things wrong. It's like, OK, list them out in your imagination or write it down. But then you've got to defend yourself as thoroughly as you possibly can. Doesn't mean you're trying to get yourself off the hook. It means that you're trying not to take yourself apart more than is necessary. The precondition for forgiving yourself is, first of all, to sort out whether or not you're accusing yourself too viciously. But then let's assume that there's some leftover, compelling evidence that you did do something wrong. OK, now you have to figure out what you did wrong. And you have to figure out what you would have done differently and what you will do differently in the future.
