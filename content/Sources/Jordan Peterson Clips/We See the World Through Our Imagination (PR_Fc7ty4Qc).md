 Think about the constellations and the names of the constellations and the idea that the skies were populated by gods, you know. That was an externalization of our imagination, right? Projected out into the world. We were seeing the world through our imagination. And which is exactly how we do see the world. And as we proceed, we're better able to distinguish, let's say, what's imagination from what's objective world. But that doesn't mean the imagination disappears or that it's without value. Because the imagination is part of what helps us, let's say, confront the future, because we do that with our imagination. And to compose things in possibility before we realize them in actuality. So for Jung, the world of gods just collapsed within, back into the imagination. And it was into the imagination that we had to go again to discover what we had lost. To discover these lost values.
