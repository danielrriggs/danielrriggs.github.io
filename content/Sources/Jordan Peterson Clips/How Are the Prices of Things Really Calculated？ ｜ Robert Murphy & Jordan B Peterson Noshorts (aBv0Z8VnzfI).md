 Imagine you're a carpenter and you want to build a house, but you don't have a ruler. You don't have any way to measure length. So maybe you eyeball it. Maybe you get pretty good at that, but for maybe you can't even do that. So you can't measure length and now you have to build a house. Well, you can't because you have to measure. And so then the fundamental principle here is that money is the measure of value and it's computed as a consequence of a distributed network. And that's the only reason it works. Each person is pursuing something of value in so far as they're capable of doing that. And they make some pricing decisions on the basis of their specialized expertise. And then we sum the consequences of that specialized computation and we have a price for everything or virtually everything. And because we have a price for everything, we can roughly decide what to do.
