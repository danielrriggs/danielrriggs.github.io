 Either I'm wrong or the country is in trouble. Now, to tell you the truth, I would rather be wrong, but I've thought it through. It's like, okay, what did I do exactly? None of my clients complained. That has nothing to do with this. And I express my political opinions, which I have a right to do, which I believe were correct. And Canadians agree with this now. The last poll indicated that Canadians believe that Justin Trudeau is the worst prime minister we've ever had. Well, that was sort of my point a year ago. If I can't say that, and yet a majority of Canadians believe it to be true, and believe me, a lot more are going to believe that in the relatively near future, in what sense do I have anything even approximating freedom of speech? And if I can't have that opinion, and therefore, in principle, no one can, then what do we do when we're stuck with a prime minister, let's say, who everyone has decided is the worst prime minister the country's ever had?
