 Many of you I presume have seen Breaking Bad that's a really good example of the of The incorporation at least in part or maybe the possession by the shadow from the union perspective right because you have this ordinary High school teacher who really thinks that he's an axe and his family as well. You know like your typical Persona roughly speaking. He's just a normal guy But part of the reason that he's a normal guy is because he actually hasn't been put in abnormal Circumstances and then all of a sudden he is and he has a genuine moral conundrum right he's gonna die of lung cancer And his he has a son who's got a lot of health problems And he's terrified that that he's going to leave his wife and his child behind with nothing And then of course has the story and so he decides to do something that temporarily that he regards as what they would normally regard as Reprehensible and of course he just gets tangled up in that but then as the story unfolds you see that there's it's more complicated Because it's not that he was just innocent good guy, and he decided to turn bad He's also very resentful and angry And it's partly because he's a bit of a pushover at the beginning or maybe more than a bit of a pushover And also that he didn't really fulfill his own potential and that you know he had friends who? Walked down the entrepreneurial path and Maybe they weren't quite fair to him But whatever he ends up not very successful as a high school teacher So he's really angry about that and so there's more motivation for him Opening up the door to to the terrible elements of his personality than just the fact that he's got good Motivations to do so and that that unfolds you know and so you see the warps and twists in his resentful character Increasingly manifest themselves as he walks down this road to really total brutality, and it is it's quite good There's a book called ordinary men That's a lot like that. I don't think I've mentioned that to you before but ordinary men is a book about it's the best book of its Type is maybe it's the only book of its type It's possible, but it's plotted much like Breaking Bad in some sense. It's a story about these German policemen in early stages of World War two And they were guys who were old enough to be raised in Germany really before the hitlerian propaganda Came out in full force you know if you were a teenager say in the 1930s you were going to be pulled right into the Propaganda machine and maybe you were part of the hitler youth and like you were raised in that you know but if you were older than you were raised before that and You're not as amenable to propaganda once you're older than about well. I would say about 22 or something like that. It's it's pretty young actually if you're going to make a soldier You have to get a soldier young because once people are in their early 20s say they're kind of they already have their personalities developed anyways these policemen were sent into Poland after the Germans marched through and You know it was wartime, and there was this hypothesis in Germany that The Jews in particular were operating as a fifth column and undermining the German war effort because of course The Germans blamed the Jews and a variety of other people for actually Setting up the conditions that made the war necessary and so when the police were sent into Poland They were also required to make peace Roughly speaking and so they started up by they started out by rounding up all the Jewish men between 18 and 65 and Gathering them in in stadiums and then shipping them off on the trains, but that isn't where they ended They ended in in very very dark place I mean these guys were going out in the field with naked pregnant women and shooting them in the back of the head by the end of their training and What's really interesting about that is that? Is that Their commander told them that they could go home at any time So this is this is not one of those examples of people following orders and the reason they didn't Roughly speaking there's many reasons, but one of the reasons they didn't is because they didn't think it was comradely So to speak to leave there the guys they were working with to do all the dirty work and run off You know and that's really in that's really an interesting fact You know because you'd in different circumstances you wouldn't think about that as reprehensible right you think well That's part of teamwork and under rough circumstances And that's at least in part how they viewed it and they were also made physically ill Multiple times physically and psychologically ill by the things that they had to do, but they kept doing them anyways So it's one step at a time and that's the thing is that you end up in very bad places one step at a time So you've got to watch those steps You
