 Obviously, it's a radically left-leaning organization that's clear watching the interaction between Twitter and Elon Musk. So some of that's formal policy and Twitter's been captured by the woke types. Part of the problem with Twitter is the incentive structure. A social media communication system should have exactly the same rules as face-to-face communication in the real world. Otherwise, it's insane. By definition, if a communication system in a family isn't isomorphic with a communication style that would work in the broader world, the family is insane. It's a definition of insanity. And Twitter is insane.
