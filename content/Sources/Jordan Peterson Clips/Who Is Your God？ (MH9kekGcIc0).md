 Why can't I just do whatever the hell I want whenever the hell I wanna do it with whoever I wanna do it with? And the answer is, because everything goes to hell if you do that, including you. And you say, well, I don't believe in hell. And I say, well, keep acting the way you are and you will. Now everyone with an ounce of sense, an iota of sense, and this is actually what defines sense, knows perfectly well if they only do exactly what they wanna do in accordance with the whim of the moment, which then becomes their God, right? Because if you're motivated by the whim of the moment and you place that above all else, that is now your God. Well, what's the God? Well, in this case, let's say it's sexual motivation. Well, if sexual motivation is your God, you will end up in something indistinguishable from hell. You will misuse other people. You will make them objects of your own narrow and immediate desire. And you'll have no relationships. You'll exploit everyone, including yourself.
