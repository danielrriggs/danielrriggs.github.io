 If you have memories that are more than 18 months old, and those memories come up of their own accord, and they bother you, they still contain emotion, especially negative emotion, there are parts of you, this is one way of thinking about it, there are parts of you that are still trapped in the past that are crying to be released, or there are impediments that you encountered in the past that are still blocking your way, or there are pits that you fell into because of the error of your ways, or because of bad luck, that you're still afraid you might run into again, and the reason those memories come up is because the instincts that drive your negative emotions are trying to warn you of danger, and it's the case that if you allow yourself to dream of those memories again, to let them unfold inside you, you can find your way once again.
