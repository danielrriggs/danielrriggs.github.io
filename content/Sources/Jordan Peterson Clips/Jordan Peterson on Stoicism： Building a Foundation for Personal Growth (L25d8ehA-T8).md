 What is your take on Stoicism? Can this be used as a good foundation for building on? Yeah, well, I don't know that much about Stoicism, you know, I mean, I know that it's a it's an ethic of endurance and willingness to bear responsibility and to make sacrifices and I think part of the reason that there's been somewhat of a movement online in the stoic direction and the resurgence of interest in stoic philosophy is because it's pretty much exactly the opposite of every philosophy you ever hear about anywhere now and So, you know when we when we veer too far in one direction those things we forgot start to glimmer in the Darkness and they attract people that's compensatory So one of the things the psychoanalysts pointed out is that you know, if you're someone wrote me the other day I don't know I answered this question online It's a graduate student and he said he was still having murderous fantasies about people who had humiliated him in high school And he asked me what he asked what he should do about that and I said well You should write out what happened in detail and you should write out your fantasies in detail which is quite frightening and then you should try to see if you can Give the devil is due like the fact that he's having murderous fantasies still Means that there were lessons To be learned embedded in that humiliation that he has not yet integrated and the fantasies are manifesting themselves as a sign of that and If they're analyzed and then integrated the problem would be solved So in all likelihood, well, who knows because I don't know maybe he was smaller Maybe he wasn't as physically intimidating as he needed to be maybe he was afraid Maybe couldn't defend himself verbally.

So you can fix yourself maybe and The the fantasies come up as a compensation. So they're very aggressive and violent it's because he's way too peaceful and meek and so you pull those together and then you're a little meaner than you were and a little more capable of saying no and less likely to Open yourself up to the first forays of bullying. So bullies in high schools, for example They'll go pick on a variety of kids, right just a little prod and some kids will react Too much and then all the bullies just zero in on that kid. Well And then maybe the kid goes home and has fantasies about blowing up the school well the stoicism It's a compensatory fantasy in some sense, you know because everyone's concerned about rights and everyone's concerned about not be about being a victim and and and about being merciful and all of that and That's not enough so a compensation emerges and attracts people to it and so And maybe that'll be helpful to people. So That's that You
