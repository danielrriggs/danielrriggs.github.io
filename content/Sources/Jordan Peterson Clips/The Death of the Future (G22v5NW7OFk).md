 And it's the death of the future itself that you bring about when you interfere with people's ability to destroy the stupidity that would doom them to hell. And that's what you do when you interfere with free speech. It's not a mere matter of, well, you know, people can't just say what they want, as if freedom of speech is some hedonistic whim that we're all allowed to shoot off our mouths merely to gratify our own, what would you say, again, hedonistic desires. It's not surprising that bloody left-wingers think that way because they are perfectly willing to gratify their hedonistic desires at everyone else's expense at any moment in their entire lives. The fact that they'll extend precisely the same logic to the hypothetical hedonism of free speech is absolutely in keeping with the mode of being that they've adopted in the most radical possible manner. But that doesn't mean it's correct.
