 Writing is hard work. It's hard just like thinking but it's not as hard as doing neither because then you're a mess You're anxious and you're and you're without purpose and goal and you're inarticulate and you're weak you lose And I don't mean in this you win and someone else loses matter I mean in an everyone loses manner And so when you sit down to write or think you have to be motivated and if you're not you're not doing it Right, and that's writing teachers should stress that above all else You know They should help their students identify something that they can hardly wait to write about because it's so important to them well, then you've got the motivation and each word starts to matter because Your life depends on it. And if you think your life doesn't depend on your words You just don't know anything about words. This is no game If writing is thinking which it is and thinking sets your life in order or not Then you don't let people mess with your words. You want to get them on order like soldiers
