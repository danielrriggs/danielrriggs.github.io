 You're thinking. So you ask yourself a question, because that's what you do when you're thinking. And then you generate some answers. It's like, it's very strange. The thinking will actually work. You can actually come up with answers if you think about something. And so this issue is, okay, I thought I was real good in my little impulsive paradise, but then it turns out that I'm just a half-wit, and I noticed that, and I want to do something about it. So the question has now been posed, and what Jung would say is, the deeper part of yourself, the part that still contains your undeveloped potential, will respond to that posed question, and change the way that you look at things, and change the way that you act. It'll start changing things, so that you can tap those parts of yourself that are not yet developed.
