 If you read history and you read about what people have done, you think, wow, we're pretty tough. There was a shipwreck in the Antarctica, a hundred years ago or so, and it's not a biography, if I remember correctly, of the captain. They had a shipwreck in the Antarctica. And then they were there for a whole year, in the Antarctica, you know? And none of them died. Not one. He didn't lose a single man. Not one. He kept the morale high. And then they took this boat that was on the ship, and they crossed like 400 miles of the roughest ocean, the roughest frigid ocean in the world. Right? You don't go in that ocean. And then they went to an island, and they walked across the island, across these mountains that no one else has ever climbed since. And they went to the city on the other side of the island, and they got a boat, and they went and rescued their compatriots, and everyone survived. Endurance is the name of the book. You read that book, man, you think, wow, people are really tough, you know? And if, and it's ridiculous, so who knows how tough you are?
