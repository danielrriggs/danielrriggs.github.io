 Biblically speaking, one of the mandates is that for a period of at least one week out of every month, married couples are not supposed to have sex. One of the purposes of that, presumably, would be to create the scarcity and the novelty that you're talking about. Because if you're married, then obviously there's tremendous availability of sex. I mean, contra every single weird public opinion out there, married people tend to have sex significantly more than single people. And it is not particularly close. Theoretically, the scarcity goes away, the novelty goes away, and then so does the romance. And so the Bible literally says... Well, that's a danger anyways. That's a danger. Right. And so the Bible literally says, like, one week out of the month, minimum, you're toast. You can't do anything.
