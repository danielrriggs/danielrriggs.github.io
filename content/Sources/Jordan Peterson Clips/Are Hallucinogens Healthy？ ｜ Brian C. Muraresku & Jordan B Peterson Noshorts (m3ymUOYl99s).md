 I read a large-scale study, hundreds of thousands of people, it's retrospective analysis, looking at the comparative mental and physical health of hallucinogen users versus non-users. And on virtually every measure of physical and mental health, the hallucinogen users were healthier. It's not what you'd expect if it's poison. And so, it's not poison, but it's a chemical that produces this incredibly powerful spiritual experience. What the hell are we supposed to make of that? And it's at the foundation of our religious belief, historically speaking, perhaps at the foundation of Christian ideas themselves. It looks like it's integral to the emergence of Greek rationality in all of the civilization that's flourished in the Mediterranean. It can't just be brushed away. And then there's the clinical evidence coming in from Griffith's end, showing that it does appear to be positively transformative. I mean, it just, it points to something that we just don't understand at all.
