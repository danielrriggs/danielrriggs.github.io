 You asked me what makes a good seal. You gotta be a good shot, of course. You gotta be in good physical condition. All those things are important. You gotta have the skill set. Far and away, what makes a good seal is someone that puts the team before themselves. Jordan, if you're the best shot, you're the fastest, you're the strongest, but you have yourself above the team, I don't want you in my platoon. And no one wants you in the platoon. That's the way it works. Psychologically, if you're focused on yourself, it's gonna cause problems, either the problem of egocentric arrogance or the problem of paranoia. What'd you just use to describe it? I mean, when someone's just focused on themselves. Self-consciousness. When I see people that are self-conscious, you know who notices that you have a zit on your cheek right now? You. No one else cares.
