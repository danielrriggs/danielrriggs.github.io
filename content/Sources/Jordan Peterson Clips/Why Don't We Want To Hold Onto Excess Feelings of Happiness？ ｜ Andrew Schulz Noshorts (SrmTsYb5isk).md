 I did a drug called Molly. What it does is it gives you this super boost of like, I guess it's serotonin or something like that. And it was for the first time in my life. I felt like way excess feelings of happiness, right? Like my jar, my tank was full and then some. When I had that excess, I didn't want to hold it. I literally was calling friends and going, oh my God, I love you. You're the best. This, that, the other. That's what I did with my extra. I didn't store it. I didn't put in a fucking bank vault. I did nothing but give it away. And I was like, wow, that's kind of cool that if I can get myself to full, what I'll do without anybody pushing me is try to get other people to full. That's a hell of a realization. I don't think I'm alone in that. I don't think you are either. I think that's how it is. So does that mean that we're inherently good if we can just get to full? Probably. You know, you had intense enough joy so that you wanted to share it. That's what happened. You didn't want to keep it all for yourself. And there is intense joy in making other people happy.
