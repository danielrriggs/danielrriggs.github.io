 The people who gave birth to our civilization, so to speak, or at least certain aspects of it, regarded this experience with a tremendous amount of respect. They didn't feel it was something antithetical to what they were doing. They felt that it was something that was nourishing what they were doing. Right. Plato calls it the holiest of mysteries in talking about Eleusis. Aristotle says that you go there not to learn something. He uses the Greek word mathÄ“n, like mathematics. You don't go there to learn something, but to experience something. And if you think about philosophy in its broadest sense, Plato himself says that those who engage with philosophy in the right way practice nothing else but dying and being dead. So again, it's this constant sense of death and rebirth. Something fundamentally life-altering happens at Eleusis that convinces these people, convinces these initiates that they have transcended their mortality and they are guaranteed an afterlife. It was said only those who go to Eleusis, only them, will experience the afterlife.
