 Structures do warp and bend and they can tilt towards oppression and tyranny and human structures are susceptible to that But that's a deviation as far as I'm concerned from I would say from the norm But certainly from what's optimal and is it your relationship with between husband and wife is governed by nothing but power that sort of the patriarchal Oppression theory of marriage. It's like well women have always been dominated by men. That's the historical reality It's like really that's your story for the entire corpus of the Cooperation and competition between men and women since the beginning of time. It's essentially domination and nothing else That's how it works is it I don't think there's a bloody shred of evidence for that by the way It looks to me like all the evidence suggests that it's something a lot more akin to reciprocal altruism and honest trade than it is akin to domination by power
