 Just because something can get out of control doesn't mean that it's intrinsically bad. And I would say that's certainly the case about sexual attraction. If your partner is doing things that you find attractive, you might think really hard about rewarding that. And then you may find that you're afraid to reward it because you're afraid of your own urges, or you're afraid that if your partner becomes too attractive, they'll leave you. And then I would say, well, maybe you should up your ante a bit so that they're less inclined to leave you. And maybe you should think through your own sexual morality in more detail and discuss that with your wife so you don't stumble over your own... Um... Very funny. Very funny. Yeah, you filthy-minded creatures. Yeah. Tongue, how's that?
