 The sacrifice that women make especially in relationship to infants is pretty obvious and should be celebrated Which is why the image of the Divine Mother and the infant is a sacred image and any society that doesn't hold that as sacred is Off the rails in some fundamental manner regardless of what anyone says and That's not merely a Christian image by any stretch of the imagination the Egyptians Had images of Isis with Horus on her lap that are clear prefigurations of the images of Mary and Christ of course the society has to worship the mother and the infant because well, obviously if you can't see that Or if you don't want to accept that I don't know what you're rebelling against but it's certainly the spirit of life itself
