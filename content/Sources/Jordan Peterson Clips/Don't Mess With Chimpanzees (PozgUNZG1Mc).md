 chimps are quite patriarchal and You know, you might think well the biggest meanest ugliest chimp wins. He's the king chimp He's the one that gets to father all the baby chimps. Yes and no Yes, because sometimes it is the tyrant that rules the troop but the problem with the tyrant is that two semi tyrants can rip him into shreds and they do with incredible brutality and It and it disturbs the entire troop when that happens But they'll tear off his genitals with their teeth. They'll rip off his skin I mean chimpanzees are super strong like they're about six times as strong as the most well-conditioned man They can break 300 pound test steel cable with their bare hands They are super strong and they have absolutely no restraint whatsoever on their aggression Except the reactions of their conspecifics and so don't mess with chimpanzees
