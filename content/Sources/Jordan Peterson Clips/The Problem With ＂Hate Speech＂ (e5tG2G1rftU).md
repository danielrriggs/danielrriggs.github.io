 Hate speech is ugly, but people hate each other. And if they're not allowed to say that they do, well then their speech is not free. We are losing in C63 the idea of free speech itself. You know that old quote that people always refer to from Voltaire's biographer, the one that goes, I disagree with what you say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say. I think the reason that that quote is trotted out so often is that when you come right down to it, most people don't agree with that. Everybody says they believe in free speech. There's a guarantee of free speech in the Chinese constitution. Right, right, right. It's very easy to say. And what they really mean is, yes, I believe in free speech, but, and it's within the but where you can find out whether or not they really do believe in free speech. So for my money, we shouldn't have a law that prohibits hate speech.
