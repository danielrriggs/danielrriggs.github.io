 Some dating apps put fake profiles of very attractive, usually women, right? Because men are actually more likely to use dating apps and are more likely to pay for the premium profiles compared to women who don't have to, because they're going to get matches anyway. So anyway, the dating app companies, they'll see them with fake, attractive women profiles and intentionally match with men who have recently downloaded a new profile. And the idea here is that if they download the app and they immediately match with an attractive woman, and then they usually have a couple of conversational exchanges like, hey, how's it going? Good. How are you? Then that's it. The robot no longer responds to the user. The reason why this is done is basically to give them a little hit. It's a major hit. They called it chasing the dragon, which is basically a term from drug usage, right? From heroin, you give them a little hit and then they're going to be chasing that high for the rest of their lives. They are creating a lot of heartbreak and a lot of frustration. You won't say which dating app that's too bad because they deserve the exposure, but I understand your reticence. I will say that if one app is doing it, then that means more than likely they all are.
