 The idea that identity is subjectively defined is utterly preposterous. And it's actually an anti-truth because if you try to define your identity subjectively, you are a bloody tyrant and you're gonna be an unpopular one too and you deserve it. Secondarily, we have this other weird insistence and I don't know why we've become so demented that we also accept this, that your identity is subjectively defined. But nonetheless, the core element of your identity is some immutable group characteristic and the one we stress most is sexual attraction. And I suppose the secondary one is something like race. It's so peculiar that your identity is subjectively defined but it's also boxed into this very narrow set of parameters which is, well, the most important thing about you is to whom and to what degree are you sexually attracted? It just leaves me speechless. Well, it doesn't, but you get my point.
