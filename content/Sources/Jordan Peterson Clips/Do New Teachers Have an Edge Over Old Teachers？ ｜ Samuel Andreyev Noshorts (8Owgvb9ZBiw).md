 You don't need to know a hundred times more than the student you're working with in order to Relay something of value to them. No often I found that I was most effective teaching when I was just learning something The problem with becoming a real domain expert, especially after decades of it is you start forgetting what other people don't know And you just take it for granted because you've talked to like-minded people for decades You've thought the same way, you know in that particular specialized area for decades and What you take for granted? bears no relationship to the state of say a lay person's knowledge and so you can't teach anymore because you go over people's heads and So being a beginner teaching, you know as long as you're doing your job properly and staying at least one step ahead of your student There's nothing wrong with that at all
