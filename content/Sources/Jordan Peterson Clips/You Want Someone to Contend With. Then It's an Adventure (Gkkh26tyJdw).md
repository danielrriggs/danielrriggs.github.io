 So what do you want? Well you want someone to contend with? Then it's an adventure you know and then you have someone that you love and that you respect And that's not a bad combination for longevity of relationship And then maybe if you have someone that you love and respect and that you can communicate with then your children Also love and respect her or him and then that's pretty good for them because they've got some parents that they could love and respect That's a good combination You know it solidifies their life and so you want to contend with them you want a job That's challenging I would say that pushes you beyond what you already are and God only knows how much how hard you need to be Pushed in order to go beyond where you are, but you know to some degree If you have a choice You know it's not that uncommon that what we'll do is choose to be pushed to the limit Especially when we're at our best
