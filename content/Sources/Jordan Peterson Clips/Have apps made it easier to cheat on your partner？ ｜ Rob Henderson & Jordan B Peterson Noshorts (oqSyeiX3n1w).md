 It's even easier to cheat. So in the past, if you wanted to be unfaithful to your partner, it was risky because you have the same social circle, you have the same friends, everyone knew everyone else. But now with the apps, you can match with someone who is completely outside of your social reality, outside of your partner's social reality, you can have a very discreet rendezvous. No one will ever know about this. Ghosting has become more common. I don't know if you're about ghosting, but it's basically where you're in a relationship with someone. And after you have sex, you know, once or however many times, then you just vanish. You never see that person again. You know, delete them from your phone, block them on social media. You never have to see them again. And there's no social cost to this. That's a real psychopathic conquest strategy. Yes. Right. Yes. Because the psychopaths, they tend to form relationships that are very predatory and then disappear. Because that way, their reputations stay intact as long as they can continue to disappear.
