 Free speech is not a right among other rights. It's the predicate of all rights. It's also the predicate of a functioning psyche. I mean this, I don't mean this politically. I mean it technically. It's the predicate of a functioning psyche and it's the predicate of a society that can maintain its integrity and its adaptive flexibility simultaneously. To say that is no different than saying that thought is the bedrock of adaptation. If I can speak freely, I can express my thoughts. So then you might think, erroneously, that the reason I have free speech is so that I have the freedom to express my thoughts. And that's also not why I have freedom of speech, even though that's a corollary. I have freedom of speech so that I can think.
