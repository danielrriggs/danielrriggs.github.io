 So one of the things you do if you negotiate with yourself is set a goal and then see if you move towards it. And if you don't, well, maybe it's the wrong goal. Maybe it's too large. Maybe it's too small for you, right? So now it's not engaging you. Maybe you didn't really want to pursue that goal and you're just diluting yourself. And, you know, it's helpful to have someone to talk those things over with. But I would say if you're not doing what you want to do or what you think you should be doing, drop the presumption that you know who you are and start to negotiate with yourself like you're a stranger who needs to be enticed forward. Because you don't know who you are, especially if you're not able to regulate your behaviour. Because that's evidence that you don't know who you are. Something is driving the ship. It's not you. Or it's not the you you think you are. And that's often extremely humiliating to people because you may have to pick a goal that's so low, so lowly, right? That you embarrass yourself half to death by recognising the necessity of you having to practice that.
