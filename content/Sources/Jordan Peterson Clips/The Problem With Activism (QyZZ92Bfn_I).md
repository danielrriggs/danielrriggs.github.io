 We have this idea that we tell young people all the time, and I really do think this is an insidious invitation to their prideful narcissism. First of all, that they should be changing the world, which is a lot to change for people who haven't even been able to live independently yet. And also that if you do wanna change the world, which is what you should do and what you could do, the way you do that is by being an activist. Activist has become professionalized since the mid-60s. So an activist seems to me to be someone who hypothetically advocates for the oppressed, which is already a moral danger. It's because like what the hell made you advocate for the oppressed? Did they elect you? Why are you the spokesman? And what gives you that moral virtue? But also it comes with it, this temptation, because if you're an activist, you're almost always against something, right? You're against industry, you're against fossil fuels, you're against the patriarch, you're against the racist. You're always identifying the problem with the world as being something that some other person who isn't good like you is doing.
