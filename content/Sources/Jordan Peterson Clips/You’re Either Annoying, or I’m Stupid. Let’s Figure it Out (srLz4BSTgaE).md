 It turns out that there's something you're doing that's bothering me, but that might be because I'm stupid Yeah, so you're either annoying or I'm stupid Let's figure it out because if you're annoying I want you to stop because I don't want to be annoyed with you But if I'm stupid and you should tell me because I don't want to be stupid you can tell the truth without Claiming omnipotence, you know, it's not like you're right It's just that that's what you think And so but you you do want to be corrected if you have any sense because why would you want to lug your stupidity forward? Yes apart from the fact that it's painful to confront. I mean and it is yeah, but it's not as painful as lugging it forward So then you're stupid forever That's not that's not advisable You know unless you think that's an advantage But you know stupid is disadvantage is disadvantageous by definition
