 You said the information control was so total that you had absolutely no idea what was happening in the outside world. And you believed at that time that despite what you saw around you, that other countries were much worse. Even till very 90s 21st century, North Koreans do not even know the existence of internet and we do not even have electricity. So of course in school, I never even seen the map of the world. We don't even know what Africa, other continents, other race. They don't teach me that I'm Asian. They teach me that I'm a Kim Yo-Sung race. And North Korean calendar begins not when the Jesus Christ was born, when Kim Yo-Sung was born. They cut out entire information and people literally get executed for watching foreign information. And that is a crime to be dead in North Korea. So you do not have a freedom even to travel abroad. It's an entire black hole of information. You don't know outside the king what's happening.
