 What are some steps to take in order to become better than the person I was in the past? You need to lay out a vision of yourself as an ideal. Who do you want to be five years from now? What do you want your life to be like across the most important dimensions of your life? You need a vision of that. First of all, something to aim at. What would you like your family relationships to be like if they were ideal? What would your intimate relationship be like if it was better? What would your job be like or your career? How might you take care of yourself mentally and physically? How do you make intelligent use of the time that you have for yourself? How do you continually educate yourself? How do you illuminate yourself philosophically and spiritually? You need a vision for that and a plan. And then you have to decompose that into steps that will lead you in that direction.
