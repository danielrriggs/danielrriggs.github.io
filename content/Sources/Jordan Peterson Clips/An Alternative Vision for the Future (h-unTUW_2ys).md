 We're trying to put together something like an alternative vision of the future, say an alternative to that kind of apocalyptic narrative that's being put forward at least implicitly by organizations like the WEF, you know, and that's the virginal planet, rapacious, tyrant, you know, all devouring consumer religion. And it's more like something like, well, we want to ask people six key questions. How do we get energy and resources at the lowest possible cost as rapidly as possible to the largest number of people around the world? That's one question. And so there's a presumption in the question. And here's one of the presumptions. You don't get to save the planet by making energy prices so expensive that no one poor can afford them. That's off the table. So if you want to develop alternative energy sources, no problem. You know, because hey, man, the more energy sources we have, the better. But you don't get to impose your utopian vision in the service of your narcissism on the poor.
