 Question how to handle a situation where the foundation you build everything on is taken away exactly similar to your license situation Well, I Don't know because it's always necessary When asked a question that complex to understand the particulars of the situation the questioner Offered the proposition that it's That his or her situation is similar to mine. So I'll tell you what's been useful in my situation Certain degree of rage I mean the The college has been on my case in one form or another with lawsuits For seven years ever since I Rose to notoriety let's say and not once before then by the way, because I conducted myself very carefully as a professor and in the clinical realm and It's very expensive It's very time-consuming And You know, I have a bit of a temper and so When I walked through the last 13 lawsuits At Christmas, which was not exactly what I wanted to be doing on my off time Let's say there were The dark parts of my psyche making all sorts of dreadful fantasies available for my delectation, let's say and You know unless the circumstances call for absolute mayhem That's not a good war road to walk down or let's say at least it's not the best road to walk down and so if you're Backed into a corner It's very useful to Confer with your anger and let it have its voice and then try to aim up And so I spent a lot of time talking to Tammy and to my daughter Michaela and to my son thinking, okay If we could have the best possible outcome here all things concerned What would that look like and so that's one of the things you have to figure out is What what do you want and what should you want And you have to get that clear and then you have to aim at that so I Have a variety of desired outcomes in my situation Mostly I want to be left alone Although there's more to it than that because I believe that what the college is doing is Akin to what professional boards are doing all across Canada and to some degree in the United States and in Europe and Holding an ideological cudgel over the head of their members instead of regulating their behavior in relationship to their clients and patients, which is what they're supposed to be doing and Something more broadly social than what is merely appropriate in my particular case needs to be done And so I have some ideas on that front which I would be happy to talk to the college about That's highly unlikely although not impossible and So you have to know what you want and then you have to know what you should want Then you have to get your family on board or your friends so that you've got a bit of a community around you And then you have to think strategically You know because it it's no time for impulsivity. It's It's no time for impulsivity. It's it's time for Careful preparation and planning and for all of those of you who are in the crowd right now who? Have some things to say that you need to say but aren't saying them Then you have to ask yourself very very very very seriously What is it about my life that has left me so exposed that I do not dare to say what I need to say You know and that's a scary question It's an admission of vulnerability it can be an admission of failure as well and Then you have to Think through very carefully what you need to do to fortify yourself so that you can regain regain control of your tongue And you might say well, why should I do that and the answer is? Do you want your thoughts to die or do you want to die and that's the answer and so you think well That's a bit extreme. It's like no actually that's just how it is you know in a totalitarian state where Everyone lies about everything all the time and no one ever says what they mean people die by the tens of millions It's par for the course. It's a feature not a bug and so and at some Level of scale that applies in your in your own life And so you're required to live so that you can speak and if you aren't living so that you can speak you need to sort out your life and You might say well, that's impossible, and I would say fair enough You know but the alternative is worse so Lots of times in life you've got like this really difficult thing to do or This really difficult thing to do and that's your options so It's morally required of each of us that we live in a manner that enables us to retain control of our word Right So for the questioner So for the questioner you have to sit down and and you have to take stock of your actions and your circumstance And you have to decide what's? Impeding you from being able to hold your ground and then you have to do what you can to fortify yourself so that you're in a movable object and That's what your family needs from you, too You know when people say Well if I say what I need to say I might get fired yeah And I'm not taking that lightly. I had lots of clients who were in that situation I know how these things work, and I can't do that to my family Fair enough you know But what are you gonna model for your kids? You know you're gonna model abject servility to penny-ante tyrants and All tyrants are penny-ante a because that's what makes them tyrants and not heroes they're Petty and low and Craven and cowardly and deceptive and manipulative and and willing to use shame and assuming guilt rather than innocence and Masters of the low blow and the innuendo and gossip and reputation destruction and You don't want to model defeat by that to your children So You know maybe noble defeat is better than victory so to speak if the victory is a Slavish servitude, and that's worth thinking about you know so lots of Lots of generations of people had to risk death for freedom You know I? Think we all have to do that to maintain freedom So that's the situation the questioner is in
