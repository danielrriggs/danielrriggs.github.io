 I find it wildly important to make light of dark situations. I feel like you have two options to deal with the situation. You either, when it comes to a certain topic, you can either let it take up a negative space in your mind and energy to where, if the word or topic even gets set around you, you get so triggered and uncomfortable, it ruins your day. Or... And the day of everyone around you. Yes, or you can find a way to laugh about it, find a way to heal. So that way, next time somebody brings it up, maybe you have something positive to say about your experience or how you've come to deal with it. And that can then lead to other people healing through the same way. When my grandpa passed away, my friends knew. My friends bombarded me with dead grandfather jokes. They knew that was gonna help me laugh and get through that. And it was the toughest moment of my entire life.
