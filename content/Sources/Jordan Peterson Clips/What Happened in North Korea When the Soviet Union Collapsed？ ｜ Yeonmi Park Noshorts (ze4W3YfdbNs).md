 no private property in North Korea. You don't even own yourself. Everything is state-owned. So therefore, trading is illegal. That is, you are committing a crime. But after the 90s, the Soviet Union collapsed, people had to find their own ways to survive outside of the North Korean government. So the regime created self-reliance ideology. So they told the people, okay, you're alive on your own. We are not going to give you public distribution. You just figure out on your thing. Then they go, how do we figure out on things we don't have freedom, we cannot even trade. So people started getting into this thing called the black market. So what was happening in North Korea simultaneously was that the centralized government distribution system collapsed completely when it was no longer subsidized. And the North Korean government decided that everyone was now on their own, while simultaneously making any ownership and any trade whatsoever illegal and punishable with extreme punishments. So you were on your own, but forbidden to do anything. Exactly.
