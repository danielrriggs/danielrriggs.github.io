 We know very little about the way the body actually works. I'm constantly struck by the fact that our narrative about medicine proceeds from an entirely false premise, which is that we know a great deal about the body and have all of these useful interventions. What we have is a lot of interventions where sometimes we know what one of their effects is. We very rarely understand why the spectrum of collateral consequences are what they are. All of these systems are linked together and nobody is tracking the long-term implications of anything. So we have this sort of obsessive focus on the things that you can detect on very short time scales and almost a studied ignorance of what the same pharmaceuticals or procedures do to us long-term. I suspect if you did the statistics properly that medicine, independent of public health, kills more people than it saves.
