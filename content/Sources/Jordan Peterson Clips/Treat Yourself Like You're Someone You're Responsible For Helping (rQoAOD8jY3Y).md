 Treat yourself like you're someone responsible for helping and that doesn't mean be good to yourself It doesn't mean that me be nice to yourself. It doesn't mean Give yourself an easy life that isn't actually what you do to people if you care for them You actually present them with something like an optimal challenge That's what you do with kids if you love them First of all assume that you're worth taking a care that you're worth taking care of and that it's your responsibility to do So even if you don't like yourself very much and lots of people don't and they have their reasons Because everybody is very aware of their own flaws, right? Unless you're narcissistic you're more aware of your own flaws than of anyone else's flaws And maybe you're not very happy with yourself And you don't think that you deserve to have an okay life And so you punish yourself and you set yourself up for failure and all and all of that and that happens all the time Or you just don't aim or you don't have any goals or you're guilty and resentful and feel that you should be punished So you have to abandon all that? Treat yourself like you're someone you're responsible for helping
