 do not punish behavior you wish to see repeated. And husbands do this to their wives a lot too, especially if they're the jealous type. So imagine you have a wife that maybe you got lucky and you attracted someone who's a little bit above your caliber, or at least that's what you think. And maybe you're right too, you know? And so she's attractive and you're happy about that in some ways, but what about those other men? You know? And so you go out one night and she dresses up and she looks pretty damn sharp and you're a little unhappy about that because you know, what about those other men? And so she asks you how she looks and you take that opportunity to punish her for her beauty. You do that a hundred times. You watch what happens, you think, God, you've let yourself go. It's like, no, I pretty much shaped myself into what you allowed.
