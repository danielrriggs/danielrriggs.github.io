 One of the complaints submitted as evidence the entire transcript of my three hour discussion with Joe Rogan. Yeah. And so, you know, and I said all sorts of horrible things on that. Yeah, I know everything this man ever said. That entire podcast was harmful. Yeah. So how do you defend yourself against that? I think they were objecting primarily to my comments about climate change models and the apocalyptic conclusions that have been derived from them.

And I can read a scientific paper and understand it, unlike those who are accusing me or the people who sit on the college, by the way.
