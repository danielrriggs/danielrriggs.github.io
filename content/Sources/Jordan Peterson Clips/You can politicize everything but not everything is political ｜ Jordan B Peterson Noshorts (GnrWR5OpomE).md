 It's almost impossible to have a discussion about anything and have the coverage not be politicized. I think that's partly a function of how the media, the legacy media work, because they tended to view everything through a political lens, and also a consequence of this insistence, and this I think comes primarily from the radical left, that everything is political, and I don't buy that. It's like, you can say that everything has a political aspect, but that's a completely different claim than everything is political, which is a totalizing claim, and I also, as a social scientist, don't like totalizing claims, because most things are multivariate complex. Yeah, I think we can prove that you can politicize everything, but not everything is political.
