 Identity isn't only a consequence of your subjective experience. Identity seems to me to be a handbag of tools that you employ to make your way in the natural and social world. It's something more pragmatic. It's like the role you might play if you were playing a game with other people. And you can pick your role, but it has to be part of the game. And that means that people have to accept you as a player, and that there are certain functions that you have to undertake when you fulfill that role. And that's actually beneficial to you because partly what you want from an identity is a set of guidelines for how it is that you should act in the world. And I think trans is a good example of that, is that even if the category was accepted as valid on the grounds of its proposed validity, which is the felt sense of being a man if you're a woman or being a woman if you're a man, it isn't obvious what that buys you.
