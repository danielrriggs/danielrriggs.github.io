 There have been 120,000 incidents of police investigated speech hate crime in Britain. How long? The statistic I quote is between 2014 and 2019 there are 120,000 recorded incidents of non-crime hate incidents and this is something which is now routine. We don't have constitutional protection for free speech, we don't have a first amendment. If you go to the government's website on hate hate speech there are five protected characteristics and these fall into race, gender, sexuality, gender identity and disability. If a victim perceives that any speech or crime was motivated by hatred towards any of those five protected characteristics then it qualifies as a hate crime if it's criminal. If it's not criminal, if it's just speech or something like that, it qualifies as a non-crime hate incident. They will record that and although non-crime incidents don't lead to prosecution they do go on a criminal reference check that many people take. We call it a disclosure and barring service so it can affect your employment prospects.
