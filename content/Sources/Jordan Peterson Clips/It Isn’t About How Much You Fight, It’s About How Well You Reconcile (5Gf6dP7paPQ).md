 You might be afraid of a conflict because maybe the conflict will shatter the marriage. And then you think, well, how much conflict can we engage in? And the answer is, depends on how committed you are to reconciliation. Because it isn't how much you fight, it's how well you reconcile. And you might say, well, we don't want to fight in front of the children. It's like, well, no, you don't want to fight counter-productively in front of the children. But one of the best things that children can see, in my estimation, is a pretty heated discussion, followed by a positive resolution, followed by the establishment of peace. Even if it's a consequence of unreasonable behavior on one of the part of one or both partners, the child needs to see that difficult problems can be mutually broached, and a solution thereby engendered, even when it's accompanied by heat.
