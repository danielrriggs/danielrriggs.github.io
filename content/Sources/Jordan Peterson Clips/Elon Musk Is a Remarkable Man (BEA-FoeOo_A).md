 Well, it isn't obvious to me that I'm in any position to evaluate Elon Musk. Like I would like to talk to him and find out what he's up to and why, but I mean, he's an impossible person. What he's done is impossible. All of it. He built an electric car that works. Now, does it work completely and will it replace gas cars or should it? I don't know. If we're going to build electric cars, he seems to be the best at that by a lot. And he more or less did that. People carp about him, but he more or less did that by himself. I know he's very good at distributing responsibility and all of that, but he's the spearhead and then that was pretty hard. And then he built a rocket at like one 10th, the price of NASA rockets. And then he shot his car out into space. That's pretty hard. And then he's building this boring company. It's sort of, it's this whimsical joke in some sense, but it was not a joke. He's amazing.
