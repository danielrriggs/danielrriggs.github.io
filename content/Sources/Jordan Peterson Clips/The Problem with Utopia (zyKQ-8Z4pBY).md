 In notes from underground, Dostoevsky famously pointed out that if we did bring about the socialist utopia, and he described that as the endless opportunity to sit in pools of bubbling water, busy ourselves with the continuation of the species and eat nothing but cake, that human beings would break it all into a chaotic mess at the first opportunity just so that something exciting could happen. The problem with a satiation vision of heaven, so that would be a vision where everyone has everything they need all the time, is that when you do that with an infant or when you enter that state after Thanksgiving dinner, Christmas dinner, all you do is go to sleep. There's no reason to be conscious. Consciousness demands something like an adventure. And the classic vision of heaven does seem lacking in that it isn't obvious what you would do there. That's something we could delve into.
