 What cures in therapy is truth That's the curative now. There's exposure to the things you're afraid of and avoiding as well but I would say that's a form of enacted truth because if you know there's something you should do by your own set of rules and You're avoiding it, then you're enacting a lie. You know you're not telling one, but you're acting one out It's the same damn thing so if I can get you to Face what it is that you're confronting that you know you shouldn't be avoiding then what's happening is that we're both partaking In the process of attempting you to act out your deepest truth and what happens is that that improves people's lives And it improves them radically and the evidence the clinical evidence for that is overwhelming We know that if you expose people to the things they're afraid of but that they're avoiding they get better And you have to do it carefully and cautiously and with their own participation and all of that but Of all the things that clinicians have established that's credible That's number one and that's nested inside this deeper realization that the clinical experience is Redemptive let's say because it it's designed to address suffering in so far as the people who are engaged in the process Are both telling each other the truth and then you think well obviously Because if you have some problems and you come to talk to me about them Well first of all just by coming to talk to me about them you've admitted that they exist man That's a pretty good start and second well if you tell me about them We know what they are and then if we know what they are we can maybe start to lay out some solutions And then you can go act out the solutions and see if they work But if you don't admit they're there And you won't tell me what they are and I don't and I'm like posturing and and acting Egotistically and taking the upper hand and all of that in our discussions. Well how the hell is that going to work? You know it might be comfortable moment to moment while we stay encapsulated in our delusion But it's not going to work so a lot of that seems if you think it through it seems pretty self-evident and you know Freud thought that repression was at the heart of much mental suffering the difference between repression and deception is a Matter of degree and that's all it's technical It's a technical differentiation and Alfred Adler who was one of Freud's greatest Associates that say and much underappreciated I would say he thought that people got into problems because they started to act out a life lie That's what he called it a life lie That's worth looking up because Adler although not as charismatic as Freud was very practical and and and Really foreshadowed a lot of later developments in cybernetic theory and of course you believe that you could bypass Psychotherapy entirely by merely making a proper moral effort in your own life and Carl Rogers believed that it was honest communication Mediated through dialogue that had redemptive consequences and the behaviors believe that you do a careful Micro-analysis of the problems that are laid before you and help introduce people to what they're avoiding It's like all of those things to me are just secular variations of the notion that truth will set you free essentially
