 We take it for granted that slavery is wrong. Why we think it's wrong is not so bloody obvious. And so one of the things I wonder about constantly, for example, is the Marxists complain about oppression and slavery constantly, but I have no idea why, within the confines of their ideology, it's wrong. Because in order to believe that slavery is wrong, you have to believe that individuals are sovereign, right? That they should be autonomous, that they have free will, and that they shouldn't be subject to the arbitrary dictates of other individuals. So you have to believe in individuals, you have to believe in sovereign individuals, you have to believe in free will. You also have to believe in intrinsic value, right? Because if you have no intrinsic value, why can't I just impress upon you my will if I can get away with it?
