 You don't want no responsibility. It's wrong. People find the meaning in their life by adopting responsibility. And so, provision of money... You know, they say, man does not live by bread alone. And there's wisdom in that. It's like, you don't want no responsibility. You might dream about that if you're crushed by your job.
