 When I was in the UK a few years ago, I saw a number of things that I felt were disturbing. People seem to have accepted the omnipresence of CCTV cameras to a degree that I found horrifying, frankly. I don't like the message they portray, which is that everyone is criminal enough so they should be surveyed all the time. I noticed too in London in particular that many buildings had instituted airport level security so that you had to pass through a metal detector and have your bags checked etc while you were moving in and out of buildings. It struck me as quite horrifying given that as far as I'm concerned Great Britain and its legal and parliamentary traditions are the epicenter or at the epicenter of Western freedoms. I mean you could make a case for France I suppose but not a strong one as far as I'm concerned. Yet your citizens seem to have accepted this with virtually no problem.
