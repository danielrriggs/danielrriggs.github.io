 You think about cell phones when they first come out, they're like $25,000. And so there's some people who can afford a $25,000 cell phone and they buy them and then now they're worth $20,000. And then more people can buy them because it's the $20,000 price range. I mean, if we didn't have radical inequalities in income distribution, would we ever be able to introduce new expensive products into the market?
