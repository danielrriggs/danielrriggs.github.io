 One of the reasons that pornography is so rampant, even among people who are in relatively permanent relationships, is that it's a bad approximation to a good art, right? It's that people's sexual longing is deep and plastic, and it takes an awful lot of courage to make what it demands consciously apprehensible and communicable, and to share that desire with the person that you love. That's the true revelation of nakedness. That's another way of thinking about it, because what else would that be? But if you dare to do that, you might find out that you can encourage an active partner in play, and that that will provide you with what you need and want within the confines of a relationship that also simultaneously provides you with everything else you need and want. That's a pretty good deal.
