 you go to talk to mom and you say, where'd you hear this? I heard this on CBS. Where'd you hear this? I heard this on 4chan. It's, it's very clear which one mom is going to choose. No, I agree. But you described trolling as something that's actually quite specific. It's in its intent when it isn't just being say adolescent foolishness. It's something like, can we create a narrative and string along legacy media types? And some of that's a joke, but some of it's also a test. Is like, does this new technological platform have enough power to to bend and twist what has been the standard means of delivering the cultural narrative for decades? And the answer to that frequently was yes. And increasingly the legacy media outlets are suffering from delegitimization. They lose money. They lose their ability to fact check. And because they don't have this technological advantage anymore, they have the remnants of their brand.
