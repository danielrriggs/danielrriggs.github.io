 Good morning, Dr. Peterson I'm wondering what the proper course of action is if a person is unable to save their father from the belly of the whale Well, I would say on the psychological side the most appropriate action is to reconstitute your father from the fragments of fathers that are available to you, you know, and you see children do this anyways automatically as they assemble a father from the plethora of images and exemplars of paternal behavior that they're exposed to right so some of that and the Largest part is modeled by their actual father assuming they're in contact with him. But you know you can learn you can learn to incorporate the spirit of the benevolent father from From uncles from family friends from heroes in movies from great authors from great men in the past and What you have to do and so Jung also pointed this out as developmental necessity It's like the spirit of the father is not the same as your father And if you have your father confused with the spirit of your father of the father Let's say you're still going to be under the thumb of your father and that's not a good thing You need to abstract out the universal image of the benevolent Patriarchal let's say and you need to use that as a guide That's what a humanities education was supposed to do for people by the way it was supposed to introduce them to the great characters of history and to introduce the acolyte or the the apprentice to that body of thought and practice and to catalyze Identification with that metafother and that would be a step on the way Let's say to developing a relationship with the supreme father That's another way of thinking about it and that would be that's characterized, you know as the God who eternally rules from above so if you can't rescue your own father from the belly of the beast then you turn to the father as such and I would Also say to the degree that you're capable of doing that and then you put what you've learned into practice in your life You'll turn into the sort of person that might turn into a model for your own father And it might be that that would be the best way to rescue even him from the abyss you know if a father has a son whose Moral conduct outstrips his own if there's any love left there Then that can be pretty compelling evidence to the father to straighten up his own life and to start to fly straight so You
