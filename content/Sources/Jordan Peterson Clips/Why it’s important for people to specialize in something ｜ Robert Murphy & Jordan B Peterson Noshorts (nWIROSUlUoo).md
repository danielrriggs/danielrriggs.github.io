 specialization maximizes productivity and then trade is of benefit to all. We don't band together to tyrannize each other. We band together to maximize our productivity and we do that to stave off the catastrophes of nature, let's say, so that we have enough to eat and enough to drink and we don't die from some bloody miserable disease. Our standard of living rests on the fact that we all specialize in what we do best, produce way more of our thing than we need personally and trade it with others. Certain people specialize in our farmers and they grow way more food than they need and sell the rest to others and some people just make a bunch of sweaters way more than their family needs to wear and they sell it. Some people just make a bunch of cars way more than they're going to drive and they sell it. We all end up with more food, sweaters, cars. Yeah, that's because once you build one car, building the second one is a lot easier. People have different abilities. Certain regions around the world just are more hospitable. Clearly the people in Florida should specialize in growing oranges and people in Alaska should. So we can capitalize on the unequal distribution of productive resources by trading.
