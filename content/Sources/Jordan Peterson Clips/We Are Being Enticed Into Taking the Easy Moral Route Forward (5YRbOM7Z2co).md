 And so, you know, you said that you think that people are mostly motivated by by positive inclinations and I'm inclined to agree with that But I do think and I think we really have to come to terms with this is that We are being enticed Into taking the easy moral route forward. So there isn't anything more important to someone economically practically socially biologically Than their reputation because their reputation is a marker of their deserved standing in the social community and their viability as a trading and playing partner And the pro and the way that you accrue reputation points is through diligent effort and generosity fundamentally But you can game that and you game that by by taking shortcuts to ethical prowess When you're when you're offered them in a tempting manner, it's like well instead of getting up at it I'll give you an example bjorn. This is a good example You know how I stopped being faced by protests at universities when I went to talk there I have my I hold my talks at eight o'clock in the morning Yeah, and you know why that's funny because none of the bloody protesters will haul themselves out of bed to come and you know Agitate about that the magical super nazi because it's eight in the morning. Yeah, it is funny, but it's also exactly right It's like well, yeah, you're once you shake off your hangover days You can Haul yourself out of bed by six in the afternoon To go and protest and wave a sign about all the evil people who are destroying the world But if your commitment requires getting up in the morning once well, that's a bit too much for you And so this this enticement of laziness And it's it's this weird nexus between narcissism and willful blindness and ignorance because they they they foment And and reinforce each other and as I said, it's it's just not that hard to read your book especially if you're you've devoted your life to saving the environment and i've done what I could to Bring hammer and tongs to your theories because your books are pretty damn optimistic and I think well could that possibly be real? And I haven't been able to break well what I haven't been able to do about your approach is to think of a better one Thank you as as error prone as it might be Because who can do cost benefit analysis, of course, it's like, okay, but right and again Uh the the the amazing things, you know, the the the best things we can do in the world are not just you know Twice as good they're more like a hundred times or a thousand times better Than the really dumb things that we very often do and that's of course why we feel much more comfortable about it But if it was just a factor of two sure, you know, that could be all kinds of calculations and stuff But when you're a thousand times off Maybe we should start paying attention on where we could do good and and it gets back to your point of of what happened For instance in holland, which was driven by a court case So if you take politicians on their words and they'll they'll make a lot of different promises Imagine if people took them to court for all of those promises Imagine what would happen when courts say well, you've said this so we you have to spend that much money If you actually did that for all the different things politicians have said, I think it's plausible that you would actually have A total account that would be higher than the entire national budget quite possibly by a large amount Imagine if we allow the courts to say oh in this case you promised this so you got to do that Oh in this case you promised this so you got to do that Imagine if the courts did all of that and then basically said i'm sorry you've got to spend all of your gdp So everybody has to pay, you know close to 100 percent in taxes and we're going to pay all of these things that politicians have promised That's ridiculous. And it's of course terrible This is exactly why we have politics because politics is that very hard decision between a lot of different Nice competing things that we would like we both like to have less nitrogen deposits. We'd like to have better agriculture We'd also like to have safer roads and we'd like to have better schools and all these other things We can't spend all of the money, you know 10 times over So that's why we have politicians making these hard and complicated and not, you know satisfying decisions But we shouldn't allow ourselves to be run, you know into courts Deciding no you have to do this because you promised it because if they did it across the whole area We'd probably be you know, both bankrupt, but also we would not have that crucial conversation about where do you want to spend the next dollar? Well, we would also cede all the legislative power that should be instantiated in the sovereign voice of the people to Judicial overlords, which we seem to be doing at a very rapid rate That's happening in canada partly because the legislatures are cowardly and they devolve decisions to the judiciary when they shouldn't but also because The judiciary has become increasingly activist and is perfectly willing to put their apocalyptic nightmare uh What vision at the pinnacle of the judicial process hierarchy and to start ruling in accordance with that instead of relying on precedent rule of law I mean in canada now, you know, you cannot be appointed a judge unless you swear fealty essentially to the die Mantra they they put they've laid out what the personal requirements are that are necessary to be a judge and one of them is sensitivity to all the racial etc issues that the dei activists hypothetically believe are a necessary priority and the second one is Um What would it say openness to the importance of social justice issues that they've actually documented this now in the steps necessary to become a judge In canada. Yeah, it's unbelievable. It's unbelievable and these activist judges do believe that well They're way more efficient than that noisy parliamentary process And and that should scare us that is, you know part of the reason why a lot of people are protesting uh simply because you can't have A judiciary or anything that ends up making promises that will cost you At least a large part of your fortune Just perhaps before I get going If you look at net zero because I think in some way, uh, the dutch thing that we've seen that we've seen and even the european conversation remember, uh, uh, I believe it was um I forget it was city group that estimated the total cost for europe Because of the increasing energy prices is going to be about half a trillion dollars higher than it normally is over the last 10 years Uh, which is a huge cost, but let's just remember if europe was actually serious about their net zero goals Which of course is going to be incredibly hard which basically means we'll have to give up most of what we think of Wonderful, uh in the world according to mckinsey study that would cost more than a trillion dollars. So twice as much But every year for the next 30 years So if we had courts going in and saying no, you've got to you know, cut down your nitrogen deposit cost that will be terribly disruptive But it's much much less than what you could actually imagine is going to happen Uh, if if people actually take our net zero promises, uh seriously and this is not just for uh, for europe, you know in the u.s It's likely that the cost of net zero by the uh by mid century would be in the order of 12 000 per person per year Uh, and and people are just not going to accept that remember if you ask people Most people are willing to spend, you know something on climate change typically so sort of between 25 and 200 But if you ask them, so would you be okay with spending 10 000? No, that's not gonna happen and you're gonna happen Operating that's I think why we need to say well, we should be smart about this But we shouldn't be spending all of our money on one thing. That's both dumb. It's also economically inefficient But it also leaves all the other challenges unfixed
