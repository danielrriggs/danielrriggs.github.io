 There's been a lot of really radical changes in our society in the last 50 years, and we don't understand their consequences. The most radical change is probably the birth control pill, because it's provided women with voluntary control over the reproductive function, and that's a equivalent to a major biological mutation, right? Its consequence is virtually incomprehensible. I mean, partly, one of the consequences is, you know, where reliable birth control is provided to women, first of all, they immediately become educated, second, their economies tend to grow, and third, the birth rate falls below replacement. And then all three of those factors are monumental, you know, so perhaps especially the third, the falling of the birth rate below replacement, which is the case in virtually every country in the Western world except the United States.
