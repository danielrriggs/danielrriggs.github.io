 Married men are more likely to experience divorce if they watch any amount of pornography. And it's sort of, you know, the more pornography they use, the more likely they are to get divorced. I mean, this is a very recent invention too, sort of streaming digital pornography. I've heard that researchers are having difficulty even studying this simply because they can't really find a control group. There's no young men who don't watch porn, at least have never not been exposed to it. So this is a very difficult thing for them to even study. Right, well it's another indication of the emergence of polygamy because it's virtual polygamy. You can have an unlimited number of attractive sexual partners. Now it's all virtual. That is a transformative technology. I mean, you can see more pictures of nude women in one day than anybody in history would have ever seen in their entire life.
