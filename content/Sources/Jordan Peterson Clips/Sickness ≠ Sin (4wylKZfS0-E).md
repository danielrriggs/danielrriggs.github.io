 Everyone asks himself when they get sick, have I done something wrong that's increased the probability that I have become ill? And it's a terrible thing to ask yourself because you add the moral burden to the catastrophe and you don't want to leap right to that conclusion. But it's also an open question, how healthy would you be if you were oriented constantly to the highest possible good? Well, it's a terrible danger though, in that too. It's a very tough issue. Yes, it's terrible. It's terrible. It's the issue of gold. It is tempting for people, true, exactly, and it's very tempting for people to then look at people who are sick and say, oh, that's a sinner. Yeah, right, right. And that's very cruel and unjust and ungodly and everything you say. I just want to just say, because I've dealt with this a lot, God promises that if you keep the commandments, I will not bring any of the diseases I brought upon the Egyptians. My general read of all of these this worldly rewards is that it's collective and not individual because otherwise God would be proven wrong in a day.
