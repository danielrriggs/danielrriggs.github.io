 I can't read physics papers in physics journals. I'm not mathematically gifted. And so there are all sorts of scientific and mathematical claims that I can't evaluate. But most of the time when I read a book, if I don't understand it, I believe that the author hasn't made it clear. And I've read some difficult people. I've read Jung who's unbelievably difficult, Nietzsche and neuroscience texts, Jaak Panksepp, Gray's book, Neuropsychology of Anxiety. That bloody book took me six months to read. It's a tough book. It's 1500 references, something like that. And an idea pretty much in every sentence. When I hit Lecain and Derrida, it was like, it's not that I'm stupid. It's that you're playing a game. You're one of those rare animals that said, wait a minute, he's saying bullshit because I know that I can think and I'm not getting him. The problem is that most people that are sitting passively in the audience didn't come with your confidence.
