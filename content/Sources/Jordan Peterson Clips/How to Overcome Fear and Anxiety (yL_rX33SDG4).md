 Exposure is probably the cardinal technique It's like if I can find out what you're avoiding and get you to confront it voluntarily You'll get better and the reason seems to be is that if you get people to confront what they're afraid of and sometimes what? Disgusts them, but what they'd like to avoid that say if you get them to confront it voluntarily. They don't get less afraid They get braver and that's different It's not like they get accustomed to what they're looking at and they're no longer afraid that kind of happens But it isn't really what happens what really happens is they discover there's a lot more to them than they thought and so they're not as easily Intimidated then and so if you run a clinical client through a session of exposure therapy Maybe they're afraid of an elevator or something like that You get them so they'll go in the elevator and sometimes they're often women because women have anxiety disorders more often than men One of the unintended consequences of that often is they'll go home and have the fight with their husband That's been brewing for 30 years Because they're now braver they see themselves in a different light because they've confronted this thing that terrifies them
