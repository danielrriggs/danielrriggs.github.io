 We know, for example, that self-consciousness, imagine you think about yourself all the time, what's that associated with? Well, it loads on neuroticism. The more self-conscious you are, the more miserable you are. That's why self-consciousness entered, brought tragedy into the world in the story of Adam and Eve. So the more self-conscious you are, the more miserable you are. It's not about you. Do you want it to be about you? How about if it's about other people? Well, the more you think about other people. If you go into a party and your goal is to make everyone else feel at ease, you won't be anxious. But if your goal when you go to a party is, I don't want to be anxious, all you'll do is think about how anxious you are, and all that will do is make you awkward, and all that will do is make you anxious, then you'll have a miserable time at the party. And it's a kind of narcissism.
