 He identified Satan with betrayal. So Dante was trying to understand, you know, imagine that if you do something wrong by your own lights, let's say, and now you're accusing yourself, if you go all the way to the bottom of that, the rationale, you'll find the worst thing. You have to go down all nine levels of hell to find what's at the bottom. And for Dante, it was betrayal. And I think that's right. One of the things that fosters social order is trust. And what a betrayer does is use trust against you. And if you're looking at something that will traumatize you, especially if you betray yourself, but betrayal period, it's laying that out as the deepest of potential sins is wise. Anyways, Dante's Inferno is a taxonomy of evil. It's useful to know that when you read it, because that's exactly what he was trying to do.
