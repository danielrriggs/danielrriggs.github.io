 Spring wasn't a time of hope and renewal, but the absolute worst time of the year. Most of people die in the spring because that's when there is no like really insects and plants are. Season of death. In the March of 2007, I had a really bad stomach ache and my mom took me to the hospital. But in North Korea, of course, there's no electricity. There's no x-ray machines. None of that. Literally a nurse using one meter to inject every patient in the hospital. And people don't die from cancer in North Korea. They die from infection and hunger mostly. From our hospital to the bathroom, there are like piles of human bodies piled up. And you see children like chasing the rats, eating, just rats eating human eyes first. And then children catch these rats and they eat and they somehow die from I don't know what it is. Then rats eat the children back. So this cycle of us eating rats and they eat us back is going to continue and continue.
