 I've tried to think well what is the university? Part of it is, well this it's this continuous conversation across centuries, part of it is the exposure to the greatest thinkers and for the purpose of of mimicry essentially I believe that's central to it because you can pick your peers in some sense that's what you do when you read great books is you make these people your peers at least insofar as you're capable of doing that. Yeah I agree with you. But then there's also an identity that it provides you with is you're a student you've got this time that's cut out and now you can go throw yourself into the study and society has built a wall around you that says yes you can stay in this room and you're good read away we're happy about it.
