 what happens to North Koreans as they move with the traffickers. In North Korea, it's most heavily guarded border. We were lucky to drive the guards across the frozen river to China. Of course, the first thing I see was my mom being raped infirmly. And you said that your mother offered herself as an alternative to you, and you were 13 at the time. And that was your first introduction to sex of any sort, because there was no sexual education or contact for young people. Never even knew what rape was. That word was not even in my head. I just seeing something so horrible that I didn't want to see. And after that, they took us to this house where they would literally make us stand up, make us turn around, take our teeth and everything, and making price on our body. I was 13 years old. I was a virgin. So my price would be less than $300. And my mom's price was less than $100. And they sold me separately from my mom. That's how I got separated from all my family at 13.
