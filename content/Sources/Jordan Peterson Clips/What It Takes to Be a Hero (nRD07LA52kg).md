 The thing that should be sovereign is the thing that can step outside the structured order, incorporate something new and dangerous, and then produce something valuable out of it. Another hero myth is the person who criticizes the power elite when it becomes corrupt, and points out the corruption, and then restructures the society. That happens in the prophetic books, for example, continually in the Old Testament, because you could think that the historical enemies of humanity are twofold in some sense. One is the chaos that comes from outside, and that disrupts the standard order that needs to be dealt with, and the other is the chaos that comes in the inside when our institutions and hierarchies become corrupt. And then the thing that transforms that is the thing that has enough courage either to stand up against the chaos, or to say something about the corrupt institutions.
