 Everybody acknowledges that Jewish chosenness is a reason for anti-Semitism. However, as I pointed out, Jews are two-tenths of one percent of the world. Who gives a damn if two-tenths of one percent of the world thinks they're chosen? The Chinese think they're the center of the world. Well, chosen and successful might be a very... Thank you. That's correct. That's exactly right. So deep down, people don't laugh when Jews say they're chosen. They don't believe that Japan gets the sun before the rest of humanity, even though they are the land of the rising sun and as the sun is on their flag. But nobody cares if the Japanese think they get the sun first. But they do care if the Jews think they're chosen. So there's been a tremendous amount of resentment of the fact that maybe they are. But of course, chosen never meant better. Never.
