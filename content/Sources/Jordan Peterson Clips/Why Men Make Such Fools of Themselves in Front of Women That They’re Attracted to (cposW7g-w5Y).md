 A very large number of my clinical clients, but also young men I've talked to in general, are absolutely terrified of women, because they're terrified of being rejected. And the terror exists in precise proportion to the retraction to the woman. Which is a horrible paradoxical situation to be in, and it's often why men make such fools of themselves in front of women that they're attracted to. It's because, first of all, they don't see the woman that they're attracted to. Because what the hell do they know about her? They don't see her as an individual. They see her as the manifestation of a judgmental ideal. And then, it's only in establishing the relationship with the actual woman that they can start differentiating between the judgmental ideal and the actual individual woman. And that also requires a sacrifice. And the sacrifice is... You never can have an ideal woman.
