 There isn't much difference in taking care of yourself and in taking care of other people because i'm actually a group And the reason i'm a group is well, there's me today But there's me over the next week and there's me over the next month and then there's me over the next year and over The next five years and over the next 10 years and the me that exists right now Can't betray the me that's going to exist next week by doing something short-sighted and Impulsive that will you know produce a burst of impulsive pleasure but will compromise the future And so if i'm taking myself into account Seriously, which i'm an entity that has multiple incarnations Let's say across very large spans of time then I immediately have a community that I have to serve I have to serve the 80 year old person that i'm going to become And the difference between that and serving 80 year old people in the community is negligible It's the same thing
