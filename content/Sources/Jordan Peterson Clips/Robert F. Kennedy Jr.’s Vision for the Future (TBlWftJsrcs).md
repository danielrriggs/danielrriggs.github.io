 My approach to energy is using free markets and not top-down control. So what I would do is I would end subsidies and then I would let marketplace determine what's going to happen as renewable energy is going to triumph. Because you can build a solar plant for $1 billion a gigawatt today. A wind plant costs about $1.2 billion. A coal plant costs $3.6 billion. Cycle gas turbines cost probably a couple billion a gigawatt. Once you build a wind or solar, it's free energy forever. So it's always going to be cheaper. The problem with renewable energies like that is we do not have a transportation system to get them to market. So we need a marketplace. We need a grid system that can allow every individual in our country to become an energy entrepreneur.
