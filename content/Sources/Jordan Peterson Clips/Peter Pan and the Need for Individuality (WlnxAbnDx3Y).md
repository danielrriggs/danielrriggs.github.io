 well that's the son devouring father that's a painting by Medina of Satan pretty horrifying one and that's Captain Hook I really like the figure of Captain Hook some of these popular mythological stories, myth based fairy tales, modern fairy tales have got things really right Captain Hook, well, he's a pirate so, I think I told you that in the Google engineers investigations of female sexual fantasies the pirate played a large role werewolf, vampire, pirate, surgeon, billionaire incredibly comical well pirate, you know, captain of the high seas and someone willing to break rules there's a romance in that figure so the idea of the great father as the pirate is a good one well, Hook is kind of a pathetic pirate and of course pirates are precisely that, because they're all so crooked and so what makes him pathetic? well, it isn't because he's got a hook precisely because maybe that's just a sign of adventure it's because he's being chased by a crocodile with a clock in its stomach well that's the dragon of chaos, right? that's time, tick tick tick your life is going to end, it's already got a piece of you and it's coming for the rest and so Hook is terrified of that he's terrified into resentment and evil roughly speaking, it's why he can prey on other people and so that's the father in the Peter Pan story out in Neverland, which is the archetypal domain Captain Hook's the father well why would Peter Pan want to grow up to be Captain Hook? well he doesn't and so he stays Pan, Pan means everything, right? like pantheism he stays everything, he's this divine child, he never wants to grow up well why would you sacrifice the potential of youth and so he's a child of nothing but a death obsessed tyrant well that's the story in Peter Pan and of course Wendy's in the story and so is Tinkerbell, Tinkerbell is the imagined feminine she doesn't even exist, she's just this perfect little thing that's always around whenever Peter Pan needs her but the problem with Tinkerbell is that she's a fairy and fairies don't exist he has Wendy there, she's a real girl she grows up and actually marries someone and so he stays king of the lost boys forever and you know maybe it's better to be king of the lost boys than not to be king at all, but maybe not too king of the damned is not exactly something it's not a dominance hierarchy to strive for dominating so that's the Peter Pan story and it's the right story for the modern age, that's for sure so that's a negative element of the great father there's a positive element of the great father this is a representation of Moses receiving the rules for living from God on high well we talked about that already and I see that's a story of the revelation of structure that's the story of mankind we're acting out a moral structure, well what is it now and then we get a glimpse of what the moral structure is and it hits people with the force of a revelation and that's partly what the story of Moses lays out you see here, this picture I really like this one too, this is a supplicant basically someone who's hit hard by a divine vision it's God in heaven, again very similar to this with the cross in the background and it's something like, to transcend your littleness because look, he's looking up, that's what's at the top of the dominance hierarchy, it's what's at the top full possible dominance hierarchies look up, that's the father who supports the son that's transcending his own vulnerability willing to bear it voluntarily and not to shirk from that it's exactly right, and it is what you admire in people you admire people who are courageous and who are strong, and when you decompose that it means that they're able to act appropriately compassionate, wise, and tough manner despite the fact that they're beset with all of the problems of mortality that beset everyone else well, how does it go wrong? well, that's all propaganda for Hitler look at the imagery, he's a knight, that's on the right he's the knight of nationalism well, that's God the father too, you know it's a little bit one-sided, right, because there's more to than the state, that's the thing and that's the problem with nationalism and its totalitarian variance and we're moving in that direction fast you see Europe right now fragmenting again because the European Union is too amorphous and maybe not well enough bordered and everyone is getting nervous, and they're saying back to the state it's fair enough, fair enough you need to be around people who are like you, so to speak and to be able to build a consensus with but to subordinate yourself to the state and to make its head the bearer of the archetype of the knight without having that element of individuality and it is absolutely pathological we've already been down that road, right because the national socialists were hypernational just like both in Germany and in Italy and that bird should be the dove, because that should be the Holy Ghost if the iconography was proper, but it's not, it's an eagle and an eagle is a bird of carrion eater it feeds on corpses well, it's worth thinking about so that's the woman worshipping the strong father another representation of Hitler as a knight, and then there's Hitler as wise father you see he's surrounded by people there who focused in on him as if he's of archetypal import and you see a poster from the allies an anti-Nazi poster from the allies and you see right there that Hitler and the Nazis are assimilated to a mess of predatory snakes, it's like, well why if you want to appeal to someone's determination to destroy you say, well here you are and you're all ready to go let's go kill some snakes, and everyone can say yes and then you say, well there's the snakes right there and the thing is it's true to some degree it's a kind of snake, just like everyone else and so it's easy, that's the first step towards demonization and you can do it just like that, it's no problem the archetype will map perfectly, especially if there's already tension between the groups, or if the other group is identifiable in some manner, or you can make it identifiable disgust is the best way to do that, not fear disgust, fear, to fear someone you have to respect them you don't want to burn everything that the person that you fear owns you want to burn everything that the person who disgusts you owns and so you'll see people who are pushing the nationalist agenda hard, and Hitler did this beautifully everything that was outside of the Aryan domain of purity, wasn't to be feared, it was disgusting, it was contemptuous, and it should be destroyed and purified by fire and that was his message, the Nazis were unbelievably great at using fire of purification as a symbolic message well, it has an archetypal power, and then you see here this is an English poster from the World War II, asking people to buy bonds to fund the American, or the British war effort, and you see these talon-like claws, Japan and Nazi Germany reaching out to the virgin mother and her infant child, right? deep subordination of archetypal imagery for the purposes, well I hesitate to say propaganda because World War II in some sense was pretty clear cut but you get the point and there's the uniformity of the state so the goose step, everybody moves exactly the same way everybody's turned into exactly the same carbon copy of everyone else, all the diversity is pushed out of the state, it's subordinated to the supreme leader and the hierarchy becomes incredibly rigid and homogeneous it's like, well that's great for fast action but it's terrible if you don't know where you're going you need some diversity, you need some flaws in the crystalline structure in case you're on the wrong path and that's why you can't have everyone being the supreme leader's acolytes, the whole bloody thing wanders off in one direction and because we don't know the right direction to go wandering off in a single direction is extraordinarily dangerous you will eventually fall over a cliff so there's the Nazi's use of light at night they were unbelievably good at their this is one of the things that made fascism so difficult to fight with communism, because it was a fully articulated philosophy you could attack it rationally, but fascism never really did that what they did instead was use ritual huge mass rallies and highly emotionally supercharged meetings and then the use of light and fire so Hitler built the biggest parade grounds in human history to host the Nuremberg rallies he would get in front of them on this huge stage with Greek columns, very impressive looking and have blocks of thousands of people organized perfectly orderly, the Germans are good at order associated with disgust sensitivity incredibly organized orderly displays complete and then at night with fire and behind them he would have all of the searchlights from the Luftwaffe lined up, dozens of them shooting their light straight up, miles into the sky so he'd stand in front of these incredibly impressive displays of light long before there were rock shows and so forth doing that, you know, it was unparalleled in history he was very good at addressing the crowd he'd say something and if people were listening he'd say more of it and if they were listening he'd say more of it and because he was addressing the mob the mob got exactly from Hitler what they wanted and we saw what that was like, 120 million people dead in no time flat and the worst horrors that were ever perpetrated on people maybe, because there's no shortage of perpetrated horrors
