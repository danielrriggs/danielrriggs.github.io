 You're looking at the world you're a creature of action you have to be a creature of action because you have to act in Order to live because if you don't act Well, then you fall apart and you're overwhelmed by despair and negative emotion and you starve to death and you die and so Not acting not an option So unless you willing to take the consequences. I just described so you better look at the world as a place to act and so How do you act well you're somewhere? You should know where you are by the way That that's very helpful psychologically You know imagine you have a map you're in a car, and you don't know where you are You're trying to get somewhere the maps not helpful because you don't know where you are and so even if you know where you're going But you don't know where you are the map isn't useful and the same applies the same really does apply to your life If you don't know where you are it's very hard to map out where you're going
