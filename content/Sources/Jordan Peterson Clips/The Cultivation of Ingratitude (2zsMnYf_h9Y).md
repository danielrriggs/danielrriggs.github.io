 What we are experiencing is the cultivation of ingratitude. And that, as I say often, you get a BA in ingratitude, you get a master's in ingratitude, and a PhD in ingratitude. Dennis, the phrase that you just used, the cultivation of ingratitude, this ties in so beautifully with the text in chapter 11, specifically because what is it that the Jews do differently this time than before? When they're asking for water, when they're asking for food. Before, it was like, OK, they're actually thirsty. OK, they're actually hungry. The language in the Bible here is really fascinating. So it says in chapter 11, verse 4, it says, the rabble and their midst began to have strong cravings. Now, the actual Hebrew is that they began to hit avu ta'ava, right? It's a doubling of the word whenever that happens. That's an intensification in Hebrew. So the basic idea is they are cultivating a craving. It's the craving that's to blame. They're not saying, we want meat because we're hungry for meat. They're saying, we are going to cultivate ingratitude. We're going to cultivate a craving. And so that's what makes most people angry. It's kind of a consumerism.
