 I did an interview years ago and the person said, who's funnier, men or women? And I said, well, I think men are. I think it's based on them trying to have sex, essentially. So they had to exercise that muscle a little bit. But I know many female comedians that are funnier than anybody, any guy ever went to high school with. That then turned into Adam Corliss said women weren't funny. There's been a couple of things I've said that have been blown up in the press, you know, and they were exaggerations of the sort that you're describing taken out of context. I think that in the current climate, if you've ever said anything reprehensible on public record, that you will be slaughtered for it. And so if you haven't been slaughtered for it, the probability that you haven't said anything reprehensible is pretty damn high.
