 Well, how did you learn that discipline was a precondition for freedom? Look, there's just some people that are just way talented. Right. They could show up, you know, three minutes before a run or three minutes before we do a shooting competition and they could just walk through it. No problem. Right. That's great for them. It wasn't me. I'm not that great at anything. But I saw other guys that might not be a great at anything either, but they worked hard. They showed up to work early. They did the drills that they were supposed to do. They had discipline. In any field of enterprise, there are people who are phenomenally gifted. And then if they work really hard, they're even more phenomenally gifted. Right. Those are the people who break records. But that tell it apart, hard work actually works. And with virtually everything, it might not make you the best at whatever it is you're pursuing, but it will certainly make you better than you are.
