 We have two fundamental emotional systems, one positive and one negative. They're not opposites exactly. They're actually separate biological systems. So some people can be extroverted, which means they're quite happy and assertive. They smile a lot, they laugh a lot, they tell a lot of jokes, they like to party. They always like to be around people. That's an extroverted person. And they can also be unhappy, worried, anxious, depressed, frustrated, disappointed. I mean, living with someone like that is quite a trip because they're just all over the place. But there are people like that because you can be high in negative emotion and you can be high in positive emotion. Or low in both or whatever. And it's useful to know that. It's useful to know that about your partner and about the people around you.
