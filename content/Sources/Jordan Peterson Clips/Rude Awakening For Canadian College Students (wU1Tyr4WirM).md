 Everyone listening, you bloody well better listen to this people, because we're entering a situation where the universities themselves are required to ensure that your physicians and your psychologists are of a particular political stripe, which essentially means radically left, not just left, but radically left, like social justice, full, woke, critical racist theory, oppressive, patriarchal narrative, feminist left wing, or the institution itself will not be allowed to train physicians or psychologists. And I know that sounds like a conspiracy theory, and well, go look it up for yourself and see if it's true, because it's true right down to the last word. And so if you Canadians, you think you're gonna be served well by craven political ideologues, who are primarily selected to be physicians on the basis of their political purity, you've got a bloody another thing coming.
