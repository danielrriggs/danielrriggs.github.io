 Comedians are canaries in the coal mine, man. When comedians start censoring themselves, you know something's gone wrong. They're the first line. I think they're out there in front of the artists. That's my sense of popular culture. The first people to go are the comedians. They take risk with speech. That's part of it. And it's, it's, there has to be a spontaneity and a daring. So they're always testing the limits of what's acceptable in speech. And they're almost always doing it in a way that points to uncomfortable truths of one form or another. Things that people won't admit, things that we keep hidden in the dark, the foibles of our leaders, you know, anything that that's there but makes people too uncomfortable to talk about.
