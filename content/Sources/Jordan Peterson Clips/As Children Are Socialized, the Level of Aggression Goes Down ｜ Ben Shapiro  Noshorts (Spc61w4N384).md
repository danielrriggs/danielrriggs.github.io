 those three categories of children, non-violent, sometimes violent, and chronically violent, across the board, the level of aggression decreases with age, dramatically. So the fundamental consequence of socialization is peace, not aggression. There's a subset of the violent kids who don't get socialized by the age of four. They're much more likely to be anti-social and long-term violent criminals. And partly that's because if they're not socialized by the age of four, they can't make friends. And friends are the fundamental agents of socialization from four onwards, increasingly. And so if you get knocked out of the peer group because you can't reciprocate, then you fall further and further behind and become more and more alienated. But what's so interesting is that as children are socialized, the level of aggression goes down. Now you see if power was an effective strategy, what would happen is that the most successful kids would become more aggressive with time, and that isn't what happens at all. So we're way too complicated to only rely on ourselves. We're social to the core.
