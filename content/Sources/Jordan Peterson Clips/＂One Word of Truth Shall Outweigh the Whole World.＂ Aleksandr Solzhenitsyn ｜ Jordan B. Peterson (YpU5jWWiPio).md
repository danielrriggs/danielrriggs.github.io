 Once we have taken up the word it is thereafter impossible to turn away a Writer is no detached judge of his countrymen and contemporaries he is an accomplice to all the evil committed in his country or by his people and If the tanks of his fatherland have bloodied the pavement of a foreign capital Then rust colored stains have forever be spattered the writers face and If on some fateful night a trusting friend is strangled in his sleep Then the palms of the writer bear the bruises from that rope And if his youthful fellow citizens nonchalantly Proclaim the advantages of debauchery over humble toil if they abandon themselves to drugs or seize hostages Then this stench too is mingled with the breath of the writer Have we the insolence to declare that we do not answer for the evils of today's world The simple act of an ordinary brave man is not to participate in lies not to support false actions his rule Let that come into the world Let it even reign supreme only not through me But it is within the power of writers and artists to do much more to defeat the lie For in the struggle with lies art has always triumphed and shall always triumph visibly irrefutably for all Lies can prevail against much in this world But never against art one word of truth Shall outweigh the whole world
