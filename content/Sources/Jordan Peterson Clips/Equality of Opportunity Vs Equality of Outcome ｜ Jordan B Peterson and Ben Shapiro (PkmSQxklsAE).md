 We should talk about a little bit about equality too because there's two important there's two important modes of equality that are That that have to be segregated and discussed separately because people tend to confuse equality of opportunity with equality of outcome Right, and I think that it's perfectly reasonable to be a free market champion let's say or at least an appreciator of The utility of free markets and to be strongly in favor of equality of opportunity Which means that you try to remove from the market system any impediments to people manifesting those talents that would make them effective and competent players in the productive market itself Mostly on the basis of the fact that that's counterproductive for everyone the individuals but also for everyone who could be benefiting from their talent Yeah, that's absolutely true. And I think that's inherent in the idea of markets It's why when people use terms like crony capitalism, I always think there's no such thing. There's there's corporate There's corporate corporatism, which is a better description of it crony capitalism is a self-refuting proposition Capitalism and free markets are based on exactly what you're talking about because again the fundamental principle is I own my own labor Which means that if you impede my ability to alienate that labor you are now interfering with my labor So free markets are predicated on an idea of equality and rights and the idea of Every human being made and this is why I say there's a judaic Christian heritage to free markets Every human being made in the in the image of god, which I think is the single most important sentence written in in the history Of humanity and when you abandon the we we tend to think that these things naturally occur This is where you get into the enlightenment argument. The enlightenment argument is that you can just reason your way to these things Well, you can reason your way to these things There are also a lot of other things you can reason your way to including communism and fascism The question is where what are your starting points? What what are the actual fundamental assumptions that you make about human beings and the nature of the world? That you then apply reason to to arrive at something great And this is why I i'm not a fan of the the enlightenment view That just if we start tabula rasa we can come up with exactly the system that we've built today I don't think that that's either historically accurate or philosophically accurate because We see that human beings reach a wide variety of conclusions based on different premises
