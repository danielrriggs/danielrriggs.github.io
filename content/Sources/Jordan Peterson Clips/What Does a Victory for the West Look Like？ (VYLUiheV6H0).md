 Okay, so Putin is deposed, however that happens, and then what? And then we have a better leader in Russia? We have a more trustworthy leader? Yeah, I don't think so. The Russians haven't got a great history of that. And no matter what you think of Putin, it's definitely the case that he isn't the worst leader that emerged in Russia in the last hundred years by any measure. So that's a big problem. And then I think, well, instead of Putin being replaced by someone who could be better, but probably won't be, we'll have a Russia that's really fragmented and that, you know, the country in some ways collapses. And that's a really bad idea because there's a lot of nuclear bombs there. And if you get the fragmentation of that power structure into multiple chieftains, let's say, and a few of them emerge armed with nuclear bombs, then we have a major problem on our hands.
