 There's an infinite number of gender identities. It's like, yeah, if you want to play it that way, that's true. Because the amount of variability in a five-dimensional space is unbelievably large. You could say with no reason to be contradicted that every single person on the planet, in some sense, has a unique gender identity if you associate gender with temperament. Because every person is unique in their particular constellation of personality. And so, if you want to conflate those two things, then you can. It starts to become very problematic when you additionally conflate them with sex. It's like, well, sex and gender and temperament, they're all the same thing. It's like, well, actually, they're not. And the reason they're not is because, to say it again, you need a man and a woman to produce a child.
