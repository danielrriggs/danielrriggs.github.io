 Boy's IQ has dropped about 15 points since the 1980s. And make a case in your book that that's related to fatherlessness. Boys scored lower than girls in the 63 largest developed nations in which the PISA, a set of international standard tests, was given. Boys are 50% more likely than girls to fail to meet basic proficiency in any of the three core subjects of reading, math and science. By eighth grade in the US, 40% of girls are at least proficient in writing compared to one in five boys. Boys who perform as well as girls are graded less favourably. Boys have gone from 61% of university degrees to 39% girls. The reverse percent of boys who say they don't like school has gone up 70% since 1980. Boys are expelled from school three times as often in girls as girls. One in three children in the UK and the US grow up without a father.
