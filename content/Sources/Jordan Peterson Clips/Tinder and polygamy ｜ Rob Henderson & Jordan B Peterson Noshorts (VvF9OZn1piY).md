 I have a friend, he was very active on Tinder for a while and he accumulated more than 20,000 matches on the app. 20,000. 20,000 and he was so successful that Tinder pinpointed him early on and gave him all kinds of free perks and bonuses and lifted his radius restrictions, gave him the Tinder gold app or whatever version of it. Basically trying to entice him to continue to use the app. Yeah, yeah, they wanted to entice him. This is so amazing. They never want you to leave. These are unbelievably pernicious and vicious broad scale social experiments that are far more potent than anything like government policy. He's in Genghis Khan territory with 20,000. That records for athletes, for example, and movie stars have reportedly slept with thousands of women. Yes, Will Chamberlain. And so you see what's happening is that Tinder is one of the forces that's transforming monogamy into polygamy. Some tiny minority of men get all the sexual opportunity. All the rest get virtually none. And that is a recipe for social instability.
