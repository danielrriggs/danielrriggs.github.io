 And humility, I think, is a form of courage. Humility is the courage to take a leap beyond what you know to be wrong. And it's the constant recognition that it would be better to make friends with what you don't know, rather than to insist upon your friendship with what you already know. And I think there's logic in that partly because there's a lot you don't know and not that much you do know. And so if you were friends with what you didn't know, that might make a much more, what would you call it? That would be a much more productive friendship over the long run than the insistence that what you already know is sufficient. And then I would say too, something to reflect upon is that if you're not already in the promised land, then probably what you already know isn't sufficient.
