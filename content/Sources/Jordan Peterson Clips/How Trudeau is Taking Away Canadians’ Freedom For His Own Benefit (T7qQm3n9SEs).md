 What do you think of Mr. Trudeau? So I think he's an egomaniac And I think everything he does is comes back to his egomania Um, even his political ideology you really think about his his expansionistic role of the state um, it never comes back to Serving an individual Objective other than to make him More powerful or his legacy More grand. So let me give you a few examples. So he He Slashed the amount you can put into a tax-free savings account But then he simultaneously increased the amount you were forced to pay into the state savings plan He Killed multiple pipelines, then he invested state money In a pipeline He attacked parents ability to take care of their own children by by removing tax Fairness for families with a state-owned parent and then he brings in a government program to replace it um, so What you're seeing there is you say well, this sounds like these are utterly inconsistent positions and the answer no They're not they're all very consistent in all cases What he does is takes away the ability of business or individuals or families to do things for themselves And it requires they do things through him and through the state and and His ideology is always about creating a pretext in order to justify the state Garnering more control over every aspect of your life How you raise your kids how your business functions what you see and say on the internet he believes the state has to be everywhere always but that's because as as King louis would say let us say more that the state is him Well, you know that that's okay. So let's I got a couple of things to throw at that The first is you know, I think it's a very dangerous thing to attack the man rather than the ideas But you're making you know as a rule of thumb, but you're making a case that in this case that can't be done because there is a personality trait that is uniting diverse policy decisions that isn't Idiational or ideological even it is in fact personal and so my sense of trudeau Initially, I was very upset with it with his decision to run for prime minister because I thought Well, you don't know anything and you're attractive and you can behave well in public and you and you have a charming facade But you don't know anything in any real sense and there's no and there's no indication that you do You're not particularly well educated and you're not particularly accomplished and this is actually a hard job but worse than that The only reason you even have the vaguest possibility of succeeding is because you have the same last name as your father and so and then he ran and I thought well, how do you justify that to yourself because The gap of knowledge must have been painfully evident to him And the fact that the trudeau name you could you could say well, you know, the liberal party came to me That's his justification. They came to me and there wasn't another person that could win on the liberal side and better a trudeau liberal Even if it's a consequence of family name than any damn conservative, let's say but I still saw it as a manifestation of a really profound narcissism. I think a reasonable person would have said I'm not prepared for this certainly not yet and i'm not the man that need that there needs to be in this position and so I don't know what you think about those musings, but that's how I looked at trudeau and I certainly haven't seen anything in the preceding years that Has disabused me of any of those notions I mean, I think there's some truth in that he is his victory was definitely not a meritocratic one He was probably the least vetted Prime ministerial candidate in our history the media just glossed over so much of his life To go straight to help him and protect him. It was almost like they built a protective cocoon Around him and uh, and you know looking he had He had dressed up in grotesque racist costumes so many times He says he by his own claim. He can't remember them all I mean the average politician had done that once it would have been exposed and that person would have been expelled from politics altogether you know, but uh, you know, he he had run as a middle class champion even that while he Sheltered the millions he inherited from his grandfather and a tax preferred trust fund all these things would have been front and center in the public Sphere had it been anyone other than a trudeau And but he was protected by by the media who still protect him because he really is their Camp candidate he he represents the political class and the establishment in canada Uh those who profit off a big bloated bureaucracy and regulatory state in the the old upper canada aristocracy Know that he he will always deliver for them and he has he's delivered he's delivered mightily for them That's why they're doing so well and that's why they'll fight tooth and nail to keep them there Why do you think he was and still remains attractive to a substantial subset of canadians? I mean people seem to regard him as Charming and caring and I think he is charming in a in a kind of shallow sense but it isn't obvious to me at all that he's caring but he he he seems to play the part and he plays it well enough so that while many people and this is true of people all over the world certainly by the By the act so why do you think that is and? And how do you combat that? Yeah, look, he is charming. I won't deny that Um, and he's a good looking dude But I don't think he's actually that popular. So people people forget he got He got 32 percent of the vote in the last election 68 percent of those who cast ballots voted against him That's the lowest he got he got the lowest share of vote of any prime minister In canadian history and before him the record was set By him in the previous election. He got 33 percent of the vote He never actually reached the height the vote share that harper got in 2011 So we we sometimes we think he's an extremely popular guy because of the adulation he gets from the mainstream media But in fact, he's not that popular with ordinary canadians what he he succeeded at doing to his credit Is engineering a very efficient distribution of votes so that with 32 percent of the vote I think he got something like 45 or 46 percent of the seats Um, and that is the nut we need to crack. He wins a lot of seats with with with few votes We win few seats with lots of votes. In fact the last two elections conservatives have beat him In the popular vote. We just haven't got them in the right places So we need to we need that's the change we need to make and I believe we will make in the fourth coming election So you don't think that it is a Proponderance of canadians who have had the wool pulled over the rise. It's no he's not by look by any objective Analysis of the data. He's not an especially popular prime minister Um, and in fact, he's probably more on the side of an unpopular prime minister
