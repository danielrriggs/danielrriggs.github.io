 in which countries are women most likely to post sort of sexually provocative images of themselves on the internet and on social media. So the researchers, you know, they put forth various hypotheses. One of them was maybe it's patriarchy, maybe in cultures where women are treated very poorly. They feel like they have to present themselves in a certain way, very sexually provocative poses and so on. But that's not what the researchers found. What they found was that in countries where income inequality tends to be high, that's when women are most likely to post sexy selfies. And their conclusion here was that when women are competing for a shrinking number of highly successful men, they're more likely to pose in provocative ways on the internet in the hopes of capturing their attention, which is maybe what we're seeing on, you know, on Instagram and on various other social media apps where I think there is this sort of tilting towards more and more pornographic adjacent content in the hopes of capturing more attention. So I think that a lot of what we're seeing may be due to sort of this overlooked topic of the sexual dynamics in society.
