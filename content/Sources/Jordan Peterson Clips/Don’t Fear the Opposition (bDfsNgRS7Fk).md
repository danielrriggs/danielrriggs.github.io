 It looks like I'm faced by an overwhelming opposition, but simply not true. I just wrote an article for the Telegraph, which was the most devastating article I could write. I thought I was done for by writing it. I basically called for the jailing of the butchering surgeons who are doing gender reassignment surgery, so-called, on minors. And I called the American Psychological Association a pack of spineless, cowardly liars. And that's pretty cut and dried, I would say. And all of the comments are positive. And so there's a tiny minority of people who take issue with what I say from time to time, and they're very noisy. And many of them are journalists, especially female British journalists, as it turns out. But what that seems to manifest itself in the public domain is nothing. I've had no protests to speak of on this tour. We've gone to 60 cities, I think, in three months. A handful of protesters.
