 I was thinking about the issue of discrimination in relationship to sex because I've been thinking a lot about discrimination lately because everybody thinks discrimination is a bad idea which is a very stupid proposition because you're discriminating all the time and the most fundamental form of discrimination is choice of sexual partner and so you might say, well why should that even be allowed? because it is the most fundamental form of discrimination so for example, almost everyone is racially prejudiced when it comes to sexual partners do you use age as an exclusionary criteria? probably, do you use physical attractiveness? only insofar as you're able right, you use it completely if you could get away with it roughly speaking, but you can't because the most attractive people aren't going to be anywhere near you so you can't do it, but you'd like to health, yes, strength, yes, wealth, yes, education, definitely so it's unbelievably discriminatory
