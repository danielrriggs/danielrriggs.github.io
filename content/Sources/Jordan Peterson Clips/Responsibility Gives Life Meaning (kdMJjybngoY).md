 Responsibility. That's what gives life meaning. It's like lift a load. Then you can tolerate yourself, right? Because look at you. You're useless. Easily hurt. Easily killed. Why should you have any self-respect? Pick something up and carry it. Make it heavy enough so that you can think, useless as I am, at least I could move that from there to there. Well, what's really cool about that is that when I talk to these crowds, the men's eyes light up. Their eyebrows lift. Their eyes light up. Because I put something together for them. That's what mythological stories do. So I'm not taking responsibility for that. That's what the stories do. But this responsibility thing, that's a whole new order of this. Is that young men are so hungry for that, it is unbelievable.
