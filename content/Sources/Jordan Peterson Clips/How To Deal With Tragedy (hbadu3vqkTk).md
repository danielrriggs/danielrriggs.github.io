 The reason you need profound things is because life is actually a profound problem for everyone. I mean, you can shelter back and live a very conservative existence. And it doesn't stop you from having to face the ultimate questions of life. It would be better if you could, I think, if you could confront them full on. And I think that wisdom, that's what the humanities are supposed to teach, is wisdom. And wisdom is what enables you to deal honorably with the tragedy of life. I can't see how you could think that that was a bad idea, because there are going to be times when you're in an emergency room, and, you know, prone to panic, and to cry, and to break down, and to collapse, and to be of no use to anyone around you. And that's not the right way to be. The right way to be in a situation like that is to be strong and reliable. And I don't think you can do that without being wise. And you can't be wise without putting yourself together, and without knowing something about where you came from, and what you're like. And that's history and the humanities. And so this isn't optional. It's more necessary. If your man does not live by bread alone, and that's exactly the issue.
