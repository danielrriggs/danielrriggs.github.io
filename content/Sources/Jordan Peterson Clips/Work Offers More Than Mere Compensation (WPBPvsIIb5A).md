 Are people relieved and happy to be living a life absent the demands of economic necessity? Well, the answer to that isn't obvious, you know. I mean, I've seen lots of people transition out of the workplace into a life of leisure and then just perish. Work is not merely what moves bread from the store to your plate and from the plate to your mouth. It's also, for many, many people, it's their prime source of the gratification that comes in skillful engagement in a productive enterprise. And you could say, well, a guaranteed income lifts that burden from people. And I would say you could try that out very carefully, experimentally, at a small scale, in multiple places, and carefully assess the consequences. But we have no idea how much striving forward is motivated by necessary, brute necessity.
