 And instead of just saying, hey, I'm better than you, I'm smarter than you, I can show you how to do this, you can follow my lead. Instead of having that attitude, it's an attitude of like, you're gonna be just as capable as I am at some point. I can help you along the way. More even. Yeah, that's the goal is to make them more capable. And this is something that comes from Jiu-Jitsu as well. If you and I train Jiu-Jitsu and we both been training the same amount of time, sure, it'll come down to like who's bigger and stronger, but I realized, hey, there's always someone that's has been training longer than me and they're gonna be able to beat me. That doesn't make them a better human being than me. It just means that they've been training longer for me. And that applies to just about everything, right? So if the skill of being a seal and planning a mission, oh, I might be better at you, better than you right now, but over time, I should be able to train you and you should be able to, like you said, get better than I am.
