 What else are you gonna do when you're 60? By yourself, in your isolated hedonism, and what sort of sex object are you gonna be then for your hedonistic promiscuity? That's no plan. If you're still an adolescent by the time you're 40, you're a creep. You're the sort of person that you don't even wanna be around. You don't wanna be the oldest person at the frat party. That is not pretty. There's something rotten about that. And I mean in that contemptible sense. It's something that's overstayed its welcome, man. And you know, people are willing to forgive your immaturity when you're 22 or 23 or 28 maybe, or even 30. But man, if you're still playing that game when you're 40, you are not a happy person. And you're going to be motivated to go out there and make everyone miserable. And so grow the hell up.
