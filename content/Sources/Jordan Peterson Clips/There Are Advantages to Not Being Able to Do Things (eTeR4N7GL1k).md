 An old idea, and I believe this was originally a Jewish idea, that something with the attributes of God, omniscience, omnipresence, and omnipotence, lacks something. Well, what in the world can something like that lack? And the idea is limitation. Something that's everything lacks limitation. And that's, that idea, like, when I first encountered that, just blew me away. I thought it was such a brilliant, brilliant realization that there are advantages to not being able to do things. Partly because it gives you something to do. I suppose that's a big part of it. If you had everything you wanted at every moment, at your fingertips, well, there's nothing, there's no story. It's funny, you know, because that happened to Superman. By the 1980s, he could juggle planets, and you could bounce, like, hydrogen bombs off him, and be fine. And it's like, everyone got bored, because it's like you lob a hydrogen bomb at him, and he just brushes it off, and, like, combs his hair, and that's the end of that. The whole cartoon series basically died, because he didn't have any flaws. There's no story without the limitation.
