 What is it that it means to be a man? There's no narrative there. What is it that I'm supposed to do with my life? There's no narrative. So I think we've got to go back to and recover those narratives. And that's why I try to recover some of the symbolism of Genesis. What is it a man is called to do? It's called to make the wilderness into a garden, right? To expand that garden. God makes a garden, the rest of the world is wilderness. What's Adam there in the garden to do? He's there to expand the garden into the wilderness. There's something profound there about what it means to be a man. You talk about a high calling because really what God does in Genesis is he gives his work to Adam. He says, all right, I've created the world. Now I've created a garden in the midst of the wilderness. Now, Adam, you follow my example. You take this garden, you expand it. You use your responsibility. You use your authority. You use your strength. And you expand it into all the world. And my conviction is men need to hear that story.
