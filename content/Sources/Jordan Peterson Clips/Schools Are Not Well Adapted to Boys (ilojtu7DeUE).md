 The schools are not well adapted to boys. Boys aren't designed to sit still and be bored out of their skulls for seven hours a day. There are boys with particular temperaments who are even less inclined to be able to do that. So for example, if you're extroverted, highly social, possessed by a fair bit of enthusiasm and positive emotion, then you're gonna appear more hyperactive. If you're creative, then your attention is going to be fragmented in some sense by the multiplicity of your interests. So if you're creative and extroverted, then you have both of those working against you in terms of your quiescent adaptation to the school environment. If you're disagreeable, which is also more likely if you're male, then you're quite likely to push back against what you see as stupid arbitrary rules.
