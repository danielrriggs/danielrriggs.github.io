 what exactly we meant to be doing with our lives, what we meant to be doing with our time. We all know we've got a finite amount of time. So how should we occupy that time well? And, you know, well, it's funny because I would say in the past, to some degree, that question was answered for us by deprivation. You know, it was obvious what we were lacking. And so when it's obvious what you're lacking, when you're hungry, when you're truly hungry, there's no question about what you should do. You should eat. And if you're freezing and if you're overheated, and all of those things, the desirable future manifests itself automatically in front of you. And in some sense, we've been deprived of deprivation and are suffering from an enemy of prosperity.
