 Your choice of sexual partner is a form of prejudice, right? I mean, maybe it should be distributed in an egalitarian manner Hey, that would be a lot funnier if it isn't a possibility in Huxley's brave new world That was the rule you you shared yourself with whoever asked because it was rude not to and you know what it is Actually rude not to it's seriously rude Now is that something you want to take away from people you want that to be distributed in an egalitarian fashion? How prejudiced are you when you choose someone to sleep with you choose that person and not everyone else? It's the ultimate in prejudice if they say well, that's not prejudicial. Oh, yes It is usually go for the most attractive partner you can find you should go to for the healthiest partner You go for the best person you can find who can tolerate you It's prejudicial in every possible way
