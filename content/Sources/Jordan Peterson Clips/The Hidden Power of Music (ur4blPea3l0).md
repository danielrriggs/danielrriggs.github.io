 When I started to think about music, I was thinking about it because it was essentially, it was an engaging experience that was immune from rational criticism. So it had this intrinsic meaning that could not be subverted by criticism. And so it struck me as something extraordinarily powerful. And I started to understand at that time that the world in a really deep sense is made out of nested patterns and those patterns we perceive as objects and actions, but what they are are patterns in space and time. And that music is actually the most representative form of art because it represents the harmonious interplay of patterns. And then we pattern ourselves to the music and find that, what would you say, existentially engaging in a very profound sense. Anyways, that's my music theory.
