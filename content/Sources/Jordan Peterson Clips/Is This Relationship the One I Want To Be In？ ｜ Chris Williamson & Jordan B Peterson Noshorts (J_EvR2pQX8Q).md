 Imagine that you're in a relationship. It's maybe a year into it. You haven't formalized and finalized it But then one day you allow yourself to ask the question. Is this the relationship? I want to be in just imagine now you're destabilizing your entire future. You're destabilizing your present You're destabilizing your past Because while engaging in the relationship you're acting out the assumption that it's the proper relationship But now you question that that means the story you told yourself about what was happening while it happened Even though it's already happened was wrong and something else had happened and then you have to think through what actually happened so it's unbelievably demanding and the more axiomatic the assumption the more Certainty is cast into into troublesome chaos now. You could say yeah but the alternative is worse and I believe that often that's true But but the thing about the alternative is that you can always Forstall it
