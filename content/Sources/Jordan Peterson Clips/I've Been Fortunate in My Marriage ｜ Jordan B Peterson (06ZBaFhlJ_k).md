 I've often thought that I've been fortunate in my marriage Because you think well you got you get married and you live happily ever after it's like That's not it is it you don't want that even you know what you put you on it We want your partner to do just all she's gonna do is sprinkle rose petals in front of you right and Pat you on the back of the head and tell you how wonderful you are Constantly day after day man you'd be so sick of that after two well, maybe take a month, but But let's say two weeks it be you'd be because you know She should be more on the side of who you could be Than on the side of who you are and if she's deluded enough or terrified enough to Worship you in your current form then well that doesn't say much for her And it certainly isn't very helpful for you you want someone that's gonna Get in the way now and then you know and and to contend with and I've been fortunate in my marriage because I have someone To contend with you know we we have our our discussions, and they're not easy Partly because we have hard problems to solve because life is full of hard problems I want someone who will stand up You know and and have her say even if it's not what I would say Maybe I'm even willing at times because she's quite intuitive And a good dreamer, and I'm more facile verbally And so we have to be careful in our relationship because if I'm in a particularly ornery mood And she has something to say I can usually slice up her arguments verbally You know and then that's that's fine as far as I'm concerned because I get to win, but it's stupid Well, it's stupid. It's first of all that doesn't mean I'm right It just means I can formulate verbal arguments slightly faster than she can but her intuitions and her dreams are often extraordinarily accurate and so We've learned to to some degree to buttress each other's arguments Just on the offside off chance that the person that you were foolish enough to marriage Mary might know something you don't now and then about something important. You know And so what do you want well you want someone to contend with Then it's an adventure you know and then you have someone that you love and that you respect And that's not a bad combination for longevity of relationship And then maybe if you have someone that you love and respect and that you can communicate with and your children Also love and respect her or him and then that's pretty good for them because they've got some parents that they could love and respect That's a good combination you know it solidifies their life, and so you want to contend with them
