 What do you want from your partner? Bliss? No, no, no, you don't. You want periods of peace punctuated by a good fight. Because that means you respect them, means you have something to offer each other, and it means that you're both growing. And so you don't want the fight to be too dramatic, because, well, then you retreat, you can't settle it. But the person that you can completely map, and who only does positive things for you, it's like A, you don't know that person. B, they're not communicating with you, nor you with them. Maybe they're just subordinating themselves to you, or you to them. And you're not growing, you want someone who can... A real relationship is a wrestling match, a grappling phenomena, that you both emerge transformed from. And that's what people want. They don't want to push over. Not unless there's something wrong with them. A narcissistic person, who never wants to be challenged, will want a partner who does nothing but deliver exactly what they're told to deliver. But they will mistreat them beyond belief, and perhaps deservedly so.
