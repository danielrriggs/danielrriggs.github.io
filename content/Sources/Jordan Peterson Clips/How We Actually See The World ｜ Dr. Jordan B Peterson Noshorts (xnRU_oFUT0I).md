 You think that the world is made of obvious objects, and that you look at them, and then you think about what they are, and then you think about how you evaluate them, and then you think about how you use them, and then you decide to act. And that's not the case, because the world doesn't come segregated neatly into objects. And it took people a long time to figure this out, because when you look at the world, there it is, segregated neatly into objects, right? It takes no effort at all, except it takes half your damn brain to do that, right? And we're very visual creatures, we have great visual systems. And so, a tremendous amount of metabolic energy and evolutionary expenditure of time has gone into providing us with a visual system that just breaks the world up into obvious objects for us. And that isn't even right, because we don't actually see objects. What we see are more like tools and obstacles. We just think they're objects.
