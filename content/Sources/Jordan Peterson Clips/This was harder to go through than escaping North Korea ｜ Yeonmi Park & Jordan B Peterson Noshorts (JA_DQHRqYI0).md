 Now I'm with you Christians at 15 studying Bible. And then they found out about what I did to survive in China and the chat rooms. Yes. And they, I remember the pastor was saying, you're so dirty, like it can never be washed. And that was actually a lot harder in some ways to going through all that journey. Because when I was at this point through it, I didn't think that was a bad thing. I thought like something you have to do to survive. Because my father always told me life was good. You have to fight for it no matter how hard it is. And then I'm suddenly now with this mission, it telling me what I did was wrong. I should have died instead of doing something that dirty to survive. So it was very tough to do like keep thinking for the rest of my life. Was it worth it? Well, but also you, you were at that point too, you said that the reason that you didn't kill yourself was because you wanted to help your mother. You had other people that were dependent on you. It wasn't just you. And you were still looking for your sister too. You had no idea what had happened to her at that point.
