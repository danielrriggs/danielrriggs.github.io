 The correlation between perceived mate attractiveness with regards to women perceiving men, the correlation between socioeconomic status and perceived attractiveness is about 0.6, which is a higher correlation than the correlation between general cognitive ability and grades. And I use that as an example because that's one of the most robust and powerful findings in the social sciences. Whereas the correlation between socioeconomic status and perceived mate attractiveness for women by men is zero or slightly negative. It's a walloping difference and that's associated with the proclivity of women to preferentially mate across hierarchies and up and men to mate across hierarchies and down. That's relatively well established cross-culturally and the proclivity doesn't ameliorate much. And then there are other hallmarks of attractiveness on the female side and this is where I want to go with the beauty myth.
