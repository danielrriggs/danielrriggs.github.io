 Men would like to have sex more frequently than women. So that's a sticking point in many relationships. So what do you do? Well, you negotiate. It's like, well, I'd like to have sex 15 times a week. Well, I'd like to have sex once a week. Okay, well, the logical meeting point there would be in the middle. And you also have to say exactly what do you mean by sex? Because there's all sorts of variations of sex ranging from just intimate closeness to full-fledged sexual activity of various sorts. And the various sorts matter too. These are painful discussions often. It's very funny in some sense that people will do and desire things that they won't talk about. They'll engage in the act, but they won't engage in the negotiation and they won't admit what they want.
