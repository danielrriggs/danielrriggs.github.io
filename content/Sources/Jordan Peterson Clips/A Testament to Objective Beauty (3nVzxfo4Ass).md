 I did a paper at Harvard with a couple of my students. We produced a measurement device, a questionnaire, as it happens, to assess people's lifetime creative production. And then we wanted to look at the relationship between various personality traits and their intelligence and their creative ability in relationship to their lifetime creative production. And in one of the steps, we had people make a collage out of a collage kit. And then we had artists rate the collage for its aesthetic quality. And see, if you do that, so imagine you have multiple people rating the same production for beauty. Then you can calculate how tightly related the ratings are. The inter-rater reliability across the judgments of beauty was extremely high. And so you could imagine that beauty is a category that has fairly wide boundaries, but that doesn't mean there isn't anything central to it. And then your claim is that it points upward, which I think is exactly right.
