 Conflict avoided is conflict delayed and magnified. And so it was a cross temperamental learning process for me. I had to learn to work against my temperament in order to engage in conflict that was necessary when it was necessary. I don't think it bothered me as much, but we always worked through our problems until we had resolution. You were very persistent in making sure that we found our resolution. And I don't know exactly what that was about. If it had anything to do with your personality. Well, I think partly, weirdly enough, it was a consequence of my dislike of conflict. I thought, oh my God, we have a problem here. It's going to happen every day or every week or every month for the rest of our bloody lives. Let's hash it out right now, despite the fact that that will make me sweat and raise my blood pressure and exhaust me, because if we could actually negotiate our way through it and come to a solution, we wouldn't have to have a fight anymore.
