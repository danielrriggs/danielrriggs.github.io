 I have had serious discussions with people about a political career. First of all, in my current situation, it isn't obvious to me at all that that wouldn't be less effective than what I'm already doing. That wouldn't be less effective than what you're already doing? Yes, it would be less effective for me toâ€¦ What do you mean by that? You mean to tell me you're having the same amount of impact now as you would as the PM? No, I think more. By a lot. Right now you're having more impact? Yeah. Okay, those are hard jobs and you get boxed in very quickly and they're also brutal jobs and it isn't obvious to me that I have the stomach for it. I don't really like fights. In fact, I don't like them at all. Part of the reason that I said what I said back in 2016 when I first stood up and voiced opposition to what the universities were doing and also what my government was doing was because I could see where that was going. I could see that it was going to generate conflict of all sorts.
