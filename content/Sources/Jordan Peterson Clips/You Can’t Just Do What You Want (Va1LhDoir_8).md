 If you just do what you want right now all the time, one of the problems with that is you're gonna get yourself in trouble and everyone knows that. This is why two-year-olds can't really live on their own because they're whim predicated with no thought whatsoever for the iterating consequences of that into the future. Because people are self-conscious and can see the future, we have to bind our actions in the present in relationship to our future selves. You have to act now so you don't hurt you tomorrow and you next week and you next month and you in a year and five years and 10 years. And that's actually a community. It's a community of potential selves that extends across time. You sacrifice the whims of the moment, so that's delayed gratification and maybe a definition of maturity. You sacrifice that because it's a better medium to long-term contract or covenant with yourself. But at the same time, that applies to everyone else because there's no difference between me serving who I'm going to be when I'm 75 and me serving other people. That ethos unites.
