 The thing about men interacting with men again is that it isn't that they respect each other's viewpoints. That's not exactly right. What happens with a man, and I know a lot of men that I would regard as remarkably tough people, for one reason or another, and everything you do with them is a form of combat. Like, if you want your viewpoint taken seriously, often you have to yell them down, and they're not going to stop talking unless you start talking over them, you know? It's not like men are automatically giving respect to other men, because that just doesn't happen. It's that the combat is there, and it's expected. This is part of the reason why I think men are bailing out of so much of academia, and maybe the academic world in general, and maybe the world in general, is that men actually don't have any idea how to compete with women.
