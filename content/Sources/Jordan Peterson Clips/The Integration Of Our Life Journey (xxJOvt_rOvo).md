 We perceive the world as a place to go from one location to another. So you can imagine that we're on a journey. That's our life, it's a journey. And it might be a 10-minute journey, it might be a 15-minute journey, it might be the journey of a week, it might be the journey of a month, or the journey of a lifetime. And, you know, maybe what you would want is that the journey of a minute and 10 minutes and a week and a month and a year culminate into the journey of a lifetime. You know, you could imagine that you would want some continuity across all that, so that there was some integrity to your existence, so that each part of what you were doing was related in some intelligible way to the whole. That would be an ideal. When you think of someone as being integrated, as having character, something like that, that's really what you mean. You mean that all the parts of what they do fit somehow into an integrated whole.
