 If you breed fruit flies and you breed them so that they don't have eyes, you can do that. You can alter them genetically so they don't have eyes. And then you take the blind fruit flies and you let them breed amongst themselves for seven or eight generations, the eyes will come back because the genome takes information out of the junk DNA and rebuilds the eyes. Even in the DNA itself, there seems to be additional information stored so that the system can revert to an earlier stage of development and then progress forward again. You have 3.2 trillion cells or so in your body and I believe they're working for you, but we have to figure out and give it the right signals so that you can heal disease. And that's what regenerative medicine, the promise of it is really about. We can use customized cell and gene therapy to restore your body back to a previous state.
