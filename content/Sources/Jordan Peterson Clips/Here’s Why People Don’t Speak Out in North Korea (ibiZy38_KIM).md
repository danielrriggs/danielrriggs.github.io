 If one person does wrong in North Korea, it doesn't mean just you are the one get punished. Three to eight generations get punished. So when there was one high ranking official escaped, they killed more than 30,000 people because of the one person's defection. And that's the cause that I had to bear me speaking out afterwards of my three generation family back in North Korea that punished. That my great grandfather, I think, were small landowner before the communism, everything began in the 1900s, only that time. Because of that, then my grandmother's status was down. And the trickiest thing about North Korea's status is that there's not even so many colleagues marrying up. Some other countries, if you marry somebody from higher status, you can go up with them. But in North Korea, there's only going down. If your high status marrying somebody low, you go down with them. That's how they prevent mixing different classes.
