 There's a question you hate. Do you believe in God? Well, people don't know what they mean when they ask that question. What people usually want, Christians do this to me mostly, what they really want is they want me to validate their theory of belief. And they don't even know they have a theory of belief because they think what belief is is obvious. And it's not obvious at all. Like, is belief your willingness to verbally assent to the reality of a set of facts? Well, that's what an empiricist would say or a rationalist. Most Christians who ask me that question are rationalist empiricists and they don't even know it. And so they want me to say, well, God exists the same way a table exists. That isn't a helpful question. It's not formulated properly. And then there's many other forms of belief. You can say one thing and do another, right? Then you might say, well, then what do you believe? Do you believe what you say or do you believe what you did? And I mean, people are full of contradictions like that.
