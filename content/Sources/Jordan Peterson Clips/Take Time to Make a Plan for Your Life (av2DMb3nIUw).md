 First of all, you have to get yourself in the right mindset. You're trying to take care of yourself like you would care for someone that you cared for. And then you have to have a vision. And so the vision would be, well, okay, three to five years down the road, if your friendship networks were configured properly, what would that look like? If you were pursuing a career that would be appropriate for you and sustaining for you, what would that look like? How are you going to educate yourself? How are you going to take care of yourself mentally and physically? What could that be like if you had what you needed realistic and what you needed? Okay, now write for 20 minutes about what your life could be like three to five years down the road, if all of this came together. And then now do the opposite. So imagine all your weaknesses and all the ways that you can go down the wrong path. And then imagine that gets the upper hand. Then imagine where you are in three to five years. So you can run away from the things you don't want. And you can run towards the things you do want.
