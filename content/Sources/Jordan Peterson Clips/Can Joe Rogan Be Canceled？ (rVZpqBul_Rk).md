 I just can't see any scenario short of his assassination that ends up in Rogan not having 20 million viewers an episode in a year. As long as he's careful, like he is, I don't think Rogan can be canceled. So even if Spotify dumps him, it's like, who's dumping who here? Rogan, he's on Spotify. It's not necessarily Spotify might be on Rogan. It's not so clear. And so what's going to happen? They kick him off. Well, he'll just have another platform like tomorrow. Immediately. Yeah. And he'll have all the money Spotify gave him, which was actually quite a lot of money. He'll have way more. Exactly. So I think Rogan is a billion dollar guy. I think Elon needs to sign a 20 or 50 million dollar a year contract with Rogan and start a company like a social media company.
