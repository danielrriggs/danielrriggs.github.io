 How do you solve the Palestinian problem? Anytime they want to truly sit down and negotiate, be my guest, I'll be happy to do that. And I've tried that in the past. But in reality, I took a different track. Instead of saying, first we'll solve the problem with the Palestinians, then we'll solve the problem with the Arab world, I actually reversed it. I said, let's go to the Arab world, and let's get peace with the Arab world, and then circle back to the Palestinians. If they're ready to come before, fine. But if not, let's get peace with 99% and then try to make peace with the 1%, as opposed to let's try the implacable 1% and wait until we get to the other 99%. That's a complete reversal of concept. It's still being challenged. You'll see some of the old guards still say, no, no, we have to go to the Palestinians before we go to the Arab world, and we'll never get peace.
