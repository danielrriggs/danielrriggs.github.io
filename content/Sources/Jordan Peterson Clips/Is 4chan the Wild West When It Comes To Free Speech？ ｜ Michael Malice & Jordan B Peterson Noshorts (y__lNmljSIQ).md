 The rules for 4chan are really crucially important to understanding it. So it's anonymous, decentralized, and evanescent. The two rules are no child pornography, and if there's pornography, it has to be stick to the pornography board. So it's pretty much the Wild West when it comes to free speech. Right, and the fact that it's not permanent also. So it's anonymized and impermanent, which means you'd think, at least in part, that it would encourage a lot more risk-taking. Because one of the things that would mitigate risk is the fact that it could be attributed to you, but also that it would be permanent. Yeah, I mean, that's the comparison of 4chan to, let's say, Twitter, where someone's old tweets will be there. At the very least, they're going to be archived somewhere. You're going to have a consistent username. If you're just going to be like JackSmith37, they'll be able to track JackSmith37's posts over time. You can't really do that on a site like 4chan or 8chan.
