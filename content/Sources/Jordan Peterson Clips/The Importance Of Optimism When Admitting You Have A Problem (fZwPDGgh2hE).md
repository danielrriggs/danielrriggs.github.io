 Well, the first thing you want to do is go look around and see what needs to be fixed. You know, and the interesting thing about that, as soon as you're willing to admit that you have a problem, then you immediately contacted the part of yourself that's at least strong enough to admit that you have a problem. And so the act of admitting the problem is actually the first step to solving it. Yes. You might say, well, and it's an optimistic step because you might say, oh my God, I can't admit to that I have a problem because what if I can't solve it? Well, exactly. So then maybe you won't admit to it. If you do admit to it, you're simultaneously admitting to the possibility that you could solve it. Yes. And then it can actually become something that's optimistic. You can say, well, my life is horrible. It's like, okay, but I'm doing 50 things wrong. Well, great. I could fix those things and then maybe it wouldn't be so horrible.
