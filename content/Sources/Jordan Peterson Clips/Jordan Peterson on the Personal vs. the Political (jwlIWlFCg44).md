 I think the right solution to the most serious problems is to be found at the level of the individual. So I don't think if I wanted to pursue what I regarded as the ultimate goal, the ultimate goal for me is the encouragement of the individual. That's not essentially a political enterprise. It's essentially a theological enterprise. And politics has to be subordinate to that. I've debated throughout the entire course of my life whether I would adopt a political career. It was my initial ambition when I was very young, 14 I would say. But when push came to shove at every decision point in my life, if I had to choose between working on the encouragement of the individual or pursuing a political career, I always chose the former.
