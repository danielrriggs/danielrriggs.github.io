 feminist evolutionary biologists who make the case that women are best served by adultery because they're getting a good range of sperm, you know, and the best suited sperm is the sperm that's going to win. Well, that doesn't, that doesn't count for cheating behavior. And most of the evolutionary psychologists who have their act together take that into account is that what the optimal strategy if you're being cold hearted about it biologically, especially for a woman who hasn't optimized her mate choice, might be to find someone stable at second rate and then cheat sporadically to produce that biological diversity. And that does seem to be something approximating a stable biological solution, even though I don't think it's an optimal one.
