 For the first time ever since records began, 50.1% of women are childless by 30. So there are more women without children at 30 than there are women with children. The first time ever. Well, somebody clipped a part of one of my podcasts, I believe it was where I was talking about what our society does to 19 year old women or 18 year old women, 19 year old women, we just lie to them all the time. You know, the first lie is there's nothing more important than your career, more or less by definition. That's the first lie. The second lie is there will be nothing more important to you in your life than your career. So that's the second lie. And then the third lie is there should be nothing more important in your life than the career career. So that's the third lie. What I've seen is that as women progress towards their late thirties, no, late twenties, there's a psychological transformation. And what happens is that they place less emphasis on their career and way more emphasis, particularly on having a child.
