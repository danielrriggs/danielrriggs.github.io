 Where's the meaning when you read? Well, is it in the words, the phrases, the sentences, the sentence organization, the paragraphs, et cetera? I don't walk through that again. But the answer is it's all of those simultaneously. And it's even broader than that, because you might think, well, the essay as a whole, that's a level of analysis, but it's not. The question you're asking is broader level, because the essay, for it to be a real product, a product of your imagination and thought that will be useful to you practically, and also psychologically, let's say, it has to address something that you regard as important, or the whole bloody exercise is a lie. And I would recommend, if you're bored by what you're writing, you're not trying to answer the right question, or you haven't formulated the right question.
