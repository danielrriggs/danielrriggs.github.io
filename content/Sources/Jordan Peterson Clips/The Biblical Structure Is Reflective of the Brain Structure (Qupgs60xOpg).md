 In many ways, the structure of the Bible is reflective of the structure of the brain, even at a neurophysiological level. And that makes a certain amount of sense, because the Bible was transmitted orally, and had to arrange itself in a way that would be remembered. So you would expect a certain concordance, but the brain is arranged so that not every neuron is in contact with every other neuron, because that would just be, well, that would be a total, there would be just an absolutely undifferentiated unity of structure then, but that parts of it are linked to other parts, and parts are separate in a manner that optimizes both the simplicity and the complexity. And you have exactly the same thing reflected in the biblical corpus, which is also why it's an inexhaustible book. Like, there's an infinite number of pathways through it.
