 Pain, that's coming. Pain, uncertainty, frustration, disappointment, existential catastrophe. In one form or another, man, that is definitely going to visit you. And you all know that because it's already visited all of you to some degree. You're all here and so you escaped sufficiently unscathed to remain standing. And so isn't that wonderful? But you know, it's not over yet. You might ask yourself, well, given that that's the case and existential reality, what do you have to buttress yourself against the catastrophe of that suffering? And the answer to that is whatever it is of value that you've been able to glean. And if there's nothing of value, if you've subjected everything to a criticism so corrosive that you've left yourself with nothing, then that's what you will have when you need something. It's bad enough to suffer when you have something meaningful to abide by. But it's truly hell to suffer when you don't.
