 We're so focused on girls and women's issues. Why are we not even seeing the boys and men's issues that are coming up? Boys are falling behind girls in almost every single academic subject, including reading and writing, which are the two biggest predictors of success or failure. And boys who do badly in those subjects are much more likely to drop out of high school. And boys who drop out of high school are more than 20% likely to be unemployed in their 20s. And so that's just the academic part of it, mental health part of it. When boys and girls are nine, they commit suicide about equally and very minimally. Between the ages of 10 and 14, boys commit suicide twice as often as girls. Between the ages of 15 and 19, they commit suicide four times as often as girls. Between the ages of 20 and 25, they commit suicide about five times as often as girls. And most people don't even know this, pay attention to this, but this is only the tip of the iceberg of the mental health issue.
