 Okay, why should you, maybe you have a terrible father and you have a terrible mother. And you might say, well, why should you honor them? And why should you honor the elderly? And one answer is going to be something like, well, your destiny is to become elderly. And so if you set up your society so that the elderly, the traditions aren't valued, and then you're going to eventually end up in a situation where you're the tradition that's not valued. So there's this hint of iterability there, right? And so you might also think too that that capacity that we have to honor that which came before us, our father and our mother, is, what is it? It's an honoring of the fundamental spirit of patriarchal and matriarchal love. It's something like that. And it's equivalent to the ethos that has to bind us together, not only right now, but across time.
