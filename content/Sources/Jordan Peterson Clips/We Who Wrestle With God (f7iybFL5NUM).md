 People of Israel are those who wrestle with God. And I thought, well, that's so interesting. Why? Well, because we all do that. If you're tilted in the atheistic direction, you might say, well, that's preposterous. And I would say, no, it's actually more true of you if you're an avowed atheist even than anyone else, because you're wrestling so hard that it's become a cornerstone of your identity. You might be antithetical, let's assume, to the religious enterprise, but you're still so obsessed with issues of morality, and about the stories that surround morality, and about the ethics that should orient us, that that's become a cardinal part of your life. So follow God or oppose God, you're pretty much stuck with the wrestling.
