 Beer might be responsible for the birth of civilization as we know it. If you look to Gobekli Tepe, for example, about 10 years ago there was some evidence from this giant site of megalithic architecture, sometimes described as the world's first temple. The world's first temple might be the world's first bar in this giant megalithic site. This, by the way, is 6,000 years before Stonehenge, 7,000 years before the high civilizations of Egypt and Sumeria. But in this site they did find initial traces of calcium oxalate, which points to beer fermentation. At the time, it might be safer to drink some beer versus some water in some cases, and so it could very well be the case that beer is bound up with these ancient sites, with ancient ritual, these t-shaped pillars meant to be the depictions of early gods. It's possible that there was some intoxicating affair there. We don't know for certain, but you know, beer could go back an awfully long way. Right, well we do think of beer as a spirit and alcohol as a spirit, and that's not accidental because it's the ingestion of a substance that changes you psychologically.
