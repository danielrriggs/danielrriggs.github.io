 You don't want to know how many you're asking what kind of underwear you wear. I'll tell you what kind of underwear I'm wearing. All right. I've never done this before. All right. You're going to do it now. But it's funny. My wife bought me underwear with mousse on them. And so I have to tell you that because that's a Canadian thing. Like underwear. Not underwear. Like underwear with mousse. And so I just couldn't believe she bought me these. And they're actually quite nice, which I also can't believe because I don't red underwear covered with mousse can also be nice. But as far as underwear go, they beat the hell out of tidy whiteys. Says the guy wearing a blue tie with lobsters on it. Hey, well, I keep getting these as gifts, man. You don't can't believe how much lobster themed clothing there is.
