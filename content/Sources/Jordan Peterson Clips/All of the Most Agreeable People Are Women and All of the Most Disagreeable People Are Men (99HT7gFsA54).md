 Women are more agreeable than men, about half of standard deviation, and that's approximately enough so that if you took a random male and a random female out of the population and you tried to guess who was more agreeable, and you guessed the female, you'd be right about 60% of the time. But what's interesting about that, and this is something also to keep in mind, is about normal distributions, you know. So, imagine you have normal distribution, so that most people are in the middle, and then you have another normal distribution, male and female, and mostly they overlap. But you see out here, and out here, they don't overlap at all. And so, even though on average men and women aren't that much different in terms of their levels of agreeableness by the group, if you go out and you look at the extremes, they're very different. So all of the most agreeable people are women, and all of the most disagreeable people are men.
