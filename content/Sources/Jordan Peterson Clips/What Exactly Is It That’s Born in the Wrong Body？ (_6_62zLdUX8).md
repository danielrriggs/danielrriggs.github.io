 Well, what exactly is it that's born in the wrong body? Is it some sort of soul? I mean, people who make these claims are generally not on the side of the people who claim the existence of the soul. So what the hell is it exactly that's born in the wrong? The person's core identity, the person's true self. It's like, yeah, that's all hand waving. I have no idea what you mean by that. Except unless it's part of a context dependent story where we more or less agree on the terms. But to abstract them out and say, well, that's not the person's real core self. It's like, sorry, man, you've wandered into uncharted territory there. First of all, you think you know what constitutes people's core self. It's like, really, you really know that, do you? Yeah, well, I don't think so.
