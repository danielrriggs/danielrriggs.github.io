 Hillary Clinton's campaign was treating 4chan like it was actually a person and as if there was someone who could represent it and speak. The Hillary Clinton campaign in 2015-2016 were positing about these sites and like how is it that this is allowed to happen? But it's not the kind of thing where it's like Facebook and you call Mark Zuckerberg and he bans certain users. The users are ephemeral. You don't know who they are. The posts are ephemeral. They just vanish off the board. And I think people who have that bureaucratic mindset, people who have that elitist in the sense that you have this managerial elite running things, they can't even conceive of an organization or a location or a website which is decentralized and there's no big bad vampire to kill. But that is part of what I thought was in some sense, you're documenting something that's so revolutionary that even the people using it don't know how revolutionary it is.
