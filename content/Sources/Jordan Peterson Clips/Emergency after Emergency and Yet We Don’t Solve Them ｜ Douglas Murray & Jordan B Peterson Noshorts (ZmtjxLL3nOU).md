 we're not solving any problems at the moment. It's like the Eye of Sauron. Our society, particularly whipped up by the wretched social media companies that make them rich, have turned our societies into a great Eye of Sauron, which scours across the land, and it looks at one thing dementedly, and then it moves on to another thing. And the problem about it is it doesn't solve a damn thing. None of the things it focuses on. We had a green issue in January. It was meant to be a climate emergency of January of last year. Every democratic government was meant to announce a climate emergency. Then we had the COVID emergency. Then we had the BLM emergency. You know, it's been emergency after emergency, and we don't seem to solve them. In fact, we seem to make them worse.
