 The moral confusion here is that you have many well-educated people who will make very fine-grained distinctions about moral norms in the context of living in 21st century America. They'll consider words to be violence and the misgendering of people to be a profound microaggression, Halloween costumes that culturally appropriate, et cetera, et cetera, or anathema. This is how finely calibrated their moral scruples are over here in the quad of an American university. But you ask them to consider whether someone like Malala Yusufzai was badly treated by the Taliban and they become tongue-tied. They will even say things like, well, who are we to criticize an ancient culture? So anyway, that motivated me to say the smartest, most well-educated people in our society have become unmoored to any vision of objective moral values.
