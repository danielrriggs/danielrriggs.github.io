 The pick-up artist types, for example, they tell their advocates to peacock, to dress above their status level. And the reason they do that is because then they can signal competence that they don't have. Your style of dress is a marker of your social status. And there's for men and for women, there's lots of different ways of doing that because it depends on which hierarchy you want to be placed properly in. You signal with your dress your status. And so then you can falsely signal. And you do that so that people are more impressed with you than you deserve. And so it's a cheap way to gain reputation. And there isn't anything more important to people than reputation. And so really that virtue signaling is false reputation signaling. And it's a form of deception. It's a deep form of deception. And social media enables it like mad.
