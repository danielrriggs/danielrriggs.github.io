 The problem with thinking is that you're a very narrow channel. There's a lot of world and there isn't very much of you. And that means that there's a lot more that you filter out than there is that you take in. And your filtering is very, very intensive. It's dependent to some degree on your embodiment. It's dependent to some degree far more than people generally realize on your motivations and your temperament. And then it's further narrowed by your position in society and by the people that you have around you and by your particular domain of expertise or lack thereof. And then there are sets of darker motivations as well that blind you to certain things that you should be able to see, but either don't or won't. And so the problem with thinking is that A, you're a narrow channel, B, you're not very good at it, and C, you're incredibly biased. And there isn't much you can do about that except listen and talk to other people.
