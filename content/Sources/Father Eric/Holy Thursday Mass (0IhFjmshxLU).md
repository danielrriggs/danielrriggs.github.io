 Let our glory be in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. In Him we have salvation, life and resurrection. Through Him we are rescued and set free. O God, be gracious and bless us, and let your face shed its light upon us. So will your ways be known upon earth, and all nations learn your salvation. Let our glory be in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. In Him we have salvation, life and resurrection. Through Him we are rescued and set free. In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all. And with your spirit. We celebrate this most beautiful evening, the night of our Lord's Supper, the institution of the Eucharist. We give thanks for what God has done for us. He has blessed us in so many ways. We anticipate the cross of Christ tomorrow in His Passion. But yet we look with hope because of what He has given us. The Bread of Life, food for eternal life. Brothers and sisters, let us call to mind that we are sinners and are in need of God's mercy. We pray that you may be saved. We pray that you may be saved. We pray that you may be saved. We pray that you may be saved. We pray that you may be saved. We pray that you may be saved. We pray that you may be saved. We pray that you may be saved. We pray that you may be saved. We pray that you may be saved. We pray that you may be saved. We pray that you may be saved. We pray that you may be saved. Christ is our Savior. Christ is our Savior. Christ is our Savior. Glory to the Lord, and to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. We praise you, we bless you, we adore you, we glorify you, we praise you for your eternal glory. Lord, you are the King of Heaven, the God of the Father, the Almighty. Lord, you have given birth to a son, Jesus Christ. Lord, you are the God of the Father, the Son of the Father. Who has made the world a place of sin, who has made the world a place of sin, who has made the world a place of sin, who is the Father of the right hand, the Son of the right hand. For the sake of the Holy One, the Lord, the Most High, Jesus Christ, with the Holy Spirit, in glory to the Father, peace, amen. Let us pray. O God, who have called us to participate in this most sacred supper, in which your only begotten Son, when about to hand himself over to death, entrusted to the Church a sacrifice new for all eternity, the banquet of his love. Grant, we pray, that we may draw from so great a mystery the fullness of charity and life. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, forever and ever. Amen. A reading from the book of Exodus. The Lord said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, This month shall stand at the head of your calendar. You shall reckon the first month of the year. Tell the whole community of Israel, on the tenth of this month, every one of your families must procure for itself a land, one piece for each household. If a family is too small for all land, it shall join the nearest household in procuring one, and shall share in the land in proportion to the number of persons who are taken. The land must be a year old male and without a wish. You may take it from either the sheep or the goats. You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month, and then, with the whole assembly of Israel present, it shall be slaughtered during the evening twilight. They shall take some of its blood and apply it to the two doorposts and the lintel of every house to which they partake of the land. That same night they shall eat its roasted flesh with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. This is how you are eaten, with your white skirt, sandals on your feet, and your staff at hand. You shall eat like those who are in flight. It is the Passover of the Lord. For on this same night I will go through Egypt, striking down every first form of the land, both man and beast, executing judgment on all the gods of Egypt, I, the Lord. But the blood of the mark of houses where you are, seed of blood, I will pass over you. Thus, when I strike the land of Egypt, no destructive blow will come upon you. This day shall be more a feast for you, which all your generations shall celebrate with a pilgrimage to the Lord as a perpetual institution. The word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. How shall I make a return to the Lord for all the good he has done for me? The cup of salvation I will take out, and I will call upon the name of the Lord. Precious in the eyes of the Lord is the death of his faithful ones. I am your servant, the son of your handmaid. You have loosed my bonds. To you will I offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and I will call upon the name of the Lord. My psalms to the Lord I will pay in the presence of all his people. A reading from the first letter of St. Paul's of Corinthians. Brothers and sisters, I received from the Lord what I also handed on to you, that the Lord Jesus, on the night he was handed over, took bread, and after he had given thanks, broke it, and said, This is my body that is for you. Do this in remembrance of me. In the same way also the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim your death to the Lord until he comes. The word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. The Lord be in your heart, and in the works of your Lord, and in the Holy Gospel, and in the Father, and in the Son, and in the Holy Spirit. Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ, King of endless glory. Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ, King of endless glory. I give you a new commandment, says the Lord, love one another as I have loved you. Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ, King of endless glory. The Lord be with you. And with your spirit. A reading from the Holy Gospel according to John. Glory to you, O Lord. Before the feast of Passover, Jesus knew that his hour had come to pass from this world to the Father. He loved his own world, and he loved them to the end. The death had already induced Judas, son of Simon the Ascariot, to hand them over. So, during supper, fully aware that the Father had put everything into his power and that he had come from God and was returning to God, he rose from supper and took off his outer garments. He took a towel and tied it around his waist. Then he poured water into the basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and dried them with a towel around his waist. He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, Master, are you going to wash my feet? Jesus answered and said to him, What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will understand later. Peter said to him, You will never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, Unless I wash you, you will have no inheritance with me. Simon Peter said to him, Master, then not only my feet, but my hands and head as well. Jesus said to him, Whoever has made has no need except to have his feet washed, for he is clean of all other. So you are clean, but not all. For he knew who would betray him. For this reason, he said, not all of you are clean. So when he had washed their feet and put his garments back on and declined to take a look at, he said to them, Do you realize what I have done for you? You call me teacher and master and write yourself for indeed I am. If I therefore, the master and teacher, have washed your feet, you have to wash one another's feet. I have given you a model to follow, so that as I have done for you, you should also do. The Gospel of the Lord. Praise to you Lord Jesus Christ. There is this song I really like. It is by a band in the property that I heard of. It is called You Don't Know What You've Got. And what is really interesting about this song is that it is very short. It is only about two minutes and thirty seconds long. It has got these beautiful back and forth foals, great vocal harmony, and it is just sort of a smooth, relaxing song. And then right when you think it is getting going, right when you think it is about to be good, it just cuts off. It is gone. It fades suddenly. You can actually hear somebody confused, laughing in the background. And you are too near thinking, where is the rest of the song? And that is sort of how we are all feeling about it. Where is the rest of the congregation? You don't know what you have until it is gone. Tonight is the 73rd day. And tonight we celebrate the institution of the Holy Eucharist. The Church all over the world is beginning to realize what we have had and what we have lost. Now I feel a little bit spoiled because I still have access to the sacraments, the sacraments of the Eucharist, and many don't. And moreover, the three of us at the Church, we still have a sense of unity. So even our priests, who are celebrating the Mass, even they have had that loss. And we feel the loss of the congregation here. It is a little bit disturbing and unnatural to celebrate everything in this way. Without the congregation, it is throwing all of us out of our choices. I realized, I think on Sunday, that this folding week was just going to be unlike anything else I have ever experienced. And so, are we thinking this juncture, this situation, has got to end with us? Certainly not. Certainly not. And over the past weeks, since we have endured the cancellation of public Masses, we at St. Alphontius have been promoting the act of the spiritual communion, the act of spiritual communion of St. Alphontius. And that is really a powerful prayer. It is really a powerful prayer in times like these. It is not just something we do because we don't know what else to do. It is actually an adequate substitute for receiving the Holy Communion in times like these. So, how does this work? We can think of the sacrament of the Holy Communion itself, right? You have got the appearances and you have got the reality underneath the appearances. Now, the fact of the matter is, is that those two are technically joined together. But if, say, some creature were to get a hold of the blessed sacrament and consume it, they wouldn't receive the reality underneath them, right? Because the symbol itself, that is the bread and the wine, the reality itself is Jesus Christ. The reality itself cannot be received by man. And so, those things can be distinct, those things can be separated. The reality itself, Jesus Christ himself, God made man into flesh. God can still give that to you. He is not bound by the sacraments he himself has instituted. When God wants to come into communion with your soul, if you are willing, he is always able to do that. So, even though you may for a time be separated from the sacrament of the Holy Communion, perhaps for years you have gone to mass as often as you could, things can still work out. God can still come to you. God can still be with you. If you pray that act of spiritual communion sincerely, it can be likened to the Holy Communion itself. This is, of course, assuming the situation that you don't have access to the sacrament itself. God gave us the sacrament so that we would use that. The great thing about spiritual communion prayers is that they can be done anywhere, anytime. You can do them at work, you can do them at home, you can do them in times of joy, and you can do them in times of sorrow. God is always available. God is always available to us. And even though we are in this situation, this pandemic is playing, God is still available to us. And this is what God has given us. That's how powerful the Holy Sacrifice of Mass is. It's powerful enough that it doesn't stay here in this building, that it goes out to all who are willing to receive it. The power of the Mass, the power of the Gospel, the power of Christ in heaven and crucified. And what can separate us from Christ? Nothing. Nothing on heaven, in heaven, nothing on earth. Not even the coronavirus. And so all these troubled times, remember this. If you call to God, he will hear you. Let us profess our faith. I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible. I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, born of the Father before all ages, God from God, light from light, true God from true God, begotten not made, consubstantial with the Father. Through him all things were made. For us men and for our salvation, he came down from heaven, and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary and became man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate. He suffered death and was buried, and rose again on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified, who has spoken through the prophets, I believe in one holy Catholic and apostolic Church, I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins, and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen. Let us now turn to the Lord as we offer our prayers. For all priests, may God continue to purify and sanctify them in their holy orders. Let us pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer. For nations and peoples who are suffering from the effects of the virus, may the Lord grant them his comfort and healing. For the Lord, hear our prayer. For the Lord, hear our prayer. For all people who are isolated at this time, may they receive the comfort of the Lord's presence. Let us pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer. For the Lord's abundant blessing upon this community, let us pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer. For the Lord, hear our prayer. Let us pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer. For Peter, for the repose of the soul of Peter and Neva Bachmann and D.C. Mackenzie and David Fetch, the intention of this Mass, let us pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer. Our loving Father, we ask you to bless us and hear us with these prayers in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen. Where true charity is dwelling, God is present there. By the love of Christ we have been brought together. Let us find in him our gladness and our pleasure. May we love him and revere him, God the living. And in love respect each other with sincere hearts. Where true charity is dwelling, God is present there. So when we as one are gathered all together, Let us strive to keep our minds free of division. May there be an end to malice, strife and quarrels. And let Christ our God be dwelling here among us. Where true charity is dwelling, God is present there. May your face thus be our vision, bright and glory. Christ our God with all the blessed saints in heaven. Such delight is pure and faultless. Joy unbounded which entours through countless ages. World without end. Amen. Amen. The Lord be with you. Lift up your hearts. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, Holy Father, Almighty and Eternal God, through Christ our Lord. For he is the true and eternal priest who instituted the pattern of everlasting sacrifice and was the first to offer himself as the saving victim, commanding us to make this offering as his memorial. As we eat his flesh that was sacrificed for us, we are made strong. And as we drink his blood that was poured out for us, we are washed clean. And so with the angels and archangels, the thrones and dominions, with all the hosts and powers of heaven, we sing the hymn of your glory as without end we acclaim. Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts, Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest. To you therefore, most merciful Father, we make our humble prayer and petition through Jesus Christ, your Son, our Lord, that you accept and bless these gifts, these offerings, these holy, unblemished sacrifices, which we offer you firstly for your holy Catholic Church and for all your people. Be pleased to grant her peace, to guard and unite and govern her throughout the whole world, together with your servant, Francis our Pope, John our Bishop, and all those who hold to the truth and hand on the Catholic and apostolic faith. Remember, Lord, your servants and all gathered here, whose faith and devotion are known to you. For then we offer you this sacrifice of praise, for they offer it for themselves, for the redemption of their souls in hope of health and well-being, and pay their homage to you, the eternal daughter, living and true. Celebrating this most sacred day on which our Lord Jesus Christ was handed over for our sake, and in communion with those whose memory we venerate, especially the glorious ever-Virgin Mary, Mother of our Lord Jesus Christ, and blessed Joseph, her spouse, your blessed apostles and martyrs, Peter and Paul, Andrew, James, John, Thomas, James, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Simon, and Jude, Linus, Pletus, Clement, Sextus, Cornelius, Cyprian, Lawrence, Ersognus, John and Paul, Cosmos and Damien, and all your saints. We ask that through their merits and prayers, in all things, we may be defended by your protecting health. Therefore, Lord, we pray, graciously accept this oblation of our service, that of your whole family, which we make to you as we observe the day on which our Lord Jesus Christ handed on the mysteries of his body and blood for his disciples to celebrate. Order our days in your peace, and command that we be delivered from eternal damnation and countered among the flock of those you have chosen. Through Christ our Lord. Be pleased, O God, we pray, to bless and acknowledge and approve this offering in every respect. Make it a spiritual and acceptable so that it may become for us the body and blood of your most beloved son, our Lord Jesus Christ. On the day before he was to suffer for our salvation and for the salvation of all that is today, he took bread in his holy and venerable hands and with eyes raised to heaven. To you, O God, his Almighty Father, giving you thanks, he said the blessing, broke the bread and gave it to his disciples, saying, Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is my body, which will be given up for you. Remember also, Lord, your servants who have gone to their rest. In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took this precious chalice in his holy and venerable hands and once more giving you thanks, he said the blessing and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying, Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me. The mystery of faith. We proclaim your death, O Lord, and profess your resurrection until you come again. Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial of the blessed passion and the resurrection from the dead and the glorious ascension into heaven of Christ your son, our Lord, We, your servants and your holy people, offer to your glorious majesty from the gifts you have given us, this pure victim, this holy victim, this spotless victim, the holy bread of eternal life and the chalice of everlasting salvation. Be pleased to look upon these offerings with a serene and kindly countenance and to accept them as once you were pleased to accept the gifts of your servant Abel the Just, the sacrifice of Abraham, our father in faith, and the offering of your high priest Melchizedek, a holy sacrifice, a spotless victim. In humble prayer, we ask you, Almighty God, command that these gifts be borne by the hands of your holy angel to your altar on high in the sight of your divine majesty, so that all of us who have received through this participation at the altar receive the most holy body and blood of your son may be filled with every grace and heavenly blessing. Remember also, Lord, your servants who have gone before us with a silent faith and rest in the sleep of peace. Grant them, Lord, we pray, in all who sleep in Christ, a place of refreshment, light and peace through Christ the Lord. To us also, your servants, who through those sinners, hope in your abundant mercies, graciously grant some share and fellowship with your holy apostles and martyrs, with John the Baptist, Stephen, Mephais, Barnabas, Ignatius, Alexander, Marcellinus, Peter, Felicity, Perpetua, Agatha, Lucy, Agnes, Cecilia, and Sofía. In all your saints, admit us, we beseech you, into their company, not weighing our merits, but granting us your pardon. Through Christ our Lord. Through him you continue to make all these good things, O Lord. You sanctify them, fill them with life, bless them, and bestow them upon us. Through him, with him, and in him, O God Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is yours forever and ever. Amen. At the Savior's command and formed by divine teaching, we dare to say, Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil, and graciously grant peace in our days. For by the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress, as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours, now and forever. Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles, Peace I leave you, my peace I give you. Look not on our sins, but on the faith of your church. And graciously grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will, who live and reign forever and ever. Amen. The peace of the Lord be with you always. And with your spirit. Let us offer each other the sign of peace. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world. Have mercy on us. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world. Have mercy on us. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world. Grant us peace. Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world. Blessed are those who are called to the supper of the Lamb. Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed. The prayer of spiritual communion of St. Alphonse the Virgin. My Jesus, I believe that you are present in the most blessed sacrament. I love you above all things, and I desire to receive you into my soul. Since I cannot now receive you sacramentally, come at least spiritually into my heart. I embrace you as if you were already there, and unite myself wholly to you. Never permit me to be separated from you. Amen. This is my body which is given up for you. This is the cup of the new covenant in my blood, says the Lord. Each time that you partake thereof, do it in memory of me. The Lord is my shepherd, there is nothing I shall want. Fresh and green are the pastures where he gives me repose. Near restful waters he leads me, he revives my soul. This is my body which is given up for you. This is the cup of the new covenant in my blood, says the Lord. Each time that you partake thereof, do it in memory of me. He guides me along the right path, for the sake of his name. Though I should walk in the valley of the shadow of death, no evil would I fear, for you are with me. Your crook and your staff will give me comfort. You have prepared a table before me, in the sight of my foes. My head you have anointed with oil, my cup is overflowing. This is my body which is given up for you. This is the cup of the new covenant in my blood, says the Lord. Each time that you partake thereof, do it in memory of me. Let us pray. Let us pray. O Almighty God, that just as we are renewed by the supper of your Son in this present age, so we may enjoy his banquet for all eternity, who lives and reigns forever and ever. Amen. I am the most precious of all, the most precious in the world. I am the fruit of the womb of the Lord, the King of the world. O our Father, O our Mother, from the womb of the Virgin, and from the world, who has spoken to us, has spread the word of the seed. The seed of the Lord, who has spoken to us, has spread the word of the seed. O our Father, O our Mother, from the womb of the Virgin, and from the world, who has spoken to us, has spread the word of the seed. O our Father, O our Mother, from the womb of the Virgin, and from the world, who has spoken to us, has spread the word of the seed. O our Father, O our Mother, from the womb of the Virgin, and from the world, who has spoken to us, has spread the word of the seed. O our Father, O our Mother, from the womb of the Virgin, has spread the word of the seed. And the blood of Christ, and the sense of the Lord, has been enough to close the heart of the Lord. So much is the sacrament of the Virgin, and the ancient document of the new birth of the Virgin, and the faith and the trust of the Lord, and the sense of the Lord, and the faith and the trust of the Lord, and the faith and the trust of the Lord. We thank you, O our Father, O our Father, for the birth of our Father, and the birth of our Father, and the birth of our Father, Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
