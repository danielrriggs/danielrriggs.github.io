He shall be raised high and greatly exalted. Even as many were amazed at him, so marred was his look beyond human semblance and his appearance beyond that of the sons of man. So shall he startle many nations. Because of him, kings shall stand speechless. For those who have not been told shall see. Those who have not heard shall ponder it. Who would believe what we had heard? To whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? He grew up like a sapling before him, like a shoot from the parched earth. There was in him no stately bearing to make us look at him, nor appearance that would attract us to him. He was spurned and avoided by people, a man of suffering, accustomed to infirmity. Of those from whom people hide their faces, spurned and we held him in no esteem. Yet it was our infirmities that he bore, our sufferings that he endured, while we thought of him as stricken, as one smitten by God and afflicted. But he was pierced for our offenses, crushed for our sins. Upon him was the chastisement that makes us full. By his stripes we were healed. We had all gone astray like sheep, each following his own way. But the Lord laid upon him the guilt of us all. Though he was harshly treated, he submitted and opened not his mouth, like a lamb led to the slaughter, or a sheep before the sheers. He was silent and opened not his mouth. Oppressed and condemned, he was taken away. And who would have thought any more of his destiny, when he was cut off from the land of the living and smitten for the sin of his people. A grave was assigned to him among the wicked, and a burial place with evildoers, though he had done no wrong, nor spoken any falsehood. But the Lord was pleased to crush him in infirmity. If he gives his life as an offering for sin, he shall see his descendants in a long life, and the will of the Lord shall be accomplished through him. Because of his affliction, he shall see the light in fullness of days. Through his suffering, my servant shall justify many, and their guilt he shall bear. Therefore, I will give him his portion among the great, and he shall divide the spoils with the mighty, because he surrendered himself to death, and was counted among the wicked. And she shall take away the sins of many, and win pardon for their offenses. The word of the Lord. Thank you. Father, into your hands I commend my spirit. In you, O Lord, I take refuge. Let me never be put to shame. Into your hands I commend my spirit. You will redeem me, O Lord, O faithful God. For all my foes, I am an object of reproach, a laughing stock to my neighbors, and a dread to my friends. They who see me abroad flee from me. I am forgotten, like the unremembered dead. I am like a dish that is broken. But my trust is in you, O Lord. I say you are my God. Into your hands I commend my spirit. Deliver me from the clutches of my enemies, and my persecutors. Let your face shed upon your servant. Save me in your kindness. Take courage and be stout-hearted. All you who hope in the Lord. Father, into your hands I commend my spirit. A reading from the Letter to the Hebrews. Brothers and sisters, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has similarly been tested in every way, yet without sin. So let us confidently approach the throne of grace to receive mercy and to find grace for timely help. In the days when Christ was in the flesh, he offered prayers and supplications with loud cries and tears to the one who was able to save him from death. And he was heard because of his reverence. Son though he was, he learned obedience from what he suffered. And when he was made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him. The word of the Lord. Christ became obedient to the point of death, பечно ecos helmet gallon resembles 2 znaczy k nie exalted him and bestowed on him the name which is above every other name. The Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ according to John. Jesus went out with his disciples across the Kidron Valley to where there was a garden into which he and his disciples entered. Judas, his betrayer, also knew the place because Jesus had often met there with his disciples. So Judas got a band of soldiers and guards from the chief priests and the Pharisees and went there with lanterns torches and weapons. Jesus, knowing everything that was going to happen to him, went out and said to them, Whom are you looking for? They answered him, Jesus the Nazarene. He said to them, I am. Judas, his betrayer, was also with them. When he said to them, I am, they turned away and fell to the ground. So he again asked them, Whom are you looking for? They said, Jesus the Nazarene. Jesus answered, I told you that I am. So if you are looking for me, let these men go. This was to fulfill what he had said, I have not lost any of those you gave me. Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, struck the high priest's slave, and cut off his right ear. The slave's name was Malchus. Jesus said to Peter, Put your sword into its scabbard. Shall I not drink the cup that the father gave me? So the band of soldiers, the tribune, and the Jewish guards seized Jesus, bound him, and brought him to Annas first. He was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. It was Caiaphas who had counseled the Jews that it was better that one man should die rather than the people. Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. Now the other disciple was known to the high priest, and he entered the courtyard of the high priest with Jesus. But Peter stood at the gate outside. So the other disciple, the acquaintance of the high priest, went out and spoke to the gatekeeper and brought Peter in. Then the maid who was the gatekeeper said to Peter, You are not one of these man's disciples, are you? He said, I am not. Now the slaves and the guards were standing around a charcoal fire that they had made because it was cold and were warming themselves. Peter was also standing there keeping warm. The high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his doctrine. Jesus answered him, I have spoken publicly to the world. I have always taught in a synagogue or in the temple area where all the Jews gather. And in secret I have said nothing. Why ask me? Ask those who heard me what I said to them. They know what I said. When he had said this, one of the temple guards standing there struck Jesus and said, Is this the way you answer the high priest? Jesus answered him, If I have spoken wrongly, testify to the wrong. But if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me? Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas, the high priest. Now Simon Peter was standing there keeping warm and they said to him, You are not one of his disciples, he denied it and said, I am not. One of the slaves of the high priest, a relative of the one whose ear Peter had cut off, said, Didn't I see you in the garden with him? Again Peter denied it and immediately the cock crowed. Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium. It was morning and they themselves did not enter the praetorium in order not to be defiled so that they could eat the Passover. So Pilate came out to them and said, What charge do you bring against this man? They answered and said to him, If he were not a criminal, we would not have handed him over to you. At this Pilate said to them, Take him yourselves and judge him according to your law. The Jews answered him, We do not have the right to execute anyone. In order that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, that he said indicating the kind of death he would die. So Pilate went back into the praetorium and summoned Jesus and said to him, Are you the king of the Jews? Jesus answered, Do you say that this on your own or have others told you about me? Pilate answered, I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests handed you over to me. What have you done? Jesus answered, My kingdom does not belong to this world. If my kingdom did belong to this world, my attendants would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. But as it is, my kingdom is not here. So Pilate said to them, Then you are a king? Jesus answered, You say I am a king. For this I was born and for this I came into the world to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice. Pilate said to him, What is truth? When he had said this, he went out to the Jews and said to them, I find no guilt in him, but you have a custom that I release one prisoner to you at Passover. Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews? They cried out again, Not this one, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a revolutionary. Then Pilate took Jesus and had him scourged and the soldiers wove a crown of thorns and placed it on his head and clothed him in a purple cloak. And they came to him and said, Hail, King of the Jews. And they struck him repeatedly. Once more Pilate went out and said to them, Look, I am bringing him out to you so that you may know that I find no guilt in him. So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple cloak. And Pilate said to them, Behold the man. When the chief priests and the guards saw him, they cried out, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate said to them, Take him yourselves and crucify him. I find no guilt in him. The Jews answered, We have a law and according to that law he ought to die because he made himself the son of God. Now when Pilate heard this statement, he became even more afraid and went back into the Praetorium and said to Jesus, Where are you from? Jesus did not answer him. So Pilate said to him, Do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have the power to release you and I have the power to crucify you? Jesus answered him, You would have no power over me if it had not been given to you from above. For this reason, the one who handed me over to you has the greater sin. Consequently, Pilate tried to release him, but the Jews cried out, If you release him, you are not a friend of Caesar. Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar. When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and seated him on the judgment judge's bench in the place called Stone Pavement in Hebrew, Gavatha. It was preparation day for Passover and it was about noon and he said to the Jews, Behold your king. They cried out, Take him away, take him away, crucify him. Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar. Then they handed him over to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and carrying the cross himself, he went out to what is called the place of the skull in Hebrew, Golgotha. There they crucified him and with him two others, one on either side with Jesus in the middle. Pilate also had an inscription written and put on the cross. It read, Jesus the Nazarene, the king of the Jews. Now many of the Jews read this inscription because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek. So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Do not write the king of the Jews, but he said, I am the king of the Jews. What Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written. When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four shares, a share for each soldier. They also took his tunic, but the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from the top down. So they said to one another, Let's not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it will be. In order that the passage of scripture might be fulfilled, that says, they divided my garments among them and for my vesture they cast lots. This is what the soldiers did. Standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleopas and Mary of Magdala. When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple there whom he loved, he said to his mother, Woman, behold your son. And then he said to the disciple, Behold your mother. And from that hour the disciple took her into his home. After this, aware that everything was now finished, in order that the scripture might be fulfilled, Jesus said, I thirst. There was a vessel filled with common wine. So they put a sponge soaked in the wine on a spring of hyssop and put it up to his mouth. When Jesus had taken the wine, he said, It is finished. And bowing his head, he handed over the spirit. Now since it was preparation day, in order that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the Sabbath, for the Sabbath day of that week was a solemn one, the Jews asked Pilate that their legs be broken and that they be taken down. So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and then of the other one who was crucified with Jesus. But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. But one soldier thrust his lance into his side and immediately blood and water flowed out. An eyewitness has testified and his testimony is true. He knows that he is speaking the truth, so that you also may come to believe. For this happened that the scripture passage might be fulfilled. Not a bone of it will be broken. And again, another passage that says, They will look upon him whom they have pierced. After this, Joseph of Arimathea, secretly a disciple of Jesus for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate if he could remove the body of Jesus, and Pilate permitted it. So he came and took his body. Nicodemus, the one who had first come to him at night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about 100 pounds. They took the body of Jesus and bound it with burial cloths along with the spices according to the Jewish burial custom. Now in the place where he had been crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been buried. So they laid Jesus there because of the Jewish preparation day, for the tomb was close at hand. The gospel of the Lord. Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ. There are many beautiful things in this reading today, and the one that reflects me in my heart is that they looked upon him whom they have pierced. And to be pierced means that your life is totally taken away from you. Every drop of blood has been shed from his body. And again, the heart is the last to stop thriving. So our first reading offers us the last of the suffering servant songs by Isaiah, and serves as a summary of the servant's life. And that servant again was looked upon as being the nation of Israel, or a holy and righteous man. Certainly not Jesus to come because he was centuries away. And Isaiah might have been considered to be part of that group. And the church has always believed in the suffering servant to be Jesus Christ. He more than anyone else fits the description who he was and what he accomplished, our salvation. And it came about from the cross after his side was pierced, he was taken down and placed in the tomb. And we know the story. Raised from the dead. And that's why this season is so powerfully important in preparation for the resurrection. And one day ours will happen, we pray. So the chastisement was placed upon him so that he could be made whole again. By his stripes we were healed. And he was treated very, very harshly. The most cruel of all ways to be murdered would be the cross and crucifixion. So thus by his suffering we are restored as a new people. And double purpose is that to atone for our sins and to heal our brokenness is exactly what he did. Because he loved us so much and he carried out his father's will. So the servants self-sacrifice awakened the people from their sleep. He inspired them to become as God has always wanted them to be. And truly this world is full of suffering and especially today as we look at the things that are happening. So the last song brings the people to a new life in the Lord. They are redeemed and they are healed. They're pride and arrogance. And they are prepared to serve God as the servant did, the suffering servant who truly was Jesus Christ himself. So thus from childhood to death we too are called to serve God. And all this is because of Christ's suffering, his death and resurrection. And by carrying his cross we are able to carry our crosses. And some are small and some are very, very large. Though he was innocent he took upon himself our sins. For this he was glorified. And as the suffering servant Jesus fulfilled the father's will. And he did it and carried out exactly as the Lord had planned to bring about our salvation. So by living a total surrender of heavenly values the servant showed the nations what they should be doing with their lives. And that's you and I today reach out to our brothers and sisters to be merciful and kind and forgiving and all these other beautiful virtues. So too with Jesus by his merits we too are able to live a life ordered to the end. And that end is the glorified body. But now we must suffer to gain the glory and so much a part of this world. And yes we look at the little children in the womb who truly are carrying their crosses. And some will be crucified today and die. And some will be born because of your prayers. And on and on we go. So again through his suffering many are justified. And by suffering we become more and more like Christ. We take on Christ as Saint Paul has spoken in so many ways. He died with Christ and rose with Christ. And we can do these things as he did because we have the grace of the sacraments and the church and the word of God proclaimed. And Jesus Christ's sac of which we unite with his sufferings. So it is important we call like Christ endure trials and hold out to the end, repeating his words, it is finished. And therefore as we walk this day with Christ, let our journey end at the cross. That we too may merit a crown of glory. That in our suffering we resemble Christ in all of his suffering. And unite our sufferings with him on behalf of his body the church. And truly nothing was lacking. We unite our sufferings with him so that in our weakness like Christ we become strong. And for the cross the answers to suffering are revealed. And good came from it. And good will come from our suffering too. So the glory of heaven is worth all the sufferings in this world. As we venerate across this day, let our kiss not be that of Judas. Rather let it be the expression total love for Jesus. Let us continue our journey with Christ as for as Saint Therese of Avila said, the cross is love and love is the cross. Let us pray dearly beloved for the church of God.

May pardon come, comfort be given, holy faith increase, and everlasting redemption be made secure through Christ our Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen.
