 Let's talk about something that everybody knows. Everybody knows that church is mostly just for women and children. Everybody knows that when you become a man, you move on to more important things. Everybody knows this, but it's completely untrue. The fact of the matter is, if there's only women and children at church, then only half of the church is showing up. That's why I'm inviting all the men of St. Alphonsus Parish to follow Jesus into the desert for 40 days. 40 days in the desert is a men's fraternity program, spiritual boot camp if you like, prayer, fasting and fraternity. If you're interested in learning more, go to the fellowship hall at 6.30am on Ash Wednesday. This is Deacon Eric Seitz from St. Paul. If you're wondering about this dog bite, free stitches and antibiotics, I'm fine.
