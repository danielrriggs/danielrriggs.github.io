 Happy Divine Mercy Sunday everybody. We had two priests hearing confessions for an hour and a half while our Divine Mercy devotions were going on inside the church and I consider that a rousing success. Something that I do here at least the parish I'm at right now is about quarterly I will give a homily dedicated to the sacrament of confession and you know I'm at a very rather large parish and I'm not you know seeing absolutely everybody the same weekend over and over again like it might be in a small town parish and so I think about quarterly I'll just go over and I'll shake the tree and without fail without a doubt I always get somebody me myself personally I always get somebody who mentions to me that they are hearing confession they're here in confession so that because of my because of my homily they'll just say I heard you preach on this and now I'm here so if there happen to be any priests listening just go ahead and shake that tree see what kind of fruit comes off of it it's always a good thing. We're rounding out the octave of Easter now so it's been Easter every day since Easter Sunday and now we're finally getting near the end of Easter. The church has power over time. Hello good evening Charlie. It's got power over time and it could just stop the clock liturgically it's a it's going to be Easter every day for a week now and the church does this because Easter is a mystery and it's a profound mystery at the center of our faith and so we need to take it slow we've got to take it easy and we've got to to come at the mystery of Easter not only year after year in our liturgical calendar but also you know for in a very intense and focused way during this octave of Easter and in a less intense but still real way throughout the entire season of Easter which lasts until Pentecost which this year looking at my calendar over here Pentecost is on May 28th so ah that's what we're doing here and uh you know slowing down and looking at the mystery of Easter we could come at it from different angles we can come at it from different perspectives and uh hopefully we'll be more and more conformed to that mystery of Easter as uh as the years go on year after year decade after death date we listen to our Lord and we meditate on his resurrection very sad to say that I missed the train on the Divine Mercy novena this year I uh yeah a lot of years I do remember to start the novena on um on Good Friday but I I did not this year so uh just in case you guys were operating under the illusion that I was perfect and never did anything wrong well I'm uh open to interacting with uh any of you who are listening we've got the links over on the sidebar and if you've got a question or a comment you can just leave that in the chat and those pretty reliably make it to me um yeah I uh I had a wonderful opportunity for spiritual direction on Friday uh this week and my spiritual director lives in a small town called Warsaw, North Dakota uh it's hardly anybody who lives there uh but he is a Franciscan priest and he is trying to to get a Franciscan order up and running in um in Warsaw and he's very generous with me and he'll uh he'll just have me over for the day and um he will um he will just kind of let me hang out and I got to do um some reading a very interesting book that would cause all sorts of uh all sorts of talk if you found the right people to talk about it and I'm trying to google it right now here we go here we go this should get us close here we go here we go here we go this should get us close here we go yeah this stuff right here got a share screen oh they changed it uh here we go yeah speaking in tongues a critical historical examination volume one the modern redefinition of tongues so this book is written in a rather interesting way most of these uh historical examinations will start as far back as we have any record and go forward but this one's starting in the 20th century and moving backwards and so volume one I don't think gets us past about 1830 and then volume two covers the medieval uh and probably late patristic era and then volume three covers uh the early patristic era in the biblical uh era and um you know full disclosure uh dr blasser uh who is writing this book uh along with um charles sullivan is uh was my professor at sacred heart seminary and it's only because I was uh friends with him on facebook that I uh found out that he was even writing this book but I was interested in from the very beginning so uh it's going through a lot of uh charismatic revival stuff um in the 20th century uh both like the uh what is it the azula street revival in los angeles in 1906 and then the uh catholic charismatic revival starting in 1968 uh all righty you have exactly 15 minutes to get on here otherwise something bad will happen and uh yeah it's it's a super interesting book uh but not nearly as interesting as ted how you doing oh my goodness that's an introduction wait hold on I'm more interesting than glossolalia because I don't buy that well maybe you're you're more of the right kind of interesting did you have a did you have a good east octave of easter I did I did yeah I uh I got to celebrate the easter vigil for the first time um me too yeah yeah so I mean so I mean I mean celebrate it I got to be the main cell yes okay I understand it's a little bit no absolutely it is it is it is ontologically different oh yeah yeah yeah and there's oh man it was it was great it was great but yeah like this time last week I was absolutely out of gas there was nothing left yeah we we did that we did the midnight mass with all four of our kids and it was like they just fell asleep right not my boy he just sat there and stared at me and blinked really hard until one in the morning it was like and then he fell asleep as soon as I put him in the car I put him in the car and he was like out like that but he did not want to he didn't want to go no the um the other kids though it's like they're there for the blessing of the fire and you know that's really exciting and then then we got in the sanctuary and they just like curled up in pews and we're out so not the sanctuary that's my that's my old protestant we went in the church and gotten the pews there we go yeah there we go the nave you were in the nave we're in the nave yes yes and by the fact that it did say nave you can tell my naivete so there you go oh man it looks like the weather is nice enough for you to be outside huh oh it is yeah the world has pulled out all the stops for this this last week it's just been like beautiful and sunny and we had a cold front cold front blow through so it went from like 85 down to like 75 and breezy and yeah it's been glorious actually we've been warming that air up for you thanks father we appreciate you you take you take the brunt of it as it comes down from the arctic yeah yeah oh man you haven't uh there's been tornadoes in your area you haven't been affected by those have you um no no that was that was so that was about an hour east of here and it was okay i mean it was crazy like we had parishioners that had the tornado come through half a mile from there they're telling me stories they're like the wife went out it was like um that looks like a tornado and those ones like you know she probably means like it's swirly and he went outside and he's like no there's there it is there's the debris up in the air she's like we're in the basement now so i i confess to like a sort of wishing that i had been able to be a half a mile from a tornado and be safe because man stuff like that is just oh there's something about it you know it's like a big you know big thunder like a big thunderstorm that rolls in you're like we're probably gonna be okay there's like that tickling down in the bottom of your stomach that just um man yeah so no the weather's been beautiful and uh yeah it's uh it's been really wonderful this is our you know so we i think i said this this is just we've just hit one year through um attending mass and so it's been it's been really wonderful you know the getting to go to the vigil mass was that was really something i i'm working on this theory father that that that that liturgy is like sorry i'm there's some gnats out here so i i don't know if you've heard this like the definition of sublime is something that like maybe less say emotionally engaging in the moment but something that like lives with you afterwards have you ever heard anything like that i i'm used to more the romantic definitions of sublime where it's uh something that makes you feel tiny and terrified excellent okay i wish i knew where that definition of sublime that i been using in my head in here it will come up with some other term but basically things that like in the moment who knows however much you're able to take in but then like the further you as you get out from it it starts like really work on you and so like the i mean the easter vigil is a perfect example of that you know it's like we're there for three hours we got the young kids we're negotiating all this you know new liturgy for us and so it's not you know there are parts obviously that that are really you can really engage with but a lot of it is like afterwards as i'm kind of like going over in my mind you know what was said and what was done that it really starts to like there's this like all this formation that happens afterwards which not you know i'll just look at my own life you know there was let's say more of an emphasis on emotional experience and so let's say the degree to which something affected me it peaked and then it was like on the slope out in terms of how much impact it had on me whereas these other things like the vigil mass it's like wow i may not really even be able to sort out what's going on latin has something to do that and then but then like i i can look back on and say it's like you know shape so like the blessing of the water you know i mean that's incredible the way it just like ties all this the whole creation and creation history israel's history our lord's life on this earth all of it together and saying you know here it is contained in this one place and you know in the waters of baptism basically you know you water that were there for all these things and so then seeing the way those things like start it's like it's like when i'm there for the liturgy it gets at start it gets planted and then that stuff starts working on me over time it's it's just interesting it's like it's a different way to think about how all that stuff engages with my process of sanctification right it's not yeah i don't know it's yeah yeah it's i mean the uh the analogy i really like is that you know that these uh these sacraments and these rituals will plant a seed and it's like you're not going to get everything you're not going to get the fruit right away you know yeah but over time the uh the potential contained in that seed gets unfolded it gets unfolded it gets unfolded and it uh begins to bear fruit until it grows up to its uh full maturity there but you just you got to put the time and the cultivation into it in order to uh to get that yeah yeah i mean that is yeah that's exactly what my experience has borne out so far it's uh it's it's very interesting and it's also freeing too frankly to just be able to say all right i'm gonna you know i'm gonna be here i'm gonna i'm going to i'm going to as much as i can engage with this you know with my mind with my will and and try to be revered and devout here and then like we'll see i don't have to get to the end of it and be like you know that didn't feel like just like a totally banging easter service so i guess something went wrong you know there's this sort of freedom to just say okay that's what it was and like but then but then i started thinking about them like okay well the most you know most of the most important things in my life and then also you know on parallel like great literature seems to do that something like that too where you know i think i think particularly when i started actually reading goods really good stuff like in college one of the first things i wrote was the odyssey and at no point in it was i i think you know again because you're reading translations of greek and it's like i'm not thinking wow that was like such a great turn of phrase or like oh wow like such an exciting moment but afterwards i started to realize okay there's this thing in my head now that just had another quality from all the other things you know and and and then particularly the things i keep coming back to like the divine comedy from coming back to it over and over and over and yeah it has that exact it has that seed like quality like it's it's a thing in there and then you know 10 years later oh my goodness that's what he was talking about um yeah yeah i remember i remember being in kindergarten right and reading getting a storybook read to be about this little girl who loved lime of beans she loved lime of beans but she knew that none of her friends liked lime of beans and so she wouldn't admit to uh liking lime of beans right and then one day she yeah one day one day she woke up sick she woke up sick and um i don't know uh the parents kept on asking her what her symptoms were and these symptoms would pop up right so if she do you have a fever all of a sudden she'd start burning right uh do you have sniffles all of a sudden you know she she'd had the sniffles and all these things and then they brought in all of these doctors you know and the doctors were like perhaps it's a bacterial infection all of a sudden there'd be all these bacterial maybe it's a fungus and all these fungal spores would sprout out of her you know like all these doctors are just making it worse so then they brought in some kind of a guru right and the guru said just close your eyes and feel yourself at one with the room and then she became one with the room and her like her mouth was the bed and her eyes were the windows i read this book yes yeah yeah and then and then a little old lady brought her some lima beans and boom she was uh yeah bad case of stripes that's right she woke up with stripes yes oh my goodness would you believe i didn't get the moral of that story until i was like 17 years old but it was there how other people's opinions of you to dictate what you think then they're gonna dictate whatever they want oh but it was there it was working on you it was working on you i'm sure it was working on you so this this children's literature is is uh is super stinky important you know okay so this is this is a this is a weird one did you by any chance grow up with the children's book um uh go dogs go it's like dr susa jason's is this weird it's like dog big dog little dog black and white dogs all these dogs and then there's just dogs doing different things okay it's oh man like i i really feel like i remember it but hold on i'm gonna is there am i gonna violate copyright stuff if i like hold it up here no absolutely not okay i'm gonna be back in 30 seconds yeah charlie campbell your your brave admission is uh is comforting to me because but you know it took me years like and i would remember that every once in a while and then boom and all finally uh came together it is a dr seuss okay all righty yeah laura i can't see your hat because you're not on the stream so oh oh never mind it's not seuss my childhood is destroyed okay all righty okay so this is go dog go which i grew up yes yes yes that one okay so like for years it kind of made no sense to me and but like i was fascinated with it all my siblings were fascinated all my kids were fascinated with it and then i think it was probably jonathan bejoe that did this to me but like i'm looking at it and it's like you know there's dog you have big dog and little dog and you're like okay so we have some category being and then we have these fundamental distinctions big dogs and little dogs black and white dogs you've got all these opposites set set up and and so you go through this and it's like okay now we have this like a boy dog and a girl dog talking about a hat and whether or not they like it and like this this reoccurs like she keeps saying do you like my hat and they get fancier every time he's like i don't and then goodbye and you're like what's going on here and then we have dogs going into a maze and so this is like a year ago this bizarre brainstorm i'm just gonna walk you through it i want to see if you buy this sure sure so we've got we've got we have being and then we have let's say poles of being we have different we have differentiation and then you have you have the sexes and you have there's some sort of like rift between male and female and then you end up in this world where you have one little dog going into a maze you have three big dogs going out of the maze it's like things are getting more confusing then you have a red dog in a blue tree a blue dog in a red tree like everything's mixed up right you categories are mixing they're mixing they're it's disordered then you have dogs going around in cars right they're all just like running into each other this car is broken down these dogs are like smashed into each other there's no direction they're going like they're going up and down more of that you have like uh injustice right the blue there's the big dog who's got the house he's kicking the little dog out and then you've got some other stuff some other stuff there's a lot of like disordered things dogs in helicopters over trees in the water over the water it doesn't make a lot of sense we haven't you know here she is with an even bigger hat he still doesn't like it so there's still conflict between them and then we have the wheel of fortune right the dogs are all going around and around and around go around again you're like okay and then we also have conflict with the environment right he's like the son's baking this dog and you're like why why are you fighting the thing the way of the world and then you have this page and i credit my sister for this this is the turning point i'm sorry i'm gonna highlight you that's my goal oh there we go fantastic there we go okay so what's fascinating is is this is the only dude i have no idea how much pd eastman meant any of this but you have three dogs at a party in a boat at night and there's a cross of wood illuminated with a lantern i have no idea it's also there on a party so it's the first time there's any sort of like cohesion between them right they're doing something together yes okay so there's right and what happens immediately is now you have dogs at work work dogs work dogs at play play dogs play right so you've gone from this disordered chaotic thing to organized work and organized play right this is how how people are supposed to interact together but there's still this issue right hold on i don't know if you can see that so there's there's still there's still the hat right there they're trying to meet on top of the mountain but it's not working something is wrong there we don't have a resolution but now the dogs they're in cars again but they're not driving around like mad smashing into each other and breaking down they're all going somewhere together and they're going right so there's there's a telos right they're they're they're headed somewhere not only are they headed somewhere they're also following the rules right so there's i mean like where's that traffic light coming from it's just hanging down from heaven but they're following it right so it says go they go when it says go and then they all stop when it says stop and they all go when it says go again right they're like they're following the order of things and then this one we could talk for like 10 minutes about what my interpretation of this is but we'll just leave that one out they're playing tennis on top of a blimp yeah right well i think it's as one does or it's the fact that christ has despoiled the prince of the air and so now there's even rejoicing in the heavens but it's getting a little weird so now all the dogs are asleep and this is the part where it's like half the time when i read this to my kids i start crying because now it's time for sleep they all they will sleep all night right and what comes after you sleep all night i mean look they're under covers like i get it they're dead they're dead the dogs are dead and now it is day now is the sun now the sun is up now is the time for all dogs to get up right and you have this messenger yelling and he's ringing a bell right father they all jump out in the sunlight and they drive off really fast and father where are they going i don't remember i don't remember they're going to a tree uh going to a tree of course where else would they be going now the cars stop now all the dogs get out look where they're going they're climbing jacob's ladder jacob's ladder hold on to the tree to the tree right it's like further up and further in up the tree up the tree up they go to the top of the tree why will they work there will they play there what is up there on top of that tree and it's a dog party a big dog party big dogs little dogs red dogs blue dogs yellow dogs green dogs black dogs and white dogs are all at a dog party what a dog party wow and then the last thing hello again and now do you like my hat and look she is crowned in glory right she has a crown on her head where all of creation is brought together in this symbol of glory and he says i do what a hat i like it i like that party hat and they go off into the west dang i didn't know what i was expecting it wasn't that and i'm glad my expectations were wrong because holy mackerel i i'm i am i mean dude i have no idea where that came from if pd eastman minted or what but like yeah no no no it's look it's like that's why we know that symbolism isn't arbitrary right yes like it's yes it's not like painting red octagons all over the place the red octagons are useful but we made that up yes but all of this stuff is out there and we discover it yes and then it if our if we really are a microcosm of the universe then it's also inside of us already or as i think equinus would say it's imprinted into us already so that um so that uh basically we just need to make the connection and everything everything lines up it's it's like gears that are meant to run with each other but it's organic and way cooler than machines so i'm almost like could you have come up with something that good if you tried i don't know no no you just because because it's that it's that right brain um not even right i mean it is the right brain i think but mediated by the right brain but it's that intuitive continuous processing that just knows what this book is supposed to look like yeah and like all of the best stuff is created in that way yeah you're not trying to force it you just you just let it happen right why does easter vigil start with the fire people just knew that was people just knew that was right yeah yeah explain it yeah yeah i i just love it so much i just love it so much i'm starting to get suspicious of uh all of my childhood reading right like how much of that had deeply implanted symbolism in there because i didn't start paying attention to symbolism until i read holes you know yeah yeah which is basically a pretty excellent book i think uh we'll probably also be actually oh yeah not a part of your childhood huh no no i i almost read it many times i don't know why i never did but i almost read it many times well i can recommend it for your children uh one it's a kind of uh depending on how sharp they are they might be able to pick it up at seven or eight yeah or it might be a 10 year old sort of thing well if they're like me they won't be able to read until they're eight so well now charlie i don't think holes has uh has the same kind of uh symbolic uh resonance but it's a really tightly written story um it's not nearly simple enough to be to be like go dog go where it can just do everything perfectly um but but what i did notice was and this is my 10 year old appropriation of it was uh was uh you know everything everything was set up perfectly in that book right and so you you get through the whole thing with uh with the yellow spotted lizards and the onions and then the ending makes sense and it all ties it nicely together for uh for a 10 year old there so that was when i first started actually kind of paying attention to books a little bit and then even more when we actually did harry potter books in a middle school literature class um and these things would be the sort of thing where if you've you know studied a little bit of literature they'd be obvious to you but when you're a middle schooler and your teacher points it out it's like whoa oh that was there so anyway maybe there's some uh some more depth the holes that i haven't plunged um if you will yeah i haven't i haven't gone down into the depths yet to uh holes are very deep yeah yeah they're only about six feet deep the same length as a shovel slow it same length which of the shovel that's definitely gotten in your head hasn't it yeah father i read it i just said i read it more than once yeah so there you go have you read a a canticle for libowitz by any chance i have okay you're talking about about tight endings where stuff comes together and that one so i had the very weird experience of the name of the rose and then a canticle for libowitz within about two months of each other which like superficially they're both really weird books about monks and strange stuff happening but i just i there's some fascinating contrast in terms of the way that like the name of the rose goes in this like just insane self-contradictory post-modern like there's no narrative and none of it means anything and i was like why dude you just completely ruined your book and then i read a canticle for libowitz on the recommendation of the same friend and thought i was running into the same thing and found the way that so much comes together that i mean there's just something about that like there's an experience of reading a narrative that is crafted so that everything ends up in this one place there's a sort of like singularity at the end of it and you know not if you i don't not ruin it for anyone else but if you remember when he's like at the very end when the church is collapsed and he finds this and there's like he's talking to the skull there they're just like it's just so it's just so good i also the you know the contention that the roman catholic church is what's going to make it total nuclear war i'm like yeah yeah by now all that decentralized command or subsidiarity as we should be calling it yes because it's like you know what if there was a worse horrible nuclear war and we lost contact with rome i think we would just go back to electing our own bishops you know it's like what else are you gonna do you know and so it's like yeah we got all these uh all these uh uh backups uh a canticle for lebowitz of course uh that's what i just talked about it is it is worth reading um i like how if you if you know theology then the little just the little aside about the dominicans debating whether or not the blessed virgin mary got any of the praetor natural gifts back in the immaculate conception like you have to know theology in order to get that particular part of the payoff at the end yeah giant nerd book uh yeah and that is exactly what it is yeah i was glad i knew a little bit of latin when i was reading it because i could be like okay he's just he's just quoting the psalms there that's what's going on it's nothing nothing all that uh special there he's unapologetic and like the first it's in three parts like the first the main drama of the first third is like the ecumenical or sorry the ecclesiastical canonization process like that's the drama of just like is this guy gonna get canonized it's great and it's and it's fantastic and you know just in terms of all this all this stuff about well charlie your thing about the immaculate conception you don't yeah you will get the plot without that these are just little little jokes that the author put in for giant nerds like me and ted so in one sense it's like the lord of the rings where you can read the trilogy and enjoy it profoundly and and just feel like you're living in a complete world and then you go and you read the summary and you realize that almost everything that was all these side references and the lord of the rings is like a 15 to 50 page story that he wrote somewhere else and you feel completely overwhelmed but when you read the lord of the rings you don't you don't need any of that you're like oh yeah baron and luthien there's a cool story behind that and you know it has something to do with aragorn and it's sort of tragic and also connected and then you go and you read the play of baron and luthien and you know then your mind gets blown but you only you would never sit down and read it and you certainly don't even need to know what it is to like really enjoy the lord of the rings there's some it's a sort of like i mean it's like a correspondence with reality where you don't have to like look at your house and know oh yeah it was built in this architectural style just started by this person and you know on and on and on and on and sure you can add richness to your life but like you can still live in your house and love it as long as it's beautiful yeah yeah exactly yeah wow wow yeah i i gotta tell you what though about a canicle for lebowitz i absolutely enjoyed it my first time through i was hooked i was all in and i loved it and my second time through i thought i've done this already so it's super clever highly recommend it but i it it's like once you've once you've read it once it's like oh yep there's that oh yep there's that oh we've lost ted he's he's no no i'm here i'm just i'm walking i'm walking inside i just i don't want to too many bugs too many bugs the bugs got me yeah the bugs are persistent like that so anyway i'm not saying that doesn't mean you should read it maybe the sort of thing that i would buy on kindle now so i don't have to haul it everywhere i go the rest of my life but i bought it on paperback so my friends that i borrowed had the grooviest paperback cover with these like benedictine monks on hovercraft like going up into this giant cross-shaped starship that looked like a stained glass window so i wouldn't do it expecting that you know like and it was totally different and great but i was like i kind of want my i kind of want my gothic starship many books are like that wait 20 years and the blessing of limited memory means you can enjoy it again you may well be right but i i think i read that one before i was 25 so it's uh it's gonna be locked in there although i didn't remember go dog go very well until you started showing me the pictures so yeah there isn't there's so i think beatrix potter not sort of as diagrammatically as that but um she's she's hitting a lot of similar things um squirrel nutkin my sister and i had a long conversation about squirrel nutkin squirrel nutkin is fascinating um he is that is a very archetypal story as well if you're familiar with it it's the squirrels they go out on they go out and in the autumn to this island in the middle of this scotch lock or northern you know it's actually it's a lake district so there you go northern english lake and the island's got all these nut trees on it but there's old brown who's this big owl living on it and so every day of the week they come and they bring some present it's a sacrifice some present to old brown and say oh mr brown you know can we gather nuts from your island and then there's so there's all the good squirrels do that and then there's squirrel nutkin who just tells throws riddles at score at old brown and then goes out and fiddles around and you know plays bowling make you know makes a game of bowling with a crab apple and pine cones or something like that you know anyway he just fiddles around and then the last day he he gets so um brash that he jumps on old mr brown as he's telling a riddle and then ends up stuck in his waistcoat pocket and is almost eaten but has his tail escapes losing his tail it's very interesting you know when you because old mr brown is like i mean basically he's this like embodiment of of chaos you know it's like he's the you know he's the thing you bring the the sacrifices too so it doesn't kill you so that you can live in the world but what's there's sort of like the easy moral moralistic tale and then there's like a second level of it too which is really interesting which is like squirrel nutkin does escape and this like this sort of balance between that sacrificial life and the levity that squirrel nutkin brings anyway i i think i think that i think that stuff starts working on people i mean we're we are sticklers for children's books on our family we do not let garbage in this house because i'm like this is the imaginative substrate like you start flipping through some of these this modern garbage you're like this is not what you are going to build your imaginative life on absolutely not it's like you know if if if the question is as important as the answer if the framework is important as the content it's like this is this is the feminine i mean that's what chesterton says right i don't agree with them but he's like by the time a kid goes to school at four they've learned everything important in their life from their mother already you know he's wrong but he's also right but he he was he's not somebody you go to for precision yeah yeah he's uh he's he's just kind of shooting from the waistcoat um and that's that's what we that's what we pay him for that's what we pay him for how you doing andrew what are you doing how are you doing all right did you uh did you have easter today um yeah by easter i mean pasca yep yep if we were talking in latin you know it would be pasca too it's just we're american and we've got that english heritage so yeah yeah we call it easter yeah um we had mattens yesterday and then just the service bled into today so yeah it's pretty great service bled of course it did of course of course what time did you get started with mattens uh 8 30 so okay not too bad yeah i got to take advantage of the uh the famous famous brevity of the roman rite and we started at 8 30 and we're done by 11 and i still had somebody email complaining to me that it was too long and we shouldn't have done all the readings it's like uh you know i mean i could read the email but that would be rude but it was like uh they had to get up at work at five and work the whole day it's like well i'll probably give the person a phone call and at least talk to him about it but uh yeah yeah so just tell them the email was too long and he didn't read it you know there are uh there are jobs and there are positions in society where you can get away with that kind of shenanigans where you can just troll people once you got this thing on you got to be mr approachable so i will not do that that father somewhere in my paul vander clay listenings at some point he referred to certain pastors as quivering masses of availability well it's not that which is not what any catholic priest i've ever met is because you guys are spread so thin but when you're talking about having the caller and having to be as be approachable it just does the first thing that i thought it was like i've met those people they're like oh you want to talk to me what do you want to talk about anything you want to talk about it's like okay yeah i mean maybe there's a time and place for that but uh yeah it's uh you know i uh so i got my my clerical shirts and i started wearing them in theology one until like the first time you see yourself in the mirror it's like oh boy this is getting serious now i gotta get used to this right because you know people do treat you different and so you gotta act different in accordance with that otherwise you just be in a hoser nobody's looking for that father one of the one of the two priests that we went to a parish with her not the parish we used to go to we stayed with some friends over Triduum and so there's two two priests at their parish and one of them i was just cracking up because i mean the guy he just like rattles he just like runs through stuff and and i was thinking you know he probably thought all right look i am consecrated to the priesthood i can i can administer sacraments than no one else can and i have like a limited amount of lifetime so we're just gonna crank them out so it's just like i'm gonna bless you i'm gonna bless you i'm gonna bless you it's like you want to go to confession we're gonna we're gonna get everyone through it's like there's just such an efficiency about it where he's just like you could just tell he's thinking like how much grace can i bring into the world with my priesthood like today it's really great oh he was he was moving quickly but he wasn't impatient no it's it's a remarkable thing yeah yeah he he was moving with something approximating the speed the heavens yeah and uh you know i don't know what things are like down there but if they're spread thin you know like right now i'm at a parish with three priests we got a ton of people here but i've got enough time to do the work i need to do and also just frivolously hop on youtube every sunday night so uh i don't i don't think it's fundamentally frivolous for me to have this relationship with you guys but this isn't a part of my job either but uh yeah i think uh i think once i i take one or two steps up it'll be uh i'll be a little bit more like that where more people you know it's like uh like my boss is super busy whereas i'm kind of mostly busy no i mean it's it's so great like you know like we've got a diocesan priest who's covering the three parishes and you're like it's just that's hard it shouldn't be that way like it you know to have that mindset when you're in a situation like that of you know i'm going to try to take care of everyone sacramentally is great but like like that's not that's not all that it is right and like the opportunity to be able to have relationships with the people that you're around and you know give spiritual counsel and you know in all in all those situations that's i mean yeah i'd love to have a couple of sons that are priests and you know maybe maybe have some vocations in the family like definitely definitely would like that like we could definitely use i'm all i'm on board with more praise and letting letting there be a little bit let maybe more more slowness to it you know yeah i mean there was a time when we had uh you know like i think especially like in st paul right um during world war two the archbishop there promised any priest who went and became a military chaplain that they would get a parish when they got back um and you know and like back in the day like 40s and 50s like you were an assistant for like 14 or 16 years before getting your own parish which is like holy mackerel at least maybe that wasn't the case everywhere but it was a case in in like detroit i remember one of the old priests talking to us like yeah you had to be a priest for 14 years before you got your own parish and so they just built all these little neighborhood churches because these priests were promised parishes and gosh if i i just had you know 500 people that'd be nice yeah because i'm not going to get to know everybody that's that's not real i mean but i can know everybody by reputation and face and that's that's all that's all you don't have to do these but because we're so short on priests we have to build these mega parishes in order to fit everybody in uh get people the eucharist and all that yeah so yeah oh yeah interesting times are what they are that's they are what they are yeah we make do we figure it out i've not overworked like i've heard some of these priests in mexico they got to do 14 masses on a sunday no that's no so it's like as much as i might want to complain every once in a while your your uh your priests three parishes are relatively easy compared to what some of those guys are doing man that's against the rules by the way but you know the rules have to be enforced in order for them yeah this guy he uh he grew up in uh in fargo here and he became a priest down to mexico and uh he's got like 42 000 catholics in his territory crazy whoa and then cartels keep on whacking priests right like over 80 have been killed in the past 10 years in mexico so it's just oh my goodness yeah makes arkansas seem real nice doesn't it oh i mean arkansas great i love arkansas yeah that's wild that's really wild father i'm just trying to wrap my head around that that's that's really something 14 in a day that's when you're grateful for the brevity of the roman right that's when you're grateful for the brevity of the story to brevity of the roman right you don't have to sit there and chant for for two and a half hours to do things properly yeah when i get the chance i do sit there and chant for two hours two or three hours but yeah wow oh a supply chain issue yeah you could say that you know you could also say that he who sows sparingly will reap sparingly he who sands sows generously will reap a bountiful reward that's what i'd say so say liberation theology is garbage but oh my goodness that's wild chad chad be at peace be at peace chad oh andrew any uh highlights from your uh uh your your pasca anything you noticed um just from pasca um it's pretty interesting how like the reading mirrors the service right so um we've read um mary mag dylan coming to the tomb and then finding it empty and then mary mag dylan coming to the tomb and then finding it empty and then um she goes to the apostles and then the whatever apostles all run out um i'm trying to remember how like the actual service mirrored that but you know how like we read the the tomb being empty and then we have the you know everyone goes to the sanctuary and then the whole like tearing the veil you know everyone starts chanting christos and sd and whatnot we don't have that but it sounds cool and i'm here for it but we don't have that we do we we do that differently but uh yeah so so i mean you're going to a coptic church right yeah and now do they have the econostasis up between the nave and the sanctuary and so do they put a uh uh a curtain over the econostasis um there's like a specific part where it has a veil um okay yeah is that their year round or yeah pretty much and then you know after um after the resurrection they leave it open for like 50 days ish and then okay yeah okay yeah yeah it's neat interesting that is cool yeah you know and i didn't so yeah with the bailing of the images on passion sunday you know i got the connection between that and the reading on passion sunday christ hiding himself it did not get the connection between they're removing all of the veils from the images in the church and the curtain being torn into that's interesting i need to think about that yeah andrew did you all is the first reading in the paschal service genesis one like the beginning of genesis i don't think so um it's kind of i don't know i for us mattens bleeds into like the actual service so um i don't know when that ends ended and you know the proper stuff again um yeah but it starts with the uh procession i think um so that's me all the deacons come out with a you know giant cross and a bunch of images of the resurrections you know we kind of know what you're getting into did you guys light a fire no afraid not all right well roman rights got something cool that the coptics don't come to us on the east original we light a fire we got a bonfire and no marshmallows just candles oh wonderful um we had candles too um they're all electronic though um you know yeah what can you do that you complain until you get real candles that's what you can do i mean we're we're giving we're giving five-year-olds candles here they got a little you know wax catcher but it's there's going to be some spills it's pretty inevitable um well then when you're like you're holding like two candles that are lit and your missile and almost two-year-old i started melting wax i'm sorry the plastic on those catchers it was like i'm like i looked down it's like black and then melting it's like uh but we when they turned the lights on at midnight in that church there was so much candle smoke and so much incense it was i mean it was awesome like it felt like one of the descriptions that look like you guys you guys timed it so that the gloria came at midnight you know i wasn't looking at a watch but it was somewhere around there yeah and it was like awesome all the lights yeah they start the mass they start the mass right at midnight and which is rough on the kits but it's pretty cool symbolically yeah and it's like it's just been candlelight in the church it was candlelight all the way through and then i don't even know when they did this but they pulled all you know they pulled all the purple veils off of everything and then they blast all the lights on and like it will i don't know how many bells they were ringing it was just like and for the gloria and so it's just like the you know you've been in there for like two or three hours and then it's like blazing lights and like the whole room is just filled with smoke because of all the incense and the candles and yeah it was um i wouldn't say that i was in a position to like appreciate it on like an intellectual level but like it was something like you felt like you could walk through a doorway you know yeah that's right because in the easter vigil all of the lessons come before you actually start mass in the uh in the extraordinary form yeah yeah integrated into the mass like they are in the ordinary form so now i'm starting to put it put it all together yeah you've got the four big you've got four big prophecies which when you think about i've been really mulling on what those are and the first one is is um the creation account and it uh i don't know did i just lose you guys i think i just lost i'm here i'm here oh great okay my screen just froze up any rate the fact that like you start christ resurrection with the as far as i know the only time in the year when we read the creation of the world is it father either of you might know this is it saint nephron the syrian that says um that when christ is dying now we last now but i think he's actually going for saint maximus the confessor um when christ is dying he's making the world right something like that i like j.s. bach the baroque lutheran composer who would be his catholic equivalent like who would the catholic send in the baroque era if there was a match for best composer you're revealing a little bit of my um ignorance here you're revealing a little bit of my um ignorance here would it be heiden i think he was like austrian wasn't he now looks like we're gonna have to uh we're gonna have to look this up um um yeah i think i think this might be your oh he's what is he 1732 to 1809 so i think he would be after bach yeah okay um do we got to go a little bit earlier so so i don't know i think when we go earlier than heiden you end up just getting um i mean i think uh motzart was uh was catholic too but i guess the guy i would send in and this might not uh match up the eras properly but that would be palestrina um palestrina was kind of the kind of the guy as far as i'm concerned um but yeah yeah i mean look everybody can and should love bach so um i don't know if we've got anybody from his era um that would uh that would match him um so there isn't another as big as bach uh palestrina is great charlie thank you thank you i think you're looking for maximus the confessor ted when he was creating the world while he was hanging on the cross boy okay well now think about this ted think about this uh did you have dinner tonight all right yeah what was your dinner it was a roast chicken it was delicious that chicken had to be sacrificed in order to feed you and your family right yeah yeah there's literally literally nothing exists without some kind of sacrifice yeah yeah yeah no i'll buy it i mean no i'll buy it i mean he's the lambs laying before the foundations of the world didn't yeah they would even mix people used to mix sacrificial animal blood into the mortar of buildings like when you're laying the foundation wow so that's one aspect of that that statement right there yeah yeah a mass a mass is actually kind of like a standard a standard uh composition that would people would do um so uh so you can even get like a mass by lennard bernstein and i don't know if anybody's ever actually used it in a liturgy but it's like it's a standard set of texts that you would set the music up and um and ligity ligity right this ultra crazy ultra weird 20th century composer his curie a la son was uh the music on the moon from 2001 a space odyssey which if you remember that it sounded like a like a roaring beehive like yeah that is a yeah vivaldi all the i'm i'm not the right person to ask about classical music uh so but yes vivaldi was a priest um never knew that yeah well i hope he was a good priest too you never know what would you hope every priest is a good priest father yeah yeah yeah i just know lots of priests oh my goodness tapes and sizes oh my goodness that is fascinating that i i tried to make it through 2001 space odyssey and actually i think the young people would call it rage quitting a rage quit in that one scene where he's like floating across the length of this the the ship and then like a wide angle and there's just the sound of like hissing gas and him breathing and i think i got 90 seconds into that scene he hadn't made it halfway and i'm just like i'm done i loved the book and i'm like i can't i cannot i can't do this anymore yeah someone was a bird yeah birds birds masses are beautiful they're not the kind of thing yeah i i really love them especially his mass for four voices and for five voices are just uh they're exquisite and they feel i'm talking about this with my sister they feel so english like when i listen to him like this is english catholicism in my head is like william bird it just i don't know how simultaneously it feels so deeply roman catholic and so english at the same time because england was a model catholic country it straight up was it was the thinking best you had a monastery every three miles and that was your social security you'd always have a bed and and food right and like you know were the monks all great no but they still did enough of their jobs to be worthwhile to society and henry the eighth is evil so i read i i wish i could this sounds like something that tom hollenwald talked about but it wasn't him but i read something recently that there's like the towns in england that had cistercian monasteries you know which again were all gone with um by the 1500s um they're they're like noticeably higher on all these like things like say economic growth over time levels of education all this stuff and like as opposed to the neighboring english towns that did not have cistercian monasteries and they're able to pick up these signals in terms of like basically municipal well-being 500 years later due to the presence of cistercians in the area which i found to be really interesting you've got you've got an extremely organized and motivated workforce right there you know you just got all these monks and you've got one abbot directing them if the abbot has any common sense he will delegate appropriate amounts of authority to keep things uh running properly and it's like what are you gonna do well you're gonna chant and you're gonna work sometime for recreation because you're not expected to be a robot right but uh you know are you gonna be playing cards are you gonna be dancing are you gonna be drinking during when you're gonna be drinking but they're not gonna they're not gonna be making themselves silly uh yeah yeah no i mean those the the people who this study that they published that was one of their one of their main thoughts was like basically legacy legacy cultural changes from the way that the monks lived caring no from to secular life around them and then that going on down through all that time GDP is not the same as well-being i'll say that yeah that's out of my wheelhouse i don't know anything about uh oh and here comes charlie with the uh with the kate zian economics here wars are excellent for economies just spend money it's great oh man father have you ever uh come across again dr john kudabeck any chance john kudabeck kudabeck he's on virginia i have not i've met him several times he can come and talk like small catholic conferences things like that but i ran into him actually years before he became catholic and he had a problem this is related to economics this one reason i'm having a hard time here and yeah hold on a second is that is that better that's a lot better great i don't know where the sound is coming from i think anyway um now i look like a hacker charlie i'm in um he talks about he talks about economics is fundamentally originally being about the management of the home right eco meaning the house and whatever how do you parse that other thing out into numbers basically but originally it meant the management of the household and um you know he's kind of like a classical philosopher in the sense of like being very precise and telling me to pay attention to words that you didn't get to before and thinking hard about them just very like that kind of thing and you know what was that six years ago that i've been talking about that is just really fascinating when you see that shift in the way that we use the word economics to talk about the economy of the country versus economics of a household which you know you're saying gdp isn't same as well-being and that way of thinking about economics is etymologically properly relating to a home actually is much better getting those two together and saying you know what kind of prosperity do we want what kind of wealth do we want not can we get them with the numbers quicker yeah i mean better to have uh happy children at a small house than miserable children in a massive house right you would think that everyone would say right but but but yes all those mcmansions empty mcmansions yeah so uh another thing about a home economy is that you can't just run up debt endlessly i mean there's like actually other people will help you know help you not do that by not lending you money anymore you mean there becomes a correspondence between spending and value generation yeah yeah that's that's probably the healthy one then uh all of your business in the home uh has taken place on a human scale so you're not uh you know it's like i remember listening to history channel documentaries you know about 19th century labor conditions right you've got you know this this uh matchstick factory that wanted to save money on on make production of matchsticks so instead of using red phosphorus which was slightly more expensive but a 100 times safer they used white phosphorus and then they you know they would also have the doors locked so that people couldn't uh bunch out of work early and it was primarily employing women and inevitably when they switched to the white phosphorus they had a horrible fire in the in the factory and the doors were locked so nobody could get out so everybody died now it's nice that that doesn't happen in the united states of america but we've basically just shipped all of that garbage overseas yeah that one's that one's tough it i mean i think about whole kings north talked about this a lot in terms of living with giant giant form-wise system and you know the rapaciousness of all of it so how are we going to do this are we going to have some like equally complex technological society that's also like eco-friendly and humane or something or should we regulate our appetites and try to live on the smaller scale as possible oh definitely the first option definitely the first option there's no way in heck you can get anybody to regulate their appetites not ever not never yeah exactly i mean like oh no no wonder no wonder we're in the kind of mess that we're in like it's just it's just wild i mean what is this um the common order about changing 56 windows in the house that one person lives yeah that which i've been recently done some like earthwork around houses like this where it's the same thing it's like a couple of the decrepit dog and they're like putting in a giant pool house next to their 4500 square foot house and you're like but i'm sure they're all energy efficient windows right not against energy efficient windows neither am i but i'm like my friend calls this because it's the wrong goose like you're following the wrong goose right now oh my yeah it's like uh you know in terms of this again the funny thing is like you know you see all these metrics of efficiency and you're like how efficient is it for one person to drive a tesla it's like a lot more efficient than one person driving an suv but in terms of passenger mot gas mile passenger miles per gallon take that and compare it to a family of 12 in a 15 passenger van and they'll blow every other form of transportation out of the water oh boy yeah but the insurance companies don't like those 15 passenger vans we can't we can't use them on church trips anymore the uh the insurance companies and the lawyers oh gosh they actually run the diocese it's super depressing but the insurance companies and the lawyers they so it's like oh no 12 we can't do a 12 seater van or a 15 seater van on a church trip so we've got to like get this rickety old bus that we're taking and it's like oh my gosh like just slow down on the curves for pete's sake people don't flip the van oh my goodness father i when i was in college yeah yeah that's that's what's the other term what's the term for that in um local local maximums that's that you're that's a local maximum right there you're like we're getting this one efficiency and it's like but on the 15 passenger fans i had a i had an internship in college with an inner city ministry of the northeast where like my third day on the job we're gonna teach you how to drive a 15 passenger van around jersey city get ready and then it was like because next week you're driving 12 five years old it's amazing what you can do oh my goodness and even though he's late to the party he's still the life of it how you doing andrew k oh yeah hello hello i like that intro oh goodness did you have a good visa in albies today uh a a what now uh so in the old mass today was called either low sunday sunday or visa in albies um well i think i had a regular mass today not not one of those so i guess you had a missa de albies well i was wearing my off-white life of christ chasable or me said albies yeah yeah so it was it was off-white i've got a picture of it actually i'll i'll uh i'll throw it up here uh uh liturgy and finery here we go isn't that like ivory color here we go uh present i'm gonna start this from the beginning trust me this is definitely gonna have a payoff here there's one nice looking oh okay there's my life of christ chasable here so wonderful starts off with the annunciation and then we've got the birth of our lord we got the presentation the baptism in the jordan transfiguration and on the reverse side it finishes the life of christ so some nice pictures and charlie's pastor was wearing a button down in jeans the mega church wins again man if that's winning i'm happy to be a loser i wasn't wearing that today i was i wasn't wearing jeans but i wasn't wearing that so don't know where that puts me puts you right where you belong i think right so i just hopped in i heard you guys talking about buses yeah driving a bunch of five-year-olds to a swimming pool in jersey city right right and uh on a bus wait you went all the way to jersey city uh ted did some kind of an internship there years this is years ago years and years ago back when i was a young man and had the energy to hurt 25 year olds that aren't mine around so yeah yeah those it it was fascinating how adaptable i was because i think you know when i was driving around those streets you know you've got 18 inches of clearance on either side of a bunch of parked cars and you're like if i was in arkansas i would think that this is absolutely impossible because it's normal here you just do it like it's fine you'll manage most americans out in the country have no idea what size their vehicles are it's never relevant what size your vehicle is right yeah yeah and it's not until you like in a city you like start practicing a little bit you're like yeah i'm about three inches away from those cars over there and you just just do it you know usually you don't have an accident you have no idea what it's like out here in the sticks andrew k uh no yeah just squeezing your your your vehicles through tiny new england alleyways uh yeah sometimes you can take your dually tunner pickup truck and open both all the doors and then just drive down the highway like that if you want to i've seen some uh interesting trucks on the highway that have like double wheels on each side and it looks like they try to make the truck as wide as possible and i'm not sure why it's called the dually it gives you more traction yeah and all right so those andrew if you want to like me to go way more in depth than you probably want to know a lot of the bigger trailers on small trucks they're called a gooseneck and it transfers the load into the middle of the bed right over the rear axle so we've got four tires maybe this is an arkansas thing i don't know we call them fifth wheels we call them fifth wheels yeah fifth wheels are goosenecks yeah fifth wheels i've never heard it called the gooseneck before that's just an arkansas thing that i'm don't know interesting it looked like a gooseneck i feel the gooseneck thing i think yeah so anyway the the tires give you way more extra traction and and weight distribution because they'll put a ton of weight on there but three or four months ago at our parish i don't know who this was but someone was there with i kid you not an eight seater dually f-350 i was like i don't know what this is but i want it so bad did it have a full bed on it too full bed six-door full bed i was like where did this come from it came from every environmentalist's nightmare oh my gosh it wouldn't it was not fitting in the parking spot no no you get two parking spots automatically with that i want to see if that's standard uh trust me father it's not i looked through all mad expensive custom jobs okay it's a custom job okay you're looking like i mean i really wanted the dealering get this i went home i went home and looked it up online to see if we could get one there is my gosh that's amazing see my dad had a full-size chevy 3500 a 2000 chevy 3500 but i got to uh to drive to high school because he had to he had a much longer drive than i did and he didn't want to pay for all that gas there so it had the it had the crew cab and it had the full bed and i felt like i was parking an aircraft carrier that's that's so great oh my goodness a mega cab 350s man oh what a time to be alive what a time to be alive now we got a we got a question here in the chat that i've been meaning to come back to muslims forbid usury what do catholics say about usury this is actually a really interesting question i don't know the full answer to it but apparently the last papal condemnation of usury came in like 1734 and the church has been silent on the issue ever since i don't know what that means so one of these days i'm going to get to the bottom of it and figure things out but until then um yeah apparently like the first i don't know apparently franciscans were known for small business loans back in the later middle ages with reasonable interest rates and nobody condemned them for it it'd be like one or two percent interest on the small business loan and then there's like a difference between whether or not the loan is guaranteed personally or not i i've never been able to get to the bottom of it so anyway i could probably find you an interesting corner of the internet where you could uh ask some questions about it but the answer is it's complicated have you heard the distinction i was someone asked me about this and i was reading but have you heard the distinction between like loans for that will for money that will generate more money versus loans for like living expenses because that was one of the distinctions that i because those were the distinctions that i had heard was like say you're say say someone you get a loan to like make a small business per se that's not usually but if you get a loan for because like you're between jobs you need money to pay for your family's food that would be usury to charge interest on that right i remember that distinction i remember thomas aquinas saying that it's forbidden it's a sin to lend money out at usury but it's not always a sin to uh get loaned money uh with with usury so that's that's that's a distinction that i remember is in aquinas there problem is is that aquinas wasn't dealing with modern economics so i'm sure his principles would hold up i just don't know how to apply them because like all of this finance stuff like like what's a credit default swap and how do you get the money out of people for that question i don't know i don't know why why are stocks so expensive are they actually worth that amount of money i just try not to worry about it make sure that i don't spend more money than i have that's how i handle my economics so yeah yeah as usa does have an astronomical debt to the money lenders and yeah i think it's a protestant country though the protestant christianity i don't think has ever wondered about i don't think it's ever wondered about usury maybe it has maybe there's maybe there's you know i bet you the radical reformation is all against usury i bet you the meninites and the hudarites and the anabaptists and the amish they probably don't do any any usury so they probably got to figure it out that's i'm literally guessing though i have no idea so don't uh yeah don't you signing off ted i'm gonna sign off it was a pleasure it's always always a pleasure that uh andrew k you've got to go back and watch the beginning of this video when he starts talking about go dot go it's amazing oh god is that why laura says that yeah it's amazing that that whole bit there was like we should we should have read that already that's what we should have read again with fresh eyes with ted oh my goodness you'll have a great night enjoy the rest of your easter tide and look forward to pentacost looking forward to pentacost that's right what is the impetus behind michael angelo painting god the father pentacost looking forward to pentacost that's right what is the impetus behind michael angelo painting god the father he had forgotten the tradition and was arrogant and he painted god the father i don't know it was the renaissance people were going nuts all over the place uh all sorts of stuff oh man it's just uh don't paint god the father and uh andrew k when you're uh when you're designing your churches no no images of god the father if you need to you can have a hand coming down from heaven we can deal with that okay got it you got that got it good i can redo the sistine chapel if you'd like literally literally if if you did redid the sistine chapel but instead of the father it was christ i'd be pretty amenable to it you know all right like we don't have to do that big a fix you know all righty unusery john calvin says it's not an outright bad but don't you dare take advantage of the poor that sounds nice joe blames particularity but isn't the incarnation of the ultimate expression of particularity well if you look at like some of this ian mcgillchrist stuff is that they'll point at the late middle ages and the renaissance as a point where you know you've got the the left brain the left brain is all into particulars left brain creates a virtual space where you can break things into pieces and play with them also handles processing grammar the right brain is the the continuous processing actually connects to the world and and should be the one piloting the ship so mcgillchrist in his book says that the later middle ages and the renaissance was one of those points where the influence of the left brain started overtaking the rightful balance and and making making itself kind of known there so i think that's the sort of particularity that peugeot is is talking about there because he he has if you if you've listened to his conversation with ian mcgillchrist peugeot basically says i agree with 98 percent of everything that you've said about this over separating so there's a way of doing particularity where you're separating something from its appropriate context right that's what the right brain is able to manage to do is it's actually able to contextualize things place them where they belong the left brain doesn't have that capability it's not that speciality so i think it's that sort of particularity that that peugeot was pointing at that takes things out of their context but if you've got like a link of of where he trashes michael angelo which is a hearty pastime that i will encourage for anyone i'd be interested to see the way he explains that so that's my take but yeah the incarnation is the ultimate expression of particularity but it's it's it's one of those things where things are really held in tension there because you know it's like the whole of the human race everybody everywhere is able to locate themselves in christ not in spite of his particularity but because of his particularity right because it had to it had to happen in history otherwise we wouldn't believe it and so the particularity is is like a it's like a funnel through which we get to the universality of the entire body of christ across the world i hope that made sense to somebody besides me i don't know andrew what do you think that sounds fairly pejorative okay other about you other azure i think jacob would disagree with you but you know what can you do i jacob disagrees with me all the time so he still lets me use his stream yard yep enlightenment's overrated yeah but still good i wouldn't go back so you know it's more like we've got to integrate the enlightenment and sometimes the enlightenment doesn't want to be integrated but i happen to be a fan of living in a world where we can do surgery with anesthesia so i don't want to go back to did they not have anesthesia because it was the enlightenment or no no no no the scientific revolution helped us discover anesthesia i see okay i thought you were saying you don't want to go back to renaissance because they didn't have anesthesia no no no no wow yeah yeah glad we got that cleared up yeah the enlightenment doesn't happen without the incarnation yeah i mean i don't know god's providence orders all things we should we should just be at peace and let history happen and try to align ourselves with christ properly my all my children would be dead if we went back i'm not saying go back not saying go back i don't know how to resolve these issues right because we just seem to be addicted to technological solutions to spiritual problems but i don't think the answer is go back to a time before technology this is another point that peugeot's made that i really appreciate is that so andrew either of you in the biblical story who founds the first city uh cain pain is the founder of the first city so what do you think the bible's attitudes towards cities are at that point evil they're not good they're right that's like cain cain was the first one right and you see you know if you haven't seen peugeot's video on the book of enoch like go ahead and turn this off and go watch that because because that's some top quality stuff right there this this technology and this amplification of our power uh does not tend to do us any good but in the final chapters of the bible we see the holy city jerusalem come down out of heaven and so this whole thing with the technology of the city gets redeemed in the end uh it gets redeemed by jesus so basically if you're just showing up and trying to do what you think the lord is calling you to that's enough the list of problems people interpret as spiritual is getting dangerously short yeah yep yep yep and it looks like a golden borg cube get that right phlebas in the book of revelation it's a golden borg cube that comes out of heaven you guys you kids don't even know what a borg cube is do you know that's one of those cubes from star trek isn't it and they eat people's brains and shoot lasers and stuff you get integrated into the uh into the borg oh yeah that's right yeah i was a huge next-gen fan as a kid so this this is a borg cube they were giant they'd like like the enterprise would be like the size of my cursor in comparison to it and the borg would come and they'd have these crazy shields and they wouldn't and you wouldn't be able to until they figured out a clever way to uh to do their yeah resistance is futile resistance is futile but belvis and sally joe are on the uh same thing people add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own yeah that's fake unity right there right that is um that's sci-fi enemy and probably the most potential i don't know if the star trek writers ever actually fully brought out everything they could have done with the point oh these are my people here you will be they're just quoting star trek right back at me wow so yeah um the new jerusalem is not going to be a borg cube it's going to be uh it's going to be beautiful oh that satisfies all my fears of heaven and really afraid it was going to be a huge borg borg cube yeah here we go there it is that's what it's going to look like uh oh okay um i think that's a muslim image right there all right now i'm just curious check that out what a time to be alive look at what photoshop is produced we have architects in heavy do a bit of designing it looks like oz the borg cube is beautiful okay charlie you you just keep it oh sally joe don't tell me what to do i will not be tolerant not unless i have to oh sure about the borg cube thing yeah yeah no i've uh i've really touched a nerve with uh what's with the uh chat here in this this borg distinct uh discussion so yeah it better make sure that gets uh put into the updated title as the next star trek no no no i uh i update the titles of these live streams so it's not just uh open mic over and over again so now it's going to be a go borg cube go it might be that'd be a great name yeah the woke borg right so like the borg are like the perfect symbol of a mindless ideology uh so you just you know your uh they've got it your biological and technological distinctiveness is added to their own but your entire individuality and personality is then there oh yeah the work that's so sorg will add you to our own now i sure hope not i've never watched deep space nine uh they made the pope and evil woman oh that's too bad they made the pope they made the pope and evil woman oh the deep space i thought you said and evil well he did type that but that was just a typo oh okay i'm not going to become tolerant you can't make me yes all right i'll be intolerant then you just you just go ahead nope oh we lost andrew we lost andrew it's okay we've got to spare andrew ready to go yeah that's right we always got an andrew uh waiting on deck just in case let me keep the supply keep the supply of andrew i mean what um it means manly right we need more of that so manly yeah deep space nine is not pope glad to hear it because as much as 90 sci-fi is good it's not all good oh snap this is a rare treat ladies and gentlemen we got mark f i was tempted by uh the deep space nine chat um well you're gonna have to fill the space because i know very little about it i think oh no i haven't seen that one i've seen voyager that's it no no no no no i come back come back he's offended i think i wanted him to talk i was i bet you it's his wife haven't even seen deep space nine smh father i'm out of here i i forgot to turn off the stream and i turned off the wrong thing okay um so the funny part is i've been trying to write an article on how to do like a properly spiritual character and they're talking about um do you remember roe larren from uh the next generation father roe larren ensign roe yeah i don't remember anything about her but i remember the name okay so she's a bajoran and that's the big thing about deep space nine is part of the conflict resolves around the occupation of beijor by the kardassians who basically like you know they they came in they raped the planet and then left um and who she's talking about is the kai who is the spiritual leader of beijor but she's more like the dalai lama than the pope yes and not space pope exactly the big thing for me is that the bajorans are like the secular person's idea of what a religious person does where it's like let me pray about this it's like oh christ like it's not good it's not good the wormhole aliens that tell you stuff in the future because they're out of time my my contention is that the klingons are actually what a spiritual people look like where i think so they don't have any distinction that this is not true they act 100 like this is what you do this is the way the universe works and i will not be argued about with this this is just apparent right well the religious because the borg are seeking perfection and they're after the absolute perfection thing and that is like the people people pooh pooh uh voyager which i mean sure fine yes everything that would be wrong if a female was captain because that is actually how it would be but don't pay attention to that story and pay attention to the seven of nine story that's in that story because that is a freaking great story okay yeah she she is like perfection and it's kind of like the ultimate secular yeah transhumanist horror is what the borg are well and that's that's her last um that's seven of nine's last hook back into the borg she knows she doesn't want to be borg she knows she wants to be an individual but she can't help it she still is enamored with their pursuit of perfection and that is like totally the way atheism is like it's such a freaking interesting thing it's like yeah it's kind of like data's brother um who i should remember his name lor yeah thinking he was better than people like it just ah so good yeah i don't think i've watched star trek in like maybe three whole years wow watch it almost wow watch it almost every night no like i had like you gotta quit that at some point i did watch andromeda recently um but i was actually oh so cringy oh but i was actually because now i understand the the philosophy references and i didn't understand the philosophy references when i had watched it before and the fascinating thing about freaking andromeda now to me is why are the nichiens the only people in the entire series that are pro family because they're genetic racists so they're like they're gonna survive because they're the only ones having kids like they're the only ones there's like i gotta make it to my my son's 10th birthday you know he's my 14th like yeah adorable like they're what the heck what's going on i don't even know i think that's exactly what's going on like who's having kids these days religious people it's going to be a self-resolving problem if no one else does well you know why do you bring that up uh sorry father go ahead the only the only way that uh that they the evil ones could really have kids is you know by luring them out to a ginger bread house in the middle of the woods and stuffing them in an oven that's no that's a that's an image of uh that's an image the thing is lots of things are becoming brightly colored and it is not unrelated but listen houses aren't made out of gingerbread just remember that remember that houses are not made out of gingerbread i'll tell my son that he won't believe things that are candy-coated are just really like anything that's candy colored is starting to scream i'm poisonous horrid red things all right but father you make an interesting uh thing that because it kind of coincides with this uh book i've been reading um and this whole thing that's gone on in israel with the judicial reforms and that it's almost where you're looking at that demographic wave in israel is kind of proceeding what's happening here where all the people who had kids now they have voting power and they're trying to take over against the old guard who don't have any kids or don't have as many kids and they're in the you know i don't want to say secular parts but they're in the non-democratic parts of the country and trying to hold out against an oncoming wave yeah yeah and so i you know it's like yeah oh andrew needs a stream yard like here we go yeah yeah uh it's just not fun to be in that inflection point or to be before that inflection point yeah you feel like you're the underdog you're getting pounded on yeah having your church shed on fire we still haven't fixed that yeah i'm sure money's tight uh we did get cameras installed though yeah oh man yeah there was a uh a statue vandalization i think uh about three or four years ago uh a pretty bad one um outdoor statue and they've actually restored and uh repaired the statue instead of just getting a new one which i'm happy about we're gonna mute you if you're gonna be like that entity on the build site yeah on the build site oh man i will tell you what's really weird though uh this is the second time um our father has uh mentioned me and my son in a sermon uh i'm like oh you in particular yeah me in particular like pointing to me and pointing to my son like oh is it is it like look at our families or yeah no like specifically like you know he came into the church he didn't know anything he read his way here he knows more than you oh okay perhaps you should learn more it's like oh oh okay oh dear i i don't think i would do that or like i think part of it was he i mean i'm paraphrasing badly for comedic effect but it was more like you don't know the thing you grew up with and he knows it because he didn't grow up with it so you should dig deep into that grace that you were given and appreciate it more i hate that from the top it makes me so salty because if it's not like it was your plan to grow up in the church and not have a blessed conversion story i didn't have a blessed conversion well but i mean but i mean like what are you supposed to do like yes i was born here and i stayed and i didn't leave oh no like this is just like a weird thing like yeah you could learn more like i'm sure like it's like yeah but that's just i don't see how that helps like the fish that doesn't know the water yeah i mean like i can i can feel feel my brother up there in canada you know that like you're not just a cat here is nigerian accent too yeah yeah uh he's nigerian okay that's he's nigerian okay that puts a lot into context but it's um it's like yeah you know this isn't just something that you you don't you don't get the inheritance just by being here you've got to unlock it now that's not the right way to phrase it i'll come up with a better way to phrase it uh so uh campus group that does believer baptism and a lot of the guys are new in my defense sally i was 14 and kai win sure looked like the pope but that's what they based i think they tried to make her like the pope right and like the dalai lama i don't think has the same sort of teaching authority that the successor of saint peter does if you if you pay attention to it so much more like not just buddhism but specifically california hipster buddhism definitely 100 that's basically what the bajorans are yeah yeah i mean that's probably the religion that the writers of star trek have access to yeah they're better because they're the underdogs right that was the freaking like that was there's a lot of annoying under things with like it's really interesting that starfleet could exist at all and not be the bad guy that's what that's what dspace night is is towards the end right this was a special time like when there actually could be a starfleet and they could be the biggest thing out there and they could be the good guy like yeah like that was america in the early 90s you know yeah hw bush could have said mission accomplished we don't need all this military spending anymore we beat the commies we should have just went straight to space then that's the problem go to space then right it went to space and we just had to go be the world police we got distracted and the vulcans didn't show up that's true that's true we didn't have uh zephyrum cochran dancing drunk yeah now here's the question do you like first contact zephyr cochran or original series zephyr cochran better oh first contact yeah i don't know i i kind of like some of that 60s idealism you know that this was this man was just a real vision but it's like that's like that's like the difference between the 60s and the 90s is you could just have unironic visionaries in the 60s you know and like by the 90s it's like oh we got to take these guys down a notch huh i definitely liked uh the next generation like the best like absolutely the best i like the klingons from them i like the romulans from them like absolutely the best and there's cool like i like all of the stuff with phurangies in deep space nine i love all of that i like uh the romulans in beijor but it's like starfleet in deep space nine who cares like well that's the point right is the whole show is a is a not a not dark criticism but it's um it's trying to put things in a more what they consider realistic critical eye yeah well and it's it's funny though because what made starfleet so good was it not being there yes exactly you can only do it once though and that's the problem you can only do one show like that you can't have all the shows be deep space nine right it's only good done once kind of like the the peugeot keep the fringe at the fringe in the center at the center right right oh that's interesting way to think about it and that actually was where it was because the delta quadrant was at the fringe yeah oh that's fascinating yeah just like because there's that quote from the second uh episode of the second episode of the second season where he's like you know the reason that they're saints is because they're an eden out here on the frontier there are no saints and see and that's maybe why firefly could only be one season because they were the fringe people was the focus of the show i mean besides the horrendous treatment they received at fox i i think they probably could have gotten a few i mean i don't know if they would have kept the pace up but they probably could have gotten five seasons i think i mean i i loved the whole space cowboy thing and i i loved the whole like um the way the empire was trying to assert authority on the farthest reaches of the universe thing um and that is just totally my own personal biases because like yeah from west river south dakota thinking that centralized authorities are bad well i definitely think they would kill you if they were far enough away from home oh goodness oh yeah no i love the firefly i wish it could have been a bunch of seasons but maybe it just couldn't be like you like the movie oh yeah i like serenity i like i liked all of it like but but the thing is the thing about those really really wild restaurant stories is they were really short like you only get to rob the feds and run to a different state for like a short amount of time like you either settle down and change everything or you're done in like not too long like that's that's the thing about like the hero bank robber or robin hood or anything like that you're gonna die quick it's a short day king david had to become king yeah it has to change or burn away like you know not childish things yeah like the people with really long narratives are quite dull it's like and he he raised wheat for 75 years now his son argus also raises the same field one year they had a bright infestation but they burnt it like that's the really boring like the really long stories are boring like that like but that's a lot sounds so bad but well the thing is like how many sweet summers do they have like you know if you just raise wheat and you get to watch it how many how much sunrise and sunset do you get that's you know yeah yeah right if you i guess well that's the thing right uh i think it was charl cw charl cw cook from nr had put this out the goal of a good polity is to make life boring they're doing pretty good right like that that's generally the goal but we aren't piano keys so we start trying to break things well um so in uh tolkien in the simirilian um he they talk about malcor um who started affecting the creation of the world and some of malcor's creations were good like fire and ice and um i think about that because when you're thinking about um is exist is all the pain suffering and horror exist in in existence worth it for existence to exist and when you get to struggling with why because you will at some point if you're paying attention trouble with why um i think one of the reasons could be the the contrast that it allows you to comprehend because i don't know that you actually could comprehend the contrast um without it and it's pretty it's pretty bitter medicine but it might be effective well i think you reasoned your way to the same thing that c.s lewis did that one of his ideas is that it allows courage to exist where if there wasn't evil there'd be no courage um maybe i don't know i struggle with c.s lewis he's very much like a dry saltine cracker and i want really create his nutritional value but i really have a hard time with it he's so readable though i'm surprised the i'll tell you what i did like of his i liked whispers from a silent planet and the the space trilogy i liked that very very much but as far as his non-fiction stuff um it's it's it's like a dry saltine cracker i have tried i have tried i don't know how many times i have tried i have tried both in the paperback book and audiobook to listen to mere christianity and my brain just goes and i i just i want to though because paul if only to talk to paul about it probably andrew clay um because he just is convinced it's the best thing ever and my brain is and that just could be a quirk in me yeah it might be the case that paul needs miracles by c.s lewis in a way that you don't um well maybe i do and my inability to get through it um is a personal problem but well that would be that would be really horrible is that if you needed something and god hadn't equipped you in order to receive it that would be awful i am sure it wouldn't just be like a plan i could probably be doing something dumb but i just haven't figured out what it is yet in order to stop i'm not gonna lay that i got i'm sure i can mess it up not every book's for everybody you know i uh well like here's here's here's the thing i don't think everybody needs to read aquinas i don't do i love aquinas i don't think everybody needs to read old statement no i have actually found some of my best um hope fodder would have was from like uh dan carlson's whole hardcore history and like jockel willick and like sometimes when you already get to a dark place the acknowledgement of the darkness is a deep and sweet relief because when you're with a bunch of people they're like oh no it's fine so things just happen it'll be okay and they're not acknowledging horror um it makes you feel crazy inside and um like when uh when we when we pulled out of a canistán and i was pretty mentally aware of how many people were going to be butchered because of it and i was not coping with it very well i ended up watching don the pleb who is a yeah i know him on on dysregulated marine that was what i was trying to see but sometimes when i'm having dysregulated military problems the only thing that can calm a another vet down is listening to another dysregulated military person and he when he when that went down he did like i don't know how many hour live stream just to basically talk people down and be like yeah it sucks it's real it's happening we know yes and it was good because that's what i need i needed somebody to just be like yep it sucks for this and this and this and this reason and then yeah by the administration shills talking about how this is all actually wonderful yeah yeah like oh i mean the fact nope nope not gonna say things like that on stream i am going back in my box box box box have fun in your box sally i need my box sometimes sometimes you gotta have a box it's good to have a box and you can put all the things that youtube is it ready for in there very upsetting and you should take great comfort in the restraint of capable people and know it is deeply unlikely that civil anarchy is on its way because if the people that could have dealt with that chose not to deal with that for the stability of the country they're probably not going to take that option anytime soon because that was kind of peak reasons for a minute there yes that's a moderated way to say it i'm happy with that all righty very good i'm glad you did not um become dysregulated yes i'm working on regulation i have for some time yeah okay oh my you have to admit your humanity that it has the capability of that in order to uh do that yes so very good it sneaks up it's bad there's some bad stuff out there i mean it's one of the reasons i don't i don't want anything to do with true crime i don't have any don't watch any serial killer stuff no murder stuff no crime stuff except for cops because i can laugh at people um i i had one point um i think it um i i had one point um i think it was like in 2011 i realized for entertainment i was watching uh uh house the doctor and then um special victims unit and death and something kind of serial killer and i was like oh i must quit this and started watching scrubs again which now i'm just like why was i watching tv i could have just not been watching tv but it was actually really critical that i at least stop watching multiple dark things every day yeah when house is the least dark that's uh so i'm glad you i'm glad you came to that realization oh my you just watch stop watching a tv entirely though well i've seen i've seen the building where they had the doctor house building is that in your neck of the woods yeah well at princeton a popular drug that nobody mentions is fiction because because i don't drink and i don't smoke and i don't do a variety of other drugs that i kind of imagine would be fun um but i did watch gratuitous amounts of television just gratuitous amounts for way too long and it was a huge waste of like my teenage into almost 30s you don't want to know my slash played on wow you don't want to know no no like yeah video games could have been like that too um but no i i always just would check out into them and like i would i would use sitcoms and tv shows like the way people use books absolutely absolutely i suffer no delusions it were fiction books or whatever and some of them were good like i think i think like uh like some of them were good but the way i was using was bad it's like you can drink whiskey or you can like drink whiskey and like i was not using them in like a good way and like now i almost don't read fiction um i actually just got a bunch of fiction books that i inherited and i was like i should really like we had a cold winter which is like when it's completely justifiable and i could not enjoy them just because of how much time i knew i had wasted um yeah you're doing that i feel you i mean i used to read a lot of fantasy uh i've had to dip into stuff like that recently because i can't seem to power through any more hard books uh grad school kind of killed me on that like you know a thousand pages every week for two years and then after that you don't want to read things that take mental energy yeah and then after that i was like you know going through this whole conversion thing where i pounded through city of god i i pounded through just everything i could find and i'm like okay uh i'm just gonna read things that take no effort for a while and i almost just try to read because when it gets to be versus toddler um just reading gets difficult uh but listening to audiobooks is pretty doable so i've listened to quite a few audiobooks that's that's my main thing for a book that's not a classic is if i don't know if i'm ever going to read it again i audiobook it if i think i'm going to read it again i might get the physical copy like i need to get the physical copy of tom holland's book uh just as a way to reference it but basically if i almost never reread a book unless it's super important yeah i wonder because like i have some interest in philosophy and stuff and i wonder sometimes how much of uh education material is also just completely useless sitcom information because what's the sitcom information give me an example okay so like um if you're watching a show with other people that have watched a show then you have the experiences of that show in common and then if something happens you can say it's like this like if you've watched grubs there's a stupid little saltine game that like the two main characters that are besties like play against each other and it's like like the saltine game and like you can have actually it was really fun when i was in korea um to have watched house um because i would find myself talking to koreans who functionally knew english but didn't uh colloquially know english and so i'd be trying to explain things but then we both watched house and they'd watched it with subtitles and so one time um i explained sarcasm using house i'm like because they were like what's sarcasm and i'm like i knew they watched house i'm like it's like when it's funny but it's not like the way it's funny in house and they're like oh like they immediately got it and so you have that and that's that's actually a huge cultural bridge across huge amounts of society right now is like the media that you're engaged in but also we use like thomas aquinas and ds louis and we use all this stuff like if you only had your relationships within your family and you only had the experiences of the relationships within your family and within your town could you talk to other people in the same at the same breadth but no the bandwidth would the bandwidth would be reduced a lot so we share these these in between us things and it has to be good at some level but then i i kind of wonder where it gets self-indulgent oh academia that's what yeah jargon is right is jargon is technical shorthand where sometimes it's useful right like if you're flying a plane v2 is an important number but if i say v2 to someone who doesn't know what that means it doesn't mean anything it's just right right well it's a russian rocket platform wasn't it german so i like to imagine that my um indulgences into philosophy and learning these philosophical concepts and like all this kind of stuff i like to imagine that they're building me up as a person i like to imagine that they're inspiring me on my art and stuff but then sometimes i do get suspicious that at some levels it's just like this fantasy of self-indulgence like if it really ever really means something or if i would be better served by like planting petunias i'm not sure no i feel you i feel you because you sometimes i wonder what what am i doing reading this like yeah is this helping maybe if you just go pray another five decades of the rosary maybe that would be better uh personally we can who am i going to talk to i don't talk to anybody about this my wife her eyes just go back into her head every sunday at 7 30 yeah that's basically that's what this is for i mean did you i i know you guys probably didn't see the beginning of the the stream but did you see how excited ted got when he could talk about go dog go with a bunch of other people who had listened to pageau and i was super excited to just listen to that you guys got to catch the beginning of that what the dr zeus book it's not dr seuss but it's written in the same style and he did a pageau analysis of it and at one point he was practically crying because of how beautiful is and he was 100 percent stinking correct about it like my hat yeah right and it's like oh man you don't get that resolution of the world where everybody's on top of the tree having a glorious party until the masculine and the feminine have been reconciled oh my gosh i read the green eggs and ham um with my son and he likes to read angry guy but all he pretty much gets with is no i do not like them no and it's it's so great my son is just starting to let me read him books uh his main interest so far has been to turn the pages because he just wants to do that over and over again so he's now finally sitting down so we're trying or i'm trying to read him these nice wholesome books and like the big what is it the big catholic story bible or something with all the things in it and now maybe he'll listen as opposed to just desperately try to get the pages and cry when daddy won't let him be be careful one time when i was in the bathroom wallace got the entire book of genesis what do you mean he got it like he threw it out like like he was just barely crawling and he pulled it down from the table while i was in the bathroom and peeled it out of the book yep that's that's 100 percent what isaiah would do 100 percent they're so hungry for the truth oh my god i found your words i ate them how good your law is oh lord it's delicious like honey in the mouth oh speaking of things that i would also like to go to bed because i had two masses and an hour and a half of confessions today oh that's a long one yeah it's divine mercy sunday people wanted that divine mercy they came from all around so just doing my job so good night everybody god bless you all have a good night
