Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God forever and ever. Amen. A reading from the Acts of the Apostles. The man who was crucified was a man who was crucified in Jerusalem. He was crucified in Jerusalem. He was crucified in Jerusalem. He was crucified in Jerusalem. He was crucified in Jerusalem. He was crucified in Jerusalem. He was crucified in Jerusalem. He was crucified in Jerusalem. He was crucified in Jerusalem. He was crucified in Jerusalem. He was crucified in Jerusalem.

This is the day the Lord has saved! Let us pray and sing the praises of God. Let us rejoice, heavenly man. This is the name of the Lord, and saying, Let us rejoice, heavenly man. Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good, For his mercy endures forever. The house of Israel, and saying, His mercy endures forever.

The stone which the builders rejected, Has become the cornerstone, By the Lord has this been done, It is wonderful in all rights. This is the name of the Lord, and saying, Let us rejoice, heavenly man. A reading from the letter of St. Paul to the Colossians. Brothers and sisters, if then you were raised with Christ, Seek what is above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. Think of what is above, not of what is on earth, For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ your life appears, then you too will appear with him in glory. The word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. To the Paschal victim, give thankful praise, Christ ever sinless, is she not, he sings. Death and life contented in dreadful strife, Death did not hold him, he art of his life. Alleluia, his triumph we sing, Christ is arisen, the victor, the king. There is he confessing what you have seen, Christ, whom life sent here well once he had been. And just like on forming, drowning aside, He could to come will be healed if no one died. Alleluia, his triumph we sing, Christ is arisen, the victor, the king. Christians sing his glory with every breath, Sing of his kingdom victorious or dead. Jesus grant us mercy, new life from heaven, Christ ever reigns, alleluia, amen. Alleluia, his triumph we sing, Christ is arisen, the victor, the king. Hallelujah, Situation Alleluia. Alleluia. Hallelujah, Hallelujah Christ our Paschal Lamb has been sacrificed Let us be in peace with joy in the Lord Hallelujah, Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah When Peter arrived after him, he went into the tomb and saw the burial cloths there, and the cloth that had covered his head, not with the burial cloths, but rolled up in a separate place. Then the other disciple also went in, the one who had arrived at the tomb first, and he saw and believed, for they did not yet understand the scripture that he had to rise from the dead. The Gospel of the Lord. Praise to you Lord Jesus Christ. May all the blessings and joys of Christ's resurrection be yours. May all the blessings and joys of Christ's resurrection be yours. As we celebrate another completion of the Easter Lenten season, and now celebrate, as we so well know, for 50 days the feast of Easter, the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. So in the course of the events, it is finished. The old is completed, and the new now has begun. We have been and been able to set aside the distractions of this world, and are able to journey with Christ through Calvary and his resurrection. So on this day of the resurrection, after renewing our baptismal promises, we are renewed in Christ through the life-giving waters of baptism. And last evening the waters were blessed, and truly they are signs again of our own baptism, of the Christ presence going through the waters, and dying and rising. So we have died with him, and now are risen with him to a new life. And it's a joyous time. Let us live our baptisms by loving God and our neighbor. The two great commandments, love of God and love of neighbor. And this is truly a day of rejoicing. And during the season of Lent we have gone through a succession of little deaths. We call them penances, and we know that one of the virus has caused real stress, closed church doors, and made the sacraments difficult to receive. But spiritual communion, we know so well, is so powerfully important also. Wherever Jesus is, there is his grace. And again, the beautiful sacrament, the Eucharist, is the most sublime of all sacraments. His real and substantial and full presence. So as I mentioned, we have carried our crosses, and likewise has the Church. And within the last year a number of our parishioners have surgery, and spent time in hospitals and nursing homes, and many have died. And Father has had the joy of burying so many, preparing them for entry into the glory of heaven. We hope that will happen, if not already, soon. And I had a sister who passed away a few weeks ago, and her body lies at rest, and we hope her soul is someplace else. So also we buried a number of our beloved friends and relatives, as I mentioned. And I had a friend who died just a couple of days ago. His funeral truly is being delayed as a result of this difficult time. And we pray that his body will be laid to rest soon. But his soul, we pray, is in the hands of God. So let our prayers continue for the healing and the well-being for our dearly beloved ones who have died and passed on into eternal life. So let the whole life be formed around a life of prayer. Prayer is so absolutely essential. For through prayer, conversion with God, we are drawn deeper into the mystery of God, who God is, what did He do, what does He want us to do? And of course, He sent us His Son, the Word that became flesh, and on and on. So through prayer, works and penance, faith strengthening, forget not the mass, as we so well know, the greatest of all mysteries, the Paschal mystery, we call it sacrificial and sacramental. So this Easter season, let us look to the springtime for a new beginning and celebration of Christ's resurrection by living our baptisms. And truly, that's significantly important. Avoid the occasions of sin and sin itself. So by the waters of baptism, we were washed clean and let us remain so. And yet, when we fail, we have the beautiful sacrament of reconciliation, the room of mercy, a place where happiness and grace is restored. And again, forget not next Sunday, which is Divine Mercy Sunday. Our Lord made a promise to Sister Faustina, for the devoted souls and the faithful souls, they will enter the glory of heaven immediately upon their death. And that's why the nobina is so powerfully important. And today is the third day of the nobina for devout and holy and faithful people. And we pray for them and ourselves too, for the glory that is promised. So as we look upon the light of the Easter candle, we see more than light. We see Christ, who is the true light. And we are no longer people of darkness. Therefore, let us worship God in spirit and in truth. Let us not fail to offer ourselves as a living sacrifice to God through the holy sacrifice of the Mass, whereby all are united with Christ as He offered Himself to the Father. It is the perfect sacrifice and it's the most perfect form of worship. Our Lord says, Love me. And again, your neighbor. Our first sacrament is satisfied, our first commandment is satisfied, when we celebrate this beautiful sacrament of the Mass and sacrifice. So for none of us have anything of value to offer the Father except ourselves, our lives, our joys, our sorrows, our sufferings, and life itself. So let us be reconciled with God and each other as we await the resurrection of our bodies in the glorified and risen Christ. On this Easter day of joy and peace and praise, let us continue to live our baptisms by remaining close to our Holy Mother the Church and her life-giving sacraments of life, love, and forgiveness. And most especially, let us receive with pure and undefiled bodies and souls the most sacred and sublime sacrament of the Holy Eucharist. And finally, let us not forget to thank our most holy Mother, the Blessed Virgin Mary, for her yes to the angel Gabriel that made all of this possible. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. So on this joyful and joyous Easter day, may the blessings of Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit remain with you and throughout your whole life, forever and always. And now let us prepare to make our profession of faith by renewing our baptismal promises. Dear brothers and sisters, through the Paschal Mystery and promise to serve God in the Holy Catholic Church, and we ask you, do you renounce Satan? I do. And all his works? I do. And all his empty show? I do. Do you renounce sin as to live in freedom of the children of God? I do. And do you renounce the lure of evil so that sin may have no mastery over us? I do. Do you renounce Satan, the author and prince of sin? I do. Do you believe in God the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth? I do. Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary, suffered death, and was buried, rose again from the dead, and is seated at the right hand of the Father? I do. And do you believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of body, and life everlasting? I do. And may Almighty God the Father, our Lord Jesus Christ, bless you and protect you for all life. In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Amen. For the Church, as the body of Christ on earth, may she faithfully and courageously proclaim the truth of his resurrection. Let us pray to the Lord. Amen. For all who were received into the Church at the Easter Vigil. May they continue to grow in holiness of life and always be open to the fullness of life offered by the risen Lord. Let us pray to the Lord. Amen. For the sick and the dying, may their belief in the resurrection give them strength and hope. And we also pray for those impacted by the coronavirus. Let us pray to the Lord. Amen. For those watching here today, may our belief in the love and forgiveness of God inspire us to seek peace and reconciliation in our families and communities. Let us pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer. For those who have died marked with the sign of faith, may they come to share in the fullness of eternal life in the risen Christ. Let us pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer. For Art and Linda Spanier and Lauren and Frances Illebron, for whom this Mass is offered, may they rest in the peace of Christ. We pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer. We ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. We have been saying, all our plans are empty. They have been saying, where is their God now? Roll away the storm. See the glory of God. Roll away the storm. Roll away the storm. See the glory of God. Roll away the storm. They have been saying, no one hears the singing. They have been saying, all our strength is gone. Roll away the storm. See the glory of God. Roll away the storm. Roll away the storm. See the glory of God. Roll away the storm. Pray, brethren, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the Almighty Father. May the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands for the praise and glory of his name, for our good and the good of all his holy Church. Exultant with Paschal Gladness, O Lord, we offer the sacrifice by which your Church is wondrously reborn and nourished through Christ our Lord. Amen. Let the Lord be with you. And with your spirit. Lift up your hearts. We lift them up to the Lord. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. It is right and just. It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, at all times to acclaim you, O Lord, for on this day, above all, to love you yet more gloriously when Christ our Passover has been sacrificed. For the true Church and for the true Lamb who has taken away the sins of the world, by dying he destroyed our death and by rising restored our life. Therefore, overcome with Paschal Joy, every land, every people exalts in your praise and even the heavenly powers which with the angelic hosts sing together the unending hymn of your glory as without end we acclaim. O Lord, we acclaim. Holy, holy, holy, the Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth, our Lord, our Lord. O, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, To you, therefore, most merciful God and Father, we make humble prayer and petition through Jesus Christ, your Son, our Lord, that you accept and bless these gifts and offerings and these unblemished sacrifices, which we offer you firstly for your holy Catholic Church. Be pleased to grant her peace to guard, unite and govern her throughout the whole world, together with your servant Francis our Pope and John our Bishop, and all those who, holding to the truth, hand on the kingdom of the Lord, and to the Catholic and apostolic faith. Remember, Lord, your servants and all gathered here, whose faith and devotion are known to you. For them, we offer you the sacrifice of praise, for them, as it is an offering for themselves and all who are dear to them, for the redemption of their souls in hope of health and well-being, and paying their homage to you, the eternal God and true. Celebrating this most holy, sacred day of the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in communion with those whose memory we venerate, especially the glorious ever-virgin Mary, Mother of God and Lord of Jesus Christ. And the blessed apostles, blessed St. Joseph, her spouse, your blessed apostles and martyrs, Peter and Paul, Andrew, James, John, Thomas, James, Philip, Bartholomew, Simon and Jude, Linus, Clement, Sixtus, Cornelius, Cyprian, Lourdes, Chrysogonus, John and Paul, Cosmos and Damien, and all the saints, we ask that their merits and prayers in all things we may be defended by your protecting help through Christ our Lord. Therefore, Lord, we pray graciously accept the oblation of our sacrifice that of your whole family, which we make to you, also for those whom you have been pleased to give the new birth of water and the Holy Spirit, granting them forgiveness of all their sins. Order our days in your peace and command that we be delivered from eternal damnation and counted among the flock that you have chosen. We pleased our God, we pray, to bless and acknowledge and approve this offering in every respect and make it spiritual and acceptable so that it may become for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. On the day before he was to suffer, he took bread in his venerable and holy hands and with eyes raised to heaven, to you, O God, Almighty Father. He said the blessing, broke the bread and gave it to his disciples saying, take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is my body, which will be given up for you. In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, again giving you thanks. He said the blessing and gave the chalice to his disciples saying, take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me. The mystery of faith. Savior of the world. Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial of the blessed passion, the resurrection from the dead and the glorious ascension into heaven of Christ, your son, our Lord, we, your servants and your holy people offer to your glorious majesty from the gifts you have given us. This pure victim, this holy victim, this spotless victim, the holy bread of eternal life and the chalice of everlasting salvation. Be pleased to look upon these offerings with a serene and kindly countenance and accept them as once you accepted the gifts of your servant Abel the Just, the sacrifice of your high priest Melchizedek, a holy sacrifice, a spotless victim. In humble prayer, we ask you, Almighty God, command that these gifts be born by the hands of your holy angel to your altar on high in the sight of your divine majesty so that all of us who through this participation at the altar may receive the most holy body and blood of your son and may be filled with every grace and blessing through Christ our Lord. Remember also, Lord, your servants who have gone before us with a sign of faith and rest and sleep of peace. Grant them, O Lord, we pray, to all who sleep in Christ a place of refreshment, light and peace. To us also, your servants, who those sinners hope in your abundant mercies, graciously grant some share in fellowship with your holy apostles and martyrs, with John the Baptist, Stephen, Ithias, Barnabas, Ignatius, Alexander, Marcellinus, Peter, Felicity, Perpetua, Agatha, Lucy, Agnes, Cecilia, Anastasia, and all your saints. Admit us, we beseech you, not into their company, not weighing our merits, but granting us your pardon through Christ our Lord. Through whom you continue to make all these good things, O Lord, you sanctify them, fill them with life, bless them, and bestow them upon us. Through him and with him and in him, O God, Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is yours forever and ever. Amen, Amen, Amen. At the Savior's command and informed by divine teaching, we dare to pray. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil. Graciously grant peace in our day. By the help of your mercy, we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever. Now and forever. Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles, Peace I leave you, my peace I give you, look not on our sins, but on the faith of your church. Graciously grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will, who live and reign forever and ever. Amen. The peace of the Lord be with you always. And with your spirit. Let us offer each other the sign of peace. Have mercy on us. Have mercy on us. And take away the sins of the world. Grant us peace. Behold the Lamb of God. Behold him who takes away the sins of the world. Blessed are those called to the sufferer of the Lamb. Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed. May the body of our Lord Jesus Christ bring me to our lasting life. Christ our Passover has been sacrificed. Hallelujah. Therefore let us keep the feast with the unleavened bread of purity and truth. Hallelujah. The body of our Lord Jesus Christ. Bread of angels, we receive you with the song of our life. Precious Jesus, Lamb of angels, with the song we sing. The body of our Lord Jesus Christ. Oh, what worthy we receive you, sacrament divine. Bread of angels, accept our praises, let your glory shine. Oh, what worthy we receive you, sacrament divine. Amen. Let us pray. Look upon your church, oh God, with unfailing love and favor, so that renewed by the Paschal mysteries, she may come to the glory of the resurrection through Christ our Lord. The Lord be with you. Spirit. God bless you, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Go in peace. Hallelujah. Number 575, number 575. Praise the Lamb of God, to receive honor and glory, worthy are the ones who believe, to receive the goodness of God. Worthy are you, oh Paschal Lamb, wisdom and strength, he hung down to you, you laid down your life and died upon the cross, leaving no one but you alone.
