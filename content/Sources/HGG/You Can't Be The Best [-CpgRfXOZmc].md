 It turns out that wanting to be the best is stupid. So the first thing to understand is that you can't be the best. The best is an abstraction of the mind. In nature, there's no such thing as the best. And if we really look at it, like, what does the best even mean? Does the best mean like in this group of people that you know? Does it mean in the history of humanity? Does it mean the people that you kind of see on social media? Like, how do you even measure the best? So the crazy thing about being the best is that it actually sabotages your motivation. It actually pushes you to give up because unless you hit your target, which is going to be really hard if you're starting from straight F's, you're actually shooting yourself in the foot and it's not going to work. The first thing that you've got to do is abandon being the best because being the best is actually rooted in insecurity. Your attempt to be the best is your attempt to actually fix the shame that you feel. And it turns out that if we metabolize that shame, if we kind of acknowledge that, hey, like I screwed up, let's focus on doing better. That's the right attitude to actually end up as awesome.
