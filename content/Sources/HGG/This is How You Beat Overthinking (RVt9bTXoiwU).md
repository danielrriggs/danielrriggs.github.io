 how do you want to defeat a particular boss in a video game? The solution is not endless theory crafting. And y'all may have even seen arguments with like noobs on the internet who are low MMR and will theory craft their way into arguments with people who are way better than them at the game. And the thing is that you can argue about against this noob on the internet, you can be way better than them, but no amount of intellectual masturbation is going to ever convince them. What's the only way that they're going to learn by actually doing something? So if you're crippled with overthinking, acknowledge that some kind of attempt is going to be anxiety provoking, maybe breathe into it a little bit, you know, check out some of the YouTube videos that we have on meditation, check out Dr. K's guide to anxiety and things like that, and really kind of acknowledge your fear and then try to actually learn instead of solve the problem.
