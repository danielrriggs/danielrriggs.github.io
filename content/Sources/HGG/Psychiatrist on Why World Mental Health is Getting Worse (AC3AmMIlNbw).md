 Because some of them will just I mean you guys will hopefully realize this too that you just don't have to live like this It's like You know like you can fix this like you can feel better on a day-to-day basis Like the Sun can be a little bit brighter. You can be a little bit happier. You can just enjoy things more So about One year ago we had a pretty significant suicide in the gaming community and I think we've had over the last year we've had a Lot of suicides in our community. I think some of them are not quite as advertised as others And so I thought what we would do today is try to just do like a quick Sort of like educational segment to help us understand suicide So today what I'd like to talk to you guys about is just sort of like a quick almost like lecture about you know Who commits suicide? Why people commit suicide? How like what's the process or what we what do we understand about the how of suicide and what you can do either for yourself? Or for someone else? So we're just gonna answer these four basic questions and the reason that I think that this this kind of lecture is important Is if you look at medicine It's advancing and we're winning as a profession So if you look at for example like HIV so HIV used to be a terminal illness and now people with HIV have a regular life expectancy We've all but eliminated some kinds of cancer At least in terms of people who get the appropriate treatment So for example, there are certain kinds of like B cell lymphomas if I'm remembering correctly that we now have Targeted antibodies that we have really good outcomes for we also have for example like HPV vaccines Which have done a huge job at sort of reducing or almost eliminating cervical cancer At least in countries that have access to the vaccine So we're like we're doing good like I don't know if you guys get this but like modern medicine is pretty dope Like do you guys understand that if my heart is busted? I can like literally get a heart from someone else and we can transplant into my body and then I can continue to live a relatively normal life if my kidneys are busted I can literally like Transplant someone else's kidney into my kidney I mean into my body and then like I can live off of that kidney So like medical science has advanced in an amazing rate and it is like really awesome. So we're seeing generally speaking Improved outcomes in most disciplines or just about every discipline of medicine The one place where we don't seem to be doing a good job And in fact arguably things are getting worse is in the mental health realm So we are sort of losing the war against mental illness And so if we look at suicide for example like suicides have not appreciably gone down In fact, if I remember correctly, they've sort of gone up over time it's also kind of staggering because You know if you look at statistics on suicide like 80% of suicides are men if I'm remembering correctly I think that's kind of a ballpark figure Depending on what source you kind of go to It'll you know The numbers may look a little bit different depending on whether you're looking at the world or a particular country developed countries versus developing countries have slightly different Statistics around that and and so we're losing this war and so like I don't really know that Just given the nature of the human mind. I don't know that we're gonna have like a pharmaceutical Revelation like we're not gonna have some kind of pharmaceutical discovery I mean if we do that would be great that you're gonna take a pill and it will Cure you of your suicidality like we certainly have medications that improve outcomes for people with depression who you know Maybe somewhat protective against suicidality So we'll talk a little bit about that but as we'll see today the reasons that people kill themselves may not all be solved by medication So the reason that I'd like to talk to you guys about suicide today is because I think that like the first step and in Fighting this war is actually like education, right? So like kind of like Sun Tzu says, you know You have to know your enemy in order to win And so my hope today is to educate our community and whoever is listening Whoever watches this down the road to help you understand a little bit about like, okay who kills themselves? Why do they kill themselves? How do they kill themselves? And what can we do about it and whether you were dealing with suicidal thoughts or you're not dealing with suicide or a friend is dealing with suicidal thoughts Furthermore, we're gonna tackle a couple of different myths around suicidality and some of these I think are quite dangerous So it's really more of like a public health Educational approach and I will urge you for the first but not the last time that if you were dealing with suicidal thoughts You should really go see a licensed professional and get help And we'll deal with some of the reasons why people don't and why it's a bad idea to listen to the part of your mind That says basically I haven't killed myself yet. So I can manage it which will look at some interesting data around that So the first question is who kills themselves? So what we what we can sort of discover like I sort of mentioned if you actually look at suicidal attempts What you discover is that more women arguably? attempt suicide Than men but it turns out that when we kind of when we're sort of looking at it attempts What we sort of discover is that not all suicide looking behavior is actually like intended to be suicidal So sometimes for example, like I've had patients that will take a bunch of pills and then will proceed to call me Or they will call a friend and they'll say hey, I just took a bunch of pills so it's sort of a suicide attempt but there's sort of like this kind of idea that like Sometimes it's people are looking, you know to say goodbye But sometimes they're actually like it's a little bit more provocative and it's sort of almost like a cry for help you're sort of demonstrating to people that You really need help and you're willing to go to drastic measures but at the same time you're not like you're not using your full faculty of thinking to actually commit suicide and So what we sort of discover is that when you really tunnel down into the research, there are a lot of parasuicidal behaviors So things like cutting or self-injurious behavior or like threats for suicide attempts that it seems like statistically We're not entirely sure about you know, what's happening where but women seem to make more suicide attempts and men seem to actually kill themselves More often and so the about four out of five suicides are men So sometimes as we look at the research what we sort of like look at So one hypothesis is that the manner of suicide sort of determines Is responsible for that statistic? so for example women are more likely to try to commit suicide by taking pills and Man are more likely to commit suicide by using a firearm And if we just sort of think about that from a medical standpoint if someone tries to commit them commit suicide by a pills the window to save that person is far larger than someone who you know uses a gun because like You know, it's just GG depending So some people have argued that because of the variance in attempts That's what sort of alters the statistic in my experience I think it's a little bit more complicated than that and I think that as we get to the reasons of why people commit suicide, I suspect that At least in my clinical experience and I also suspect that epidemiologically that men There are more men who are more serious about taking their life than women on average It doesn't mean that women aren't serious about taking their life. I'm just saying that that There seems to be something different there, which I think is sort of borne out in the statistics Could it have to do with just the manner and psychologically both genders are exactly the same? It's completely possible. In fact, there's good evidence for that theory My experience as a clinician and we'll get to the kind of the how or sorry the why and we'll sort of see that Suicidality also is not necessarily due to psychopathology, which I know sounds weird, but it's not all suicidality is due to mental illness So let's talk a little bit more about who commits suicide So, you know men tend to be more of four out of five or men I think we're seeing a rise in suicidality like in younger populations as well Just as other kind of interesting examples. One is that there's a black box warning on Antidepressant medications called serotonin selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors that for the few weeks after you start taking an ssri Adolescents especially are more likely to commit suicide So there's something really interesting there that like if you kind of think about, you know The mind of someone who may be suicidal you may have thoughts, but if you're severely depressed Your low energy level and your like lack of motivation Combined with the suicidal thoughts is almost like a protective mechanism that you may want to kill yourself But you have such low energy or your motivation is so low That you never actually like get up off your ass and and make an attempt So there's a really interesting phenomenon that's been observed when you actually treat someone with depression with or treat adolescents with depression with medication Is that there's actually a temporary spike? in suicidal behavior Which suggests that and the best kind of theory that i've heard is that this the spike actually happens because you're sort of dealing with That motivation first so people actually get a little bit more energy But the suicidal thoughts take longer to treat And so if if you really have to be careful if you're a prescriber and you're prescribing antidepressants to someone in adolescence to really watch Them carefully for like two weeks and then it seems like the effect kind of goes away in terms of like then it really starts Treating the suicidal thoughts and depression as well But it's a really interesting thing for you guys to be aware of that if you're starting antidepressant medication So here's kind of like the first kind of like psa Is be a little bit careful because there may be something weird going on in the suicidal thoughts I don't know if they become stronger or you may actually feel like a little bit more motivated to act on them Which is kind of weird right So it seems like younger people tend to be committing suicide more often. So it seems to be getting slightly worse and It seems to be men more than women. So when we look at something like the gamer community, we don't really have A good idea about you know who? Like what the suicide rate is specifically in our community at least I haven't seen any convincing research in that We don't really know but hopefully over time we'll learn more about that and we'll figure out how to intervene a little bit better So now what i'd like to do is actually screen share for a minute And we have an awesome one of our coaches Is actually a suicide researcher and so he's done awesome work as a coach and kind of does research on the side So he put together an awesome presentation to educate our coaches and what i'd love to do is Is he you know, he goes by james So james has done an awesome job of putting together this presentation And so what i'd love to do is share like one or two slides from the presentation with you all, okay? So let's kind of start with this So suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the united states with about 50 000 people dying by suicide I think this number has actually gone up a little bit since the presentation was made Um, this is the key thing so our pop, you know When we talk about like who the audience is of people who uh who watch stream and who healthy gamer reaches We tend to reach people who are like, you know, hopefully like 13 to 40 for the most part But a lot of parents watch our stream now, too So when we think about you know, what is the most likely thing that will kill you? I think it is probably accidents is number one for the leading cause of death And number two is suicide and so, um if we kind of look at like This is an important graphic. So trends in the leading cause of death over time in the usa So this is usa specific what we kind of see is like I was saying earlier like we're we're winning the war against like stroke heart disease cancer But suicide, I don't know if this is actually this is an interesting I i'd have to double check this this particular statistic whether this is a 33 percent increase because the causes of death of other things Are getting better. So the percentage increase is higher. But generally speaking, I think suicide has been increasing over time Which I feel pretty confident to say the next thing that we're going to kind of talk about So that's sort of like who commits suicide So, you know, we need to be really careful about that in this community The next thing that I want to talk about is why people commit suicide So this is going to sound kind of weird But there are many reasons why people commit suicide that may not necessarily have to do with psychopathology Okay So, um, there's a great paper by uh a guy named malzberger So malzberger is a is like a great suicide researcher. And so if you actually sit down and you talk to people who are Have tried to commit suicide or thinking about suicide and i've sort of definitely noticed this as a clinician what you're what I was really shocked to discover is that The reasons are not necessarily mental illness So we sort of think about mental illness is the number one cause of suicide and I think that that's probably reasonable and yet I know it sounds kind of weird but like psychopathology isn't necessarily the only cause of suicide And what I mean by that is that if you actually talk to people what you'll find is there are all kinds of reasons And some of them have to do with like, you know self-worth, which is that like an organic brain disease? I'm not really sure Sometimes suicide has to do with like not having a way out For lack of a better term And so suicide sort of serves as an escape And so I think we have to be really careful about sort of assuming any suicidal behavior is that has a root cause of mental illness Because if we misdiagnose that if we assume that everything is mental illness what I think we end up doing is Like we're gonna leave out and we're gonna lose sight of a lot of important reasons why people kill themselves So as a clinician what I'd like to do is kind of start with this idea. Okay, so the first thing to understand is that suicidality Is not an illness It's actually a symptom Okay, and so what what do I mean by that? So if we think about like Fever for example like fever is not an illness It's actually a symptom that can have all kinds of different root causes So if I have a fever, maybe I have a lymphoma maybe I have A cold maybe I have covid maybe I have lupus There are many different diseases that lead to fever and so in that way if I have suicidal thoughts There are actually many different reasons why I may feel suicidal So for example, one reason is psychopathology So what we mean by this is we know that there are some kinds of mental illnesses, right? So we know that there are things like depression Or actually this is incorrect major depressive disorder is is better Right, so there's like major depressive disorder bipolar disorder. We also know that you have like things like addictions Sometimes you'll have things like schizophrenia, right and these are like arguably Biological organic Malfunctions in your brain that lead to a malfunction in your brain that sort of Allows you to create suicidal thoughts and potentially act on suicidal thoughts but if you kind of Another really interesting thing and I don't know that this mechanism is the same so So like this is what malzberger cause calls loss of the ideal self-state or broken life dream So some people Will have like let's say like aspirations, right? So they say like I want to be this or I want to be this And something will happen in their life where they feel like their life has become broken and irreparable And if you really talk to them, so a lot of people will assume That this thing from a mechanism standpoint is the same as major depressive disorder But as a clinician what I oftentimes find is people who have major depressive disorder will become depressed even when nothing is wrong so, especially when i've worked with people who are like Suicidal sometimes I don't actually like do they qualify as depressed? Absolutely But sometimes they don't really respond to medications and what it really is is like Their perception of life has become so shattered that they don't believe it is worth living Now the this further gets complicated that sometimes this can actually trigger a major depressive episode But it's not that the major depressive episode is like shattering your I mean it can actually go both ways But I know it sounds kind of weird, but in my experience sometimes as someone like so for example You know, I was working with a particular person who was accused of sexual harassment And was essentially like fired from their law firm or put on suspension And they were it was sort of a situation where it was kind of like guilty until proven innocent They were sort of ostracized it turned out that um, you know, they didn't actually do anything inappropriate But their life was sort of shattered like they had lost their job like they had lost the respect of their colleagues And so like this person's life had fallen apart. I don't know that this was actually the result of an organic brain disease Um, I don't know that it was the cause was like a neurochemical imbalance But it really feels to me more like a broken life dream There are other kinds of weird psychoanalytic sort of stuff But other other causes of suicidality are going to be um, sudden defense breakdown. So what do we mean by this? So sometimes we have something called chronic suicidality and what that means is like I have um, you know I think about killing myself And even though I think about killing myself, there are a lot of things like a lot of people So suicidal thoughts are remarkably common. I think something between like 10 and 30 percent of the population Has suicidal thoughts or has had suicidal thoughts at some point And so if we kind of think about it suicidality is actually like a balance between pro-suicidal Factors and anti-suicidal factors and we'll get to that in a second in terms of how we deal with suicidality But sometimes what can happen is that like, you know You've got this balance between like reasons that you don't want to live and reasons that you do want to live And sometimes that defense mechanism one of the things that you kind of use to hold the suicidality at bay Kind of falls apart. So like a good example of this that i'll sort of use is like alcohol usage So, you know in your normal mind You can kind of keep the suicidality at bay But in some situations if you like alter, you know your state of consciousness through alcohol or some other disinhibiting substance The suicidality can kind of break through and then you can sort of result that you know Can it can end in an attempt? So I know it sounds kind of weird It's not necessarily like, you know, you can say that addiction is like an organic disease But alcohol in a temporary sense, this isn't an addiction This is just like I can be not addicted to alcohol use some mind-altering substance and then it causes something in my cycle psychology that keeps the suicide at bay from like It kind of breaks down my defense mechanism and I end up acting So and I know it sounds kind of weird but like just you don't have to have major depressive disorder to have suicidal thoughts So the next thing to kind of think about in terms of why people commit suicide is Anger turned against the self. So If we think about why people commit suicide some people find their life to be like intolerable, right? Like this life is not worth living anymore And sometimes if you go back to freud's earliest theories on depression, I believe it was freud, although I may be misquoting here um Who basically said that he he sort of discovered that depression is anger turned against the self So like instead of being angry at the outside world, like if you look at the mind of a depressed person, they're actually like angry towards themselves So if I get fired from my job instead of blaming my boss For being incompetent or feeling threatened by my competence, which may actually be the reason that I got fired I what i'll end up doing is blaming myself. Oh, i'm so bad. I'm so dumb I I can't do anything properly like I deserve to be fired and so sometimes in the case of um suicidality what we actually see is anger turned against the self with like revengeful intent so what this means is like sometimes we have these ideas about ourselves that are like Like I i'm such a bad person that like you almost want to like punish yourself for being so bad And this it's kind of really toxic, but if I really it's kind of sad But when I work with some people what I really find is that when people have like this self-loathing and self-hatred They don't believe they deserve to get better They actually believe that they like deserve punishment And so sometimes suicidality is not about like oh woe is me I no longer have a life to live Sometimes it's not like a sudden breakdown of a defense mechanism of like a dynamic equilibrium and sometimes what it is is like I deserve to kill myself because A pos like me doesn't deserve to be alive And so what we can kind of see is is you talk or as i've talked to people You know, i'll have someone like in the mdd camp who for example is like has a happy marriage And has a stable job And has like kids who love them and despite all of these positive factors They'll still be suicidal And so when I kind of see that like that's what I really think about like this seems to me like a malfunction This is not supposed to be the way that this person this person isn't supposed to feel that way, right? So if we think about a brain malfunction It's like your brain is not thinking the way that it's supposed to be But as you actually spend time with people who are suicidal what you actually find is that some people Like it sort of makes sense that they're suicidal because their life really has fallen apart They really don't believe that there's anything worth living for And we may call that depression. They may get diagnosed with depression, but I don't know that this is like an organic brain disease Does it's sort of a chicken or egg situation or like the brain in our psychology is complicated And sometimes it's not that like life isn't worth living So this is sort of like life isn't worth living Okay, and then over here what we have is I don't deserve To live you guys see how like these thoughts are different And over here is like and over here what we have is I'm suicidal despite Life being great, right? And so these are very different buckets in terms of what goes on in the mind of the person and then like, you know As we kind of go to other options. So like here's another kind of like psychological manifestation But i'd kind of say that another one is intolerance Of humiliation shame Shame Or envy and and so like this is kind of I know it sounds kind of weird But like this is sort of like a different bucket if you think about the emotion that's at play for these different buckets Like sometimes it's like hopelessness So if we look at the first column Okay, so if we look at this column, okay, this is transmitting. So if you look at this column, this is hopelessness This is going to be anger and this is going to be shame Okay, so these are going to be like a little bit different So the point here is that when we're thinking about, you know, why people want to kill themselves You know and what is the nature of their suicidality what we sort of arrive at Is that they're actually like a number of different reasons which are not all the same So this isn't just like one thing. It's not just mental illness that is causing suicidality And I think that it's the assumption that like, you know SSRIs will cure suicidality that despite the fact that our ssri prescriptions have gone through the roof over the last couple of decades Suicidal suicidality is still increasing which sort of naturally implies that You know, we're missing something here like as a profession and as a society we're missing something really important about suicidality so if people are kind of curious, this is the the paper that i'm pulling from which is A sort of an an examination of a particular narcissistic person And different causes, um, and it's by, uh, elsa ronningstam Igor weinberg and um, john malzberger I think all these maybe all three of these people are at harvard. That's number two Okay, so we started off by talking about you know, who is vulnerable to suicide? The second thing is like why people kill themselves and what we sort of discover in terms of why people kill themselves Is that there's actually like a lot of different reasons. So sometimes it's hopelessness. Sometimes it's anger Sometimes it's shame and humiliation and some degree of envy And I think each of these causes As we sort of think about the differential diagnosis of suicidality what we sort of result in is that different causes are going to have different solutions so once again, if you're feeling like Killing yourself or you have suicidal thoughts. This is like reason number two to go see a mental health professional, right like Understand that these things when you work with someone can be addressed. So for the person who's hopeless You know, we can sort of help them build a life dream again So a big part of what we try to do here at healthy gamer is like help people construct a life that is worth living Our original goal was like helping people with video game addiction And what we sort of found is the antidote to video game addiction is having a life that is worth living in the real world And so as you build that life, which can absolutely be done, right? It takes time and it takes effort and you may feel hopeless But like with a little bit of help and with a little bit of an intention you will be amazed at what you're capable of The biggest thing about people who are hopeless is that they don't exert effort Right, and so you can even beat yourself up over that So there can be some amount of hopelessness. They can be some amount of anger and self-hatred I don't deserve to live. I don't deserve to be happy And so that sort of has a different solution as well in terms of like learning how to gain compassion, right? so sometimes we'll teach like Particular meditation techniques that can help people like learn how to love yourself and learn how to forgive yourself There's a lot of stuff about this in one of the dr. K guides Around you know, anahata chakra meditations and things like that So like there are different antidotes to that There's also things like shame and envy which whoo-hoo Those tend to be some of the hardest things to deal with like they require a lot of self-reflection because it's sort of like you know, there's some amount of You know hopelessness is something that we want to fix Anger is something that we want to replace with compassion like we sort of want to do that But when I deal with people who are like really envious and suicide a suicidal because someone else's life is like better than theirs That's really really hard to deal with it requires a lot of self-reflection because it's like people hold on to their envy so much more So now what we're going to do is sort of talk a little bit about How people go about killing themselves and understanding sort of like a clinical approach to like suicide risk assessment And a couple of common myths that I want you guys to be careful about So the first thing to understand is that psychiatrists are notoriously bad at predicting Whether someone is going to kill themselves or not. In fact, overwhelming amounts of research have shown. I know this is kind of shocking That psychiatrists cannot see the future And so we don't really know whether someone is going to kill themselves or not And so the question sort of becomes well, like why is that? And this is where like research gets to be really really interesting. We have this kind of idea That when someone wants to kill themselves what they do is put their affairs in order. Okay, there are signs. Absolutely. We're going to get to those So like they put their affairs in order because this is what the media sort of says right like you like you settle all your things You like you make sure no one's in the house you write all your like suicide notes and things like that But it turns out that so this there's sort of this idea that like people kill themselves like their suicidality kind of starts out here And then gradually over time it increases increases increases increases and when it gets to up here, this is when you kill yourself So a lot of people feel reassured, right? They kind of say like, okay. Yeah, i'm suicidal but like i'm over here And since i'm over here, it's okay. I don't need to get help yet because i'm not up here And i'll know I need help when I start to feel worse and things like that So there's a sort of this myth that like suicidality builds up over time and people like make a calculated decision to kill themselves whereas if you look at the data What you actually find is if we look at the decision to make the most recent suicide attempt the most common Is that like, you know, I I don't know exactly what the y-axis is here. It may be Number of people so if you look at like, let's say this is like 30 people who tried to kill themselves What you find is that 12 out of the 30 people decided to make the attempt within one minute of the attempt um, you know the vast majority of people decided within half an hour or Within two hours to make the attempt So what we actually discover? Is that like most of the Like attempts of suicide are actually drastically Impulsive decisions and what we actually see is Out of this sample No one was planning suicide for more than three days Right, so like what this means is that if you guys have been struggling with suicide For a long period of time and you think to yourself like oh like since i'm not planning it I don't need to be worried I know it sounds kind of weird But you should absolutely be worried because what the data actually tells us if you take people who tried to commit suicide Who survived and you ask them? This is how the study was done. When did you make the decision to kill yourself? The vast majority was like within 60 seconds And so it this is a kind of another thing to kind of look at so if you look at suicidal ideation over time Okay And this is people like checking their suicidality like four to eight hours apart What you basically see is that like the suicidal score like is all over the place Right. So like this person will be very suicidal this moment and will be like not very suicidal four hours later So basically like the key takeaway here is that the first important myth to address is that like If you're telling yourself that because you're not planning to kill yourself you are safe That's something you need to be really careful about So what you want to really do is go see a clinician either way Like if you've been dealing with suicidal thoughts for a long time I know it sounds kind of scary, but like you just never know like when we come to that sudden defense breakdown You never know when the stars will align and like something will crack through and you will actually make an attempt So what I strongly encourage everyone to do is just because you've been feeling that way for a long time and nothing nothing has happened yet Is not a sufficient reason to not get help So even if you feel like it hasn't if you have it under control If you feel like You know, it hasn't happened yet. So there's a famous saying from the stock market You know like people in finance will say that the stock market past performance is not an indicator of future gains Right, and I think that's absolutely true of suicidality as well When we're thinking about performing like a risk assessment You know, that's not really like that reassuring because we just know as clinicians that it's sort of like on a given day Like something may happen in your mind. We don't really know And you can kind of result in that in an attempt. So what do we look at as clinicians? So we tend to look at means of access and this is why means of access is like the number one protective thing So if we think about if we now understand that suicidality is impulsive and most people decide to kill themselves within 60 seconds of making the attempt Having a gun at home is part of the reason why suicide is like so dangerous So much more likely if there's easy access to an attempt If you have a gun at home if you if you can like Make a decision and 60 seconds later you can actually make the attempt if you have the means to do that That's incredibly dangerous So when I think about like suicidal like like probabilities what I really try to protect against because remember like what we've got is like your mind Working against you and your mind working for you So as a clinician what I really try to do is buy time for my patients to like Get their head above water and reach out for help And so if someone has to you know order something from the internet In that 24-hour period their suicidality will fluctuate and they'll reach out to me and they'll say like hey I had like a really scary like near miss and then we'll kind of talk about it We'll help them through it and then they end up generally speaking doing well Okay, you know when it comes to a risk assessment we think about things like And this is for you guys to understand too if you're thinking about a particular there's a big difference between it would be okay So let's talk about like the scale of risk. Okay, so If I went to bed and I never woke up I would be fine with that That's something that we call passive suicidality. It's not that you actually want to die. It's just sort of like You know if you unplugged things like you would be okay with it Then they're sort of like I wish I went to bed and never woke up So at that point it's sort of like a desire, but it's not really like an intent, right? You're not trying to not wake up. It's just like we move from a passive suicidality to like sort of a wish And then the next phase is like I actually don't want to wake up like i'm gonna try to not wake up Right, so then we sort of cross over into intent which is like scarier And then like the scariest thing is like plans and then means So then like if you kind of think okay, I am going to not wake up in this particular way Right. So like once you start to think about a plan that increases your risk of a bad outcome And then once that plan becomes available, that's when things get really scary And it's it's usually towards those like later stages that we sort of really think about things like hospitalization, you know just a another important reminder here that like You should not be using this risk assessment to determine Whether you should go see a clinician or not If you were anywhere on this axis in any way, you should get a professional evaluation Because we know how to ask questions that will sort of help us figure out where you are Because I know hopefully you guys if you guys have been watching the stream for a while A big part of this problem is that people don't know what's in their mind Right the whole point of the stream if you think about like how to benefit How do people benefit from coming on stream watching stream? It's that we help you understand the things that you are not aware of in your mind And this is why I cannot urge you more strongly that if you are anywhere on the spectrum Or even not on the spectrum It's completely reasonable and I urge each and every it doesn't now that I think about it Like just go get evaluated like even if you don't think you need to Right because you may be missing something The other reason to go get evaluated or reach out for treatment I know this sounds like absolutely crazy like it sounds absolutely crazy is that you don't have to live in this mindset So for people who are chronically suicidal and think about never waking up again You don't have to live that way Right. So like there are trained professionals whose job It is to help you through that stuff and this is the really crazy thing right is like our mind does this really stupid thing where it's like If I can't figure it out, no one can figure it out It's like i've been dealing with this for a long time. I've read so many books. I've watched so many youtube videos I haven't figured it out. So like I don't think anyone can help me. I'm unhelpable Like they can help other people but I have tried really hard to figure this out and I haven't been able to so I don't really think there's any point in seeing a professional Be careful because if you have that thought if you think there is no point That is actually You should do the exact opposite If you think there is no point to see a professional you should actually go see a professional If you're on that axis, you should absolutely go see a professional Right and when it and we'll get to this in a second in terms of like what you can do Or I guess we can do so so now like moving on to like point number four is like what do you do? In this situation, right? So the answer is going to be like sort of a broken record here is like you go get help So like in the same way that if like if you've got a flat tire like maybe you know how to change it to yourself But if let's say your engine is busted, right? Like you go see a mechanic like there are as as human beings We have a society we have a community and we have a diversification of our labor pool Like if you want to eat a burrito you go to a place where people know how to make burritos or you make it yourself right if you want to you know Get if you've got covid like you go see a medical doctor because they're going to help you with covid You go to the appropriate person for the appropriate thing And if you're dealing with feelings of hopelessness or suicidal thoughts the appropriate place to go because there's a profession of people whose job it is And who's been spending years of their life to train and get good at helping you so you should go see them Right and be careful about all of the reasons that your mind may populate and if your mind populates these reasons then you should Really like notice that and recognize that this could be a process a part of like the negative process So if your mind is telling you there's no point if there's your mind is telling you that you don't deserve help And that you deserve to feel this way because you're such a pos and you like, you know Like other people deserve help, but you don't deserve help like that's like just recognize that and then don't give into that So I know this sounds kind of weird but I encourage all of you all to really think about What is it that dictates your life? Do you want to live a life that's based on like what your emotions tell you and I know it sounds kind of weird But based on what your thoughts tell you Because the mind is just a thinking machine. It just generates thoughts it generates all kinds of random crap Like your mind will say like I want a burrito or it'll say like I want to play dota or like I don't want to do this And do you want to listen to your mind? So be careful, right? Because sometimes you want to listen to your mind and sometimes you don't But you don't want your mind and your emotions to be in control of you you want to be in control of them So the last thing that i'm going to kind of talk about is like, you know This sentiment that you can handle it is not a sufficient reason To this is not the last thing. This is the second last thing The sentiment that you can handle it is not a sufficient reason to not see a mental health professional Because it's just dangerous like statistically it's very dangerous So the last thing that i'm going to talk a little bit about is like how to help someone else Who is dealing with suicidality? So this is really tricky because a lot of times people in our community are like good people and you try to help other people Out which is awesome, right? Like we love that. It's part of the reason that we're here Like our discord has a lot of people that try to help each other out Our subreddit has like people posting about their problems and like other people post on the subreddit to try to support them It's like fantastic like it's really great. It's beautiful We have coaches who will also like, you know, we're also kind of trained in our methodologies or sort of specifically there to help you out And and that seems to be going really well I had the I had the privilege of dropping into a coaching group this morning And and it was fun to really see like, you know How they're how people are progressing? So the last thing is like you may have a friend who is struggling with suicidal thoughts so the first thing to understand is that like A lot of people feel like I don't know how to help them or they won't let me help them Which is sort of fair because it's I know it sounds kind of weird But like it's your job to be their friend not their doctor so a lot of times I I notice that people get really kind of like frustrated or or they feel like really like stressed out because They're trying to fix this person's suicidality. They're trying to like because it's like so scary and you want to fix it But you're just not trained or capable And so I know it sounds kind of weird, but like you shouldn't stress about that, right? So like fixing someone's suicidality is not your job as a friend You're not trained in it. So you I mean, I guess you can kind of give it a shot, but like I wouldn't really recommend that Really your job as a friend is to be their friend and support them through it So this is where it's like encouraging them to actually get help because this is huge Where a lot of times people won't want to get help for any number of reasons because they feel ashamed So like, you know, you can kind of support them through that sometimes it's like practical like, you know Their their mental is not functioning properly so that like they just don't have the wherewithal to like sit down and like Call around and try to find an appointment So you may be able to help with that like it's kind of crazy, but you could ask them Hey, would you like my help in making an appointment like because 60 minutes from now like you could have two appointments We can make You know one phone call every six minutes and we can make 10 phone calls and out of those 10 phone calls It's there's a decent chance that 20% of the people like will have availability So it's going to be an uphill battle because in the mind of the depressed person in the mind of the hopeless person They may muster up the courage to make one phone call. But when like, you know, they don't get an appointment. They kind of give up So as a friend you can help them get into treatment. You can encourage them to get into treatment You can support them to get into treatment The second thing is don't underestimate the power of being a friend So while you may not be able to actually treat their suicidality and nor should you try Don't underestimate the value of you caring about them, right? Because in their mind remember that there's an equation between pro-suicidal factors and anti-suicidal factors But like one of the things that you're doing there just by being their friend and even like I know it sounds kind of weird But like i'll even say this as a psychiatrist like it's one of the most powerful things that i've like learned how to say It like when i'm dealing with patients with trauma, you know, they'll tell me about all this terrible stuff that happened to them and it's like We're 10 years later And I can't do anything about that and just sharing how much I wish I could like You know, because really the cure for this person is for me to invent a time machine go back in time and protect that from Protect them from like that ever happening That's the cure and I wish I could do that, but I can't And i'm actually completely powerless in this situation to like take that trauma away from them And being able to share that with them because like instead of like, you know you trying to help them You're actually joining them in the hopelessness And then what happens once you join them in the hopelessness is like both of y'all are down there together And y'all are hopeless together, so at least you can't change time you can't change the past They can't change the past either but at least both y'all are down there and like they're not shouldering that Powerlessness on their own you're helping them carry that powerlessness too And so then once you kind of get down there in there with them and you say like hey I can't take this away from you. I wish I could but i'd like to try to help you in some way. What can we do? What can we do And that's really the most important question you can ask as a friend Right and then like meet them where they're at and try to like help them Like if they if it's sort of like can I make phone calls for you? Can I help you get into treatment like what can I do? You know, what is it that you would like to do that? You're not able to do And sometimes it's like other kinds of things right? It's like hey, let's play like Let's make phone calls for 30 minutes and then like we'll play like one game of league and then like Depend after that like we'll take a break and we'll make phone calls for another 30 minutes And then like we're going to keep doing that until you have two appointments And then we'll you know, there's a lot that you can do as a friend So remember that your dharma as their friend is to be their friend It's not to cure them. And so be careful about what you're capable of and what you're signing up for Oh, so let's actually start with kind of a quick summary So today we're talking a little bit about suicidality and how to understand it. So we started off by talking about you know Who suicide affects who has suicidal thoughts kind of how that works? Um, we sort of talked a little bit about how women may be more likely to attempt suicide Although men are more likely to complete suicide successfully about 80 percent of suicides are men We also talked a little bit about why that statistic may be different So some of it may have to do with the means of suicidality like women are more likely to try to overdose Which means that the the window for medical intervention and the window to save that person's life Is a lot greater than using something like a gun which men are more likely to use guns women are more likely to try overdose via pills So we talked a little bit about statistics. I suspect that there's more to it than that I think that there's something going on in terms of like why men are so much more likely to kill themselves The second thing that we kind of talked a little bit about is like, you know, why do people kill themselves? And as we sort of get into the the mechanisms to recognize that suicidality is a symptom It's not a diagnosis and that suicidality is born out of all kinds of psychopathology as well as potentially like psychological Complexes that are not necessarily a discrete medical illness brain malfunction or neurochemistry imbalance So we talked a little bit about diseases like major depressive disorder bipolar disorder addiction sometimes things like trauma But also that when you actually sit down and talk to people with suicidality what you discover is that sometimes they Want to kill themselves because they don't feel like life is worth living that their dreams have been shattered And they don't really feel like they can ever put things together again Sometimes people kill themselves because they have an immense amount of self-hatred and it's not that life can't be put back together It's that they don't deserve to live a life that is like put together Sometimes it's born of things like envy And humiliation and shame and sometimes what can actually happen is is we always sort of have this war going on in our mind Between reasons to live and reasons to not live and sometimes we can have acute events That will sort of shatter some of our defense mechanisms that help keep us alive And sometimes i'll see this especially in the case of disinhibition through substances So like, you know If you think about alcohol alcohol will make you more likely to do things that you wouldn't do if you were like level-headed And suicidality includes that so like the number of suicide attempts that i've seen under the influence of alcohol is like staggering It's like through the roof and then we sort of talked a little bit about you know, how to think about suicidality So we talked a little bit about risk assessment and the main takeaway here is that regardless of how suicidal you've been If you've had those kinds of thoughts or you're currently having those kinds of thoughts, you should absolutely go get help It's a no-brainer and a big reason for that is one of the most common myths behind suicide Suicide, which is that people like really plan it out, right? It's like weeks and weeks of careful planning and i'm going to do this and settle my affairs in order Whereas if you look at the research At least in one study no one planned more than three days and like the vast majority like 50% or more 60 70 80% of people Made the decision within two hours And about 30% of the people made the decision within 60 seconds so the reason you should go get help is because You never know when your mind is going to change And the last thing that we talked a little bit about is okay Like so what do we do about it? Right if you're struggling with these thoughts like the short answer is get help Recognize that there are all kinds of thoughts in your head that will prevent you from getting help And if you're having those thoughts, that's not a reason to not get help. In fact, it's the very opposite So sometimes your mind may be telling you things like no one will be able to help because I haven't been able to fix it myself Your mind may be telling you I don't deserve help. And if you have any of those thoughts You should actually get help because you're having those thoughts And the last thing is you know, how do you support someone else the short answer is get them into treatment And in terms of how you do that, it's supporting them sometimes through like a very practical Hey, do you want me to like google stuff for you? Can we make phone calls together and sometimes it's just being their friend because it's your job to be their friend It's not your job to be their doctor And a lot of times people get really bent out of shape and stressed out because they try to Be their doctor when you just can't you're not trained to do that nor should you I don't I don't play doctor. I I don't accept patients that are friends of mine So like, you know people who I have working relationships with people who are my friends people who are my family Like I won't be their doctor. I will send them to someone else So That's our quick talk about suicide. I hope it's been helpful You know the goal of having this talk is because as we looked at earlier We are sort of losing the war against mental illness We are losing the war against suicide and despite many advances in medicine despite, you know A lot of new pharmaceutical medications and things like that some of which i've really seen like clinically do a fantastic job I really have seen some patients with depression who've tried like Five or six medications and a new drug comes comes on the market. It really does turn things around for them So it's great that like we have all these advances and at the same time, you know the Suicide has like increased as a cause of death by like 33 percent over the last like 20 years, I believe Whereas like, you know deaths due to cancer and heart disease and stuff like that have gone down by 20 to 40 percent And so the the first you know, we're going to start by educating educating y'all, right? So we as a community need to understand more about suicide We need to understand like what it looks like what it feels like what to do with it And I encourage all y'all to get some help because the the you know, the biggest the most common thing that I hear from my patients Who are reluctant to engage in mental health is like I wish I had done this sooner Because some of them will just I mean you guys will hopefully realize this too that you just don't have to live like this. It's like You know like you can fix this like you can feel better on a day-to-day basis Like the sun can be a little bit brighter. You can be a little bit happier. You can just enjoy things more You can actually live life with like more motivation and like food can taste better And all you have to do is just get a little bit of help. So someone's asking a question What if you don't have money? so um, it depends a little bit on where you live but uh, you know, most places actually have Most places meaning like even countries like so the u.s. Basically has free mental health clinics or community mental health clinics In most like cities actually so I don't I don't think people realize this but like you can just do like community mental health center And you call the community mental health center and you say hey, I have no money. I'm depressed Can you guys help me you'll be surprised because there are all kinds of programs out there, right? So we also have programs like rise above the disorder Um or rad which is like, you know a gaming non-profit that supports like gamers and actually pays for their treatment through like Scholarships and grants so there are non-profit organizations out there that'll help There are community mental health centers that are helped just call them up and ask um So I I wouldn't let that be a barrier Okay So what's a good way I can open up to a clinic or therapist about this kind of topic without making it seem like I am? In immediate danger, but it is still a very serious ongoing issue So it is their job So my job as a clinician is to keep people out of the hospital, right like the hospital is like a last resort It's not a first resort and so I would say Just share that with them Just say like hey, i'm not in any immediate danger, but this is a very serious issue and i'm afraid That you're going to think i'm in immediate danger. Just tell them They'll be like, okay cool. Thank you for sharing that that's like one of the most Reassuring things that I can hear as a psychiatrist. Oh great. This patient is taking this seriously Good That means I can rely on them. I can trust them. They respect the enemy that they're facing Uh, someone's asking why do you not want to be a doctor for people that you know? So being a doctor is about being objective, right? So what I want to do is like not let my emotions get in the way of like my clinical training And when personal relationships arise Emotions and other kinds of boundary issues arise that like make it hard for me to actually function as a competent doctor So there have been numerous studies done that show that Physicians who treat family members are more likely to miss diagnoses Than like a rando from the street Ah, so what if your friend doesn't want you to get them help? How do you convince them? Otherwise? That's a great question. You don't convince them. Otherwise So this is sort of where like what I would encourage you to do is like instead of trying to convince them to get help ask them Why they don't want help so anytime So anytime you have a disagreement with someone I think we try too hard in this society to like convince instead of understand And I want you guys to just pay attention to any argument like I really wish I could so I Anyway, wish I could share something with you, but I can't but So like I want you guys to just pay attention to any argument and like think about the arguments in your life Where you try to convince someone and they try to convince you What happens? Like it doesn't work Whereas it's kind of interesting because if you try to understand them Them they will automatically empathically like there's some circuit in their brain will flip where they will try to understand you You know And and so it's kind of interesting because I wouldn't try to convince them But I would still like state your perspective and you can say like hey, I see you suffering It hurts me to see you suffering. I care about you. I think this would help But if you don't want to like, you know, I can't make you Can you help me understand why you don't want help Because there may be something there that needs to be addressed right? So someone else is asking what if I am afraid of my parents not knowing or my parents knowing So like there may be something like that where they're like, you know They have some fear like they're afraid that they're going to be hospitalized or they're afraid they're going to you know Get kicked off of like whatever team they're on or they're afraid that You know their parents will find out And so then you can kind of like help them work through that right? Right, like you can be like, okay, so like what you know, what are you afraid of your parents knowing? What are you afraid of in terms of reaction or you think that they're not going to be supportive? You think they're going to call you weak? You think they're going to punish you for it? And then like, you know, then the conversation sort of becomes like we can maybe talk about, you know Parents who are against mental health treatment at some point the conversation then becomes like, you know, what's more important to you? I know it sounds kind of weird But like, you know when I work with kids who whose parents aren't supportive of mental health treatment It's actually like really amazing to see what happens because the kid actually like we work to the point where like they can be strong about it And it's sort of like my parents may react poorly and I can't control that but that's on them And i'm not going to let the opinions of my parents dictate the life that I lead And that's hard like it's it requires a lot of like internal fortitude and support from the outside to get to that point Where you can let your parents know and sometimes we'll even coach people into how how to have a conversation with your parents So when you tell your parents, hey, by the way, like I want to see a therapist they'll be like You don't need that and then like once again, don't try to convince them, right? So you're You ask the question you ask them like What do you think i'm feeling and what do you think I need? And they'll be like You know and just listen And be like, okay, I see so you think i'm feeling unmotivated because I got a b How would how would like how would that like how would you so you think that I don't need therapy because you think This is just a temporary part of adolescence If I were to tell you that what i'm feeling is very different from your what you're describing If i'm feeling something that's very different from what you think i'm feeling would that change your mind about whether seeing a therapist is appropriate or not it's kind of like a weird question, right because they're like It's kind of a weird question It's like a hard question to answer because if they say and then you may even get to therapy doesn't do anything And then you can ask them like what's your like help me understand why you think therapy doesn't do anything What do you base that on? Where does that come from? And just have a conversation with your parents and then like even i've had like, you know people working with super religious parents It will be like, you know, you just need to go to church more like like You know mental weakness can be solved through through god So you can say like, okay, so what's your understanding about like why people like, you know, why the profession of psychiatry exists? And then the answer can be something like well, it's because people have gotten away from god And then you can be like, okay And then you can be like, okay, so Do you think that like seeing a therapist? Necessarily means that i've moved away from god Or can I do both like what do you think about me trying it and like just being open-minded and seeing what the deal is? and oddly enough when you approach I've approached very religious parents in that way and found them to be you know like Quite receptive. It's bizarre you know, and even as a psychiatrist like sometimes like they'll come into my office, right and they'll be like prepared to do battle And so you just listen to them You can be like, yeah, like I completely agree would it surprise you guys that I spent seven years training to become a monk before I became a psychiatrist I actually agree with you that a lot of the reason that's that mental health is getting worse in this country Is because we've lost some element of spirituality And I think that like god puts that like gives us like a lot of options, right like And so we should use everything at our disposal It's crazy Like they'll be like and i'm like, do you guys think i'm evil? You just ask them And they're like no you seem like a nice guy and i'm like, okay So like how do you guys feel about your son? Coming and seeing me once a week for an hour And we're just like going to talk about stuff They're like, okay And i'm like you guys can come once a month, too And let's just check in like when you guys drop him off if you guys have any concerns You can let me know and they're like Okay Like it's really strange, but I I think just you know, if you have someone who's resistant to being convinced Don't try to convince them try to understand them Right and try to find some common ground Like because it's there Like just because they don't want to see a therapist for some reason does not mean that you know They they may they may want to avoid therapy for a reason but they may want therapy for another reason So it's about sitting with them in that space This is why it's kind of interesting that you know, one of the outcomes we're now measuring from our coaching program Is like how good our coaches are at getting people into therapy Because a lot of people a lot of times for whatever reason y'all feel more comfortable working with a coach than a therapist Therapist will work with you for a while like asriel is a good example If you guys caught that interview like was in coaching for a little while like went to therapy for a while And then came back to coaching and he seems to be doing way better The two are complementary. Yeah. So what if you're dealing with someone who's psychotic? So the other thing that I I for the sake of complete is I really should have included Is if you think that someone is at like imminent risk to themselves It's absolutely appropriate to call whatever emergency services is 911 112 like if you think someone is like actually going to hurt themselves You all should absolutely just call 911 or whatever the emergency services um and and like You know because like if someone is someone asks a question like what if someone is psychotic like if someone is high on drugs or Psychotic and like or something like that, like you should just call an ambulance And get that person to an emergency room because that's what the doctors in the emergency room are there for which is You know most of my bread and butter when I work overnight shifts in the ed And it's really fantastic. Like i'm so glad that you know, someone picked up the phone and like made a phone call Because they're going to come. I mean there's a decent chance. They're going to wind up in the emergency room either way And it's just going to be like, you know if their friend called Then we've got a good shot at saving this person's life Then if no one calls then we have less of a shot at saving this person's life and I can also say that You know, I would say 90 percent of people that get hospitalized are grateful that they were hospitalized when they leave in my experience I wish it was 99, but honestly, it's 90 10 of people really dislike it Yeah, so someone's saying I feel like I'm where Reckful was the day he died. I don't know where to go Seriously, dude, I'd pick up a dude or woman or you know, whatever you identify as I'd pick up the phone and I'd call 911 If you guys are where he was you Pick up the phone call. Seriously. That's like that's the only answer if you're where he was You
