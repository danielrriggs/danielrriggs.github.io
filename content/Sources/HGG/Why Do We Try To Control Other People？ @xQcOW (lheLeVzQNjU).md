 So if you were to blame for all of your problems, who has control over your life? Matrix. I'm just kidding. I don't know. You do. Me. Yeah. So here's the weird thing. Remember how we talked about the whole like, I'm going to make fun of myself or I'm going to sabotage this relationship because I don't want to lose control over it? You're taking control all the time. I don't care about the money. You guys want the money? I'll burn it. I'll teach you to look past me. Yeah, I've done that. You're right. I do have the power and the control. This is the weird thing. You don't. It's the way that you view the world. But I hate to break this to you, Felix, but you can't control anything except for yourself. Like literally. You're right. It's the way you see the world. And I don't blame you for seeing the world that way because it's a way that lets us fix the unfixable. Because when I can't control other human beings and they hurt me, that means I'm f***ed. It's a scary way to go through life.
