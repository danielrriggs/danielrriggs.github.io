 When we're growing up, we're not taught where happiness or satisfaction comes from. And so what we sort of learn instinctively as kids is that satisfaction or happiness comes from achievement, because this is when we get positive reinforcement, right? So if I get an A on a class, my parents are like, good job, little boy. And so then we learn this really, really important lesson early on, which is outward success leads to personal satisfaction and personal happiness. This definitely leads to esteem and respect from others. And then we confuse that stuff with our own personal satisfaction. And then what happens is we start to get stuck, because what that means is how I feel about myself depends on my performance. And so if I do well at work, I feel good. And if I do, if I don't do well at work or I don't get promoted, then I feel bad. And now this is the moment at which you surrender the happiness of your life as well as direction in your life. Because whether you get promoted at work is not under your control.
