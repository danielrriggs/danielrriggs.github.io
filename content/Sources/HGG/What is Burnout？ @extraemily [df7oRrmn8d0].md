 fundamentally what is burnout, it's people pleasing to the point of self-harm. That's what burnout is. I'm gonna do what makes this person happy at the cost of myself, and I'm gonna do it again, and I'm gonna do it again, and I'm gonna do it again until my tank is empty, and then I'm unable to do it. And then what's gonna happen is I'm gonna feel bad about myself, I'm gonna disappoint them anyway, and now I've sacrificed all this s*** and I end up disappointing them. And then I'm mad at myself. And then self-loathing comes in, why can't I do better? And then I have to wake up tomorrow and I have to make content I have to put on a f***ing happy face, which you would do such a good job of. It's a compliment, but it's also, it makes me sad. Just seeing how much you turn it on.
