 What could you do to actually make it easier on yourself? Yeah, it's a good question. One is the time that it was hardest for me was in building up to actually reaching out. But the time where it started to feel better was about 15 to 20 seconds into their response. Because I realized after that, that I had opened the door and that someone else was walking through it. That it wasn't just like open it and there was no one there. People ran the other way. You're putting something out and then you're waiting for a response. If you assume that the other person is going to have a positive response to you, that actually changes how you show up in the conversation. So if you and I are meeting for the first time aloq and we just did a few minutes ago. And if I assume that aloq is going to like me, then that actually turns out, makes me warmer in my interactions toward you. And that warmth is perceived by the other person and increases the likelihood that they will like me. And it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
