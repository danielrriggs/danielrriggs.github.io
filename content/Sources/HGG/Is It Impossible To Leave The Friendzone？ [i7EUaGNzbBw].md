 People say it's impossible to get out of the friend zone, you should move on. I mean, like, yeah, you should move on if someone's not interested in you. But I think that I want to say like 30 or 40 percent of the relationships that I've seen, people start out as friends. Like, it happens quite a bit. Like, people move out of the friend zone all the time. The problem that we run into is we get so caught up about doing it that we put all of our eggs into one basket, we want to force it. That is actually what sabotages it, right? So the right move is to confess your love, not confess, but let everyone know that you're having romantic thoughts if they're your friends. So I think don't confess your love. Oh my god, dude, so much to handle. Just let them know, like, hey, like, I sometimes have these feelings. And then watch them get flustered. Be like, hey, would you ever, you know, want to consider changing this relationship? And I wouldn't say more than being friends, by the way. Don't ever say more than friends, because it implies that other things are greater than friendship. Friendship is equal to romance, right? When you start treating it that way, people will receive it a lot better. Would you ever be interested in exploring something besides friendship? Right, just ask.
