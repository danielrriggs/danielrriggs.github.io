 The last thing to do if you plateau in therapy is simply find another therapist. This is something that I've done a lot actually with my patients where if we're stalling for a while we'll sit down and say, okay, like we're stalling, it seems like you're not making much progress. Let's think about how we want to approach this. We can try this, we can try this, we can try this. And we'll do something like come up with a six month plan. And at the end of those six months we'll reevaluate because not every therapist knows everything. And each therapist has their own strengths and weaknesses that they bring to the table. They have particular problems that they're good at dealing with. And sometimes actually the best thing to do if you're plateauing in therapy is to try a different kind of therapy or try a different therapist.
