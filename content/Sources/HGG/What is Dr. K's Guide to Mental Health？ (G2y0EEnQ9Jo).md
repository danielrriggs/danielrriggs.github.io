 So we have this thing called Dr. K's Guide to Mental Health, which is a course on mental health. But there are a couple things that are a little bit different about this course. The first is that when we think about a course, we think about it as linear, right? You start with lesson one and you go all the way to lesson 10. But our course on mental health has like kind of a branching logic, where when you come into the course, it gives you an assessment that sort of sees, okay, does this person suffer from anxiety? Do they suffer from depression? Do they have ADHD? And then based on their answers, it actually gives them a customizable track that sort of meets their educational needs. They also have choices where there are branch points where you can learn a little bit about, okay, how can I learn about meditation? Or do I need to learn about medication? And so it sort of offers this branching logic. And I think that what we've tried to do at Healthy Gamer is create sort of customizable experiences for people that are both entertaining and helpful.
