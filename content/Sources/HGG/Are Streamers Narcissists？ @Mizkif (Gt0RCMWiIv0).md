 Do you think we're bad people because of when we stream, like we're narcissists? So let's understand something. So if we look at the emergence of narcissism, narcissism is a defense mechanism. And when you are a human being who doesn't get to be a human being and you're constantly judged, there's literally like a number right now that determines how valuable you are. Right. And that number goes up and that number goes down. And so what happens is like the more that your life is tied to the streaming, your sense of identity is solely based on being a content creator. And then as that number goes up or down, it sort of creates this narcissism because you feel like you're a good person or not a good person, depending on how well you're doing. But can't that be said in the real world where people have to their jobs? Maybe it's because it's a little more strict. It's like anyone an entrepreneur. Yeah. So I think the big difference is that if you look at what not to be rude, but not be as rude as you want. What what else do you have in your life?
