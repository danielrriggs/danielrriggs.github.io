 So when you say, I don't want to burden other people, the way that you resolve that is not through courage. You don't overcome your fears of burdening other people. There's a relational component. So what you do is talk to them, ask for permission, ask for feedback. Hey, is it okay? Ask for permission if I talk to you about something that's like I'm struggling with right now. So the whole point of opening up to another human being is there's a relational component to it. It now involves more than one person. And what we try to do is solve all the anxieties in our head without ever interacting with the other person.
