 So a normal person works really, really, really hard, and then they accomplish something, they succeed in some way. And when they succeed in something, they feel good about themselves. And what do they do? They go out and they celebrate. On the flip side, someone with imposter syndrome, when they work really, really, really hard and they achieve something, how do they feel about themselves? They feel terrified. They feel like, oh my God, I got so lucky. I barely scraped by. I got so lucky that the professor likes me. Otherwise, I wouldn't have gotten an A. And so what do they do after they get an A? They actually double their efforts. They actually work twice as hard. They don't relax at all. They actually work harder because remember, if in your mind you are maintaining this elaborate facade that could come crumbling down around you at any moment, you can't relax at all. If you make a single mistake, everything's going to come tumbling down. You have no sense of reserve. You have no sense of resilience. You can't rely on things to work for you. And it's because you're kind of like screwing up, right? Like you're on the verge of everything coming crashing down. So there's no room for relaxation.
