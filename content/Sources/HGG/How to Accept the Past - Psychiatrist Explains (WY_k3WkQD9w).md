 until you accept what has happened to you, you're kind of stuck in the past. If only I had dot dot dot, if only I had studied harder, if only I had taken classes seriously, if only I hadn't dated this person, if only I hadn't done this, this, this, then I wouldn't be in this scenario right now. And so what your mind actually spends its time doing is instead of focusing on the present and focusing on what you can do to get out of this, all it thinks about is what you should have done differently to avoid the situation. Which if you think about it as cognitive energy, that will never help you. Because you can't actually go back into time. It's like all of your problem solving energy is going to rewrite the past, which is physically impossible, instead of trying to figure out what to do in the present. So this is where acceptance comes in. So acceptance sort of takes all that crap from the past and then kind of like lets it all go. And then you kind of accept where you are now.
