 And so if you're someone who loves all these green flags and you end up with breaking up with someone after two years because they're not perfect in some way, what do you end up doing? You end up adding one more thing to the list, right? The problem wasn't that I can't handle conflict resolution or that we couldn't navigate things or I couldn't compromise and maybe lower my standards. Oh my God, that sounds so bad. The internet is telling me that I never have to compromise or lower my standards in any way. That's not the problem. The problem is that this person was perfect in six out of six, but I missed number seven. And so now what I'm going to do is look for seven out of seven and I really want someone who does this. And the whole cycle repeats. This person is even more perfect. You know, how do you handle conflict? Oh, I handle conflict. Great. Great. And then you go three years in and then everything falls apart and now you're running out of time because you're getting older. And now you really need to find the perfect person because you don't have time to wait around and screw around. This is a problem.
