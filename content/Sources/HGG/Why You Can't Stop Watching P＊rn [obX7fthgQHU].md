 So the real challenge about things like porn addiction is you are not motivated to actually fix it. And you may say, but hold on, Dr. K, I want to fix it. But let's understand this, wanting up here and what your body and your brain is motivated towards are two different things. I want to have a six pack, but I want to drink a six pack. So your motivational circuitry is not thinking. Our capacity for thought and logic comes from our cerebral cortices. These are the parts that make us human. Our motivation, uh, unga bunga smash, is where our motivation comes from. It's a completely different circuit. And a lot of people get confused by this because they get addicted to pornography. And they're like, porn is destroying my life. Can't stop. That's because your motivational circuitry is attracted to it. So you're consciously, you may look at that. You're like some pilot that is sitting in a cloud and looking at all the primitives in your brain that are attracted to breasts and penises and whatever. And you're like, this is a mess. What do I do? Because the motivational circuitry doesn't care.
