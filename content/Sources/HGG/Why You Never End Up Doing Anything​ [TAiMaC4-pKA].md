 I have to be someone. And since you have to be someone, you can't afford to try things. You gotta be successful. Therefore you can't fail. And if you can't fail, you have to guarantee success before you even try. And how many things can you guarantee success for before you try them? Almost nothing. So you end up never doing anything. If you never do anything, you never learn anything. If you never learn anything, you don't increase your chances of success. As your chances of success stay low, you can't even try anything because you're doomed to failure. So you gotta get rid of the ego. It's okay to fail. And then you'll be able to move forward.
