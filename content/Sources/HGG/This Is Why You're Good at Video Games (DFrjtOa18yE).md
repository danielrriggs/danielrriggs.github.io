 If you're good at a video game, people will look at you and will say, wow, that is so amazing. You must work really hard to be good at the video game. It looks so effortful, but when you're good at a video game, you actually don't expend a whole lot of effort. It's actually easy for you, right? But the question is, why is it easy for you? Because you understand. You understand the mechanics of the game. You understand the meta of the game. The more that you understand, the more easy things become. And this is the key thing about cultivating detachment. This is what the yogis figured out is that if you want to live an easy life that is also happens to be like more productive, then you need to actually start with awareness because as long as we are numb to stuff and as long as we don't understand how things work, we can exert all the effort in the world and it's going to yield very few returns.
