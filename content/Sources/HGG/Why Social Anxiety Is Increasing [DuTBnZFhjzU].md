 The one uniform thing that I think is responsible for the rise in social anxiety across our generation, starting with millennials, is getting worse the deeper down we go, the younger we get, is the use of technology. So what started to happen is we've stopped relating to other people like in person. We do things like DM each other on Discord. And when we use online-based communication, a lot of our empathic and social circuitry starts to rust. When human beings used to sit around, around a fire, and like talk to each other 2,000 years ago, there are all of these circuits in our brain that started to develop that measure tone, body language, facial expressions, and as those circuits develop, those things reassure us. As we move on to more online communication, those parts of our brain rust, because if I'm DMing 15 people on Discord, I can't measure tone, I can't see body language. So those parts of our brain start to shut off in the same way that you forget a language if you don't use it.
