 So if you say if I stream less maybe chat will think they can do something with their lives, but I mean like I know you're influential misgiv But I I don't I don't think the majority of your chat is held back in life because they watch you Oh, no, no, no. I mean it smells like projection Where it's like if you can do something to save chat, then you can kind of save yourself I mean, I don't know why you're so concerned about chat Like why don't I mean, right? So that's what I mean is like you're not thinking about your it's it's weird because like on the one Hand you're thinking about okay if I if I stream less then it will be good for chat But what I'm wondering is like why can't you do something that's good for you? Why does it have to why do you have to think about what's good for chat? Well, it's more so like a both situation now Sure, right? So that's what makes it easy is when we convince ourselves that something is good for me and something is good for you that Dodges the guilt because now you're doing something that's good for you that you want to do But if you make it good for chat, then you don't have to feel guilty Dr. K supposed to be on my side, but that's not their side. I am on your side
