 And if you all have been watching our group coaching streams, you'll understand exactly what we mean. It's that oftentimes what you need is not what you want. And the whole reason you're stuck is because what you need is not what you want. So you keep looking for what you want and you don't realize what you need. And so that's what's kind of like frustrating honestly about coaching. Some people will come in and they'll be like, I thought you were going to fix this problem. And that's like, hey, I need tips to get into a relationship. And what they may actually need is not like tips to get into a relationship. Their problem isn't that they have trouble getting someone else to love them. The problem is that they don't love themselves. So anytime you go out and you meet someone else, the person that you're presenting is someone that is unlovable. And then you're like, how do I get people to love me? Well, you start by learning how to love yourself. You start by recognizing that you have value.
