 And this is where people get really, really tripped up. Everyone thinks if someone's life is good, that's why they're happy. But the truth is, is that it goes the other way. As you become content and happier in your day-to-day life, despite your circumstances, the instrument that you use to improve your life becomes way stronger, right? So when I get dumped, what is the best frame of mind to actually healthily move out of that? If I'm anxious, if I'm depressed, if I'm catastrophizing, I can't actually improve my circumstances. So the happiness actually comes first. And if you can sort of discover that, even 1%, 10%, 50%, your mind will be free of anxiety, free of depression. As your mind becomes free of those things, you can suddenly start actually making your life better. You can start acting in a forward momentum. And the problem is that right now, the anxiety paralyzes you from even improving.
