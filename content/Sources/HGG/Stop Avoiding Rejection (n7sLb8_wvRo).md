 So the other problem that we run into when we don't let people reject us is we become manipulative and we create relationships that are doomed to fail. What do I mean by this? If I don't want to give someone the chance to reject me, what I'm going to do, I'm going to hide something, right? Oh, yeah, that's not really me. Or I'm not going to share this little tidbit, because if I share this, they could reject me. They may like it, they may not like it. But then what happens is you create a relationship that's based on a lie. And then what happens is now like you've got to cover this thing up and they can never find out. And you're playing this game that if I can force them or trick them into investing a lot into the relationship, when they eventually find out there's so much in the relationship already that I'll be able to ride it out, not a good strategy. Give them the choice to reject you. I know it's hard, but your relationship will actually be healthier. Instead, what's going to happen is you'll build something up for a while and then they're going to feel betrayed. So now there is a possibility of rejection and there is a guarantee of betrayal. So I know it's I know it's hard, but you've got to give people the chance to reject you, because that's where like respect comes from.
