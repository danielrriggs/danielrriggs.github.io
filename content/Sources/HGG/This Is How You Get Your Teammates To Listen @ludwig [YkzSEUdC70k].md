 How do I get my teammates to cooperate with me and work with me in game to successfully win the game so I can get points and be happier? The first mistake that people make is that they tell their teammates what to do. Don't ever tell your teammates what to do. Ask them questions. I don't know if you've ever played Dota, but maybe this works with LoL or whatever. But like, so one thing that I'll do at the very beginning of the game is I'll ask people which hero they want me to pick. I'm like, hey, I can play these three things. Which one should I pick? What do you think the response is when I ask that question? Like, lock whoever you're most comfortable with. 90% of people don't say a f***ing word. Oh. Just completely ignore it. But, and so people assume that now I've made a mistake, but no, I haven't made a mistake. Because I've already signaled to them because they're just f***ing confused. Who the hell does that? Right? Yeah. That would be a bit weird. It would. And so people are like, this person is asking for my opinion to try to make my game better? Like, what on earth? All right. So, but it lays a foundation for communication.
