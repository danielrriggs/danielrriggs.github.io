 It is amazing what you can accomplish if you just get a little bit of support, right? And the best analogy that I have, I don't know if y'all weight lift, but like if you're doing like, let's say, a barbell press, right? And like you're pushing the bar and you can't push it up anymore, you're on that last rep. How much help do you need from a spotter? Just a little bit, right? They just need a little bit of help and then you can get positive momentum. And that's what I've seen with suicidality. So absolutely get help. It is about tolerating and managing your internal emotional state, learning how to do that. Because right now, if we think about it, that internal emotional state prevents you from actually fixing the problems in your life. So you have to get the skills to master the self. And once you can do that, then life becomes way easier. And I've seen it done.
