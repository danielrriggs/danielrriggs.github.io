 Even problems like procrastination can be influenced by inability to regulate our emotions. So like when we're procrastinating, like we want to do something, but we're not really able to do it. And sometimes like what we use to procrastinate. So let's say I procrastinate by watching YouTube or Twitch. And when I procrastinate, what that actually does when I watch YouTube or Twitch, what it actually does is destroys my motivation, but soothes my emotions. Because when you watch like stuff on the internet and like look at memes and stuff, you kind of get some dopamine, you kind of like stop, you forget about all the problems in your life and stuff like that. But the problem is it destroys your motivation. So in order to cope with our negative emotions, we sacrifice our motivation. And what that looks like is procrastination.
