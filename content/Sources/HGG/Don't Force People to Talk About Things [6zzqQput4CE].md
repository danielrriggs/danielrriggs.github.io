 So when you force people to re-experience trauma before they are ready, and this is important as well for certain techniques of meditation, that's why I do not do open awareness techniques of meditation with traumatic individuals. Their mind is working really, really hard to pack away those those memories. They've worked really, really hard to like bury them in the basement and put locks and chains and weights on top so that the trap door can never open. And so when you get clinicians that force people to process their trauma, or you get meditation techniques that let the trauma come up, then you actually re-traumatize the person, trigger all of those physiologic disruptions, which result in neuroscience changes. Those neuroscience changes will in turn affect your behaviors, your patterns of thought, etc. So don't do that. Don't force people to talk about things.
