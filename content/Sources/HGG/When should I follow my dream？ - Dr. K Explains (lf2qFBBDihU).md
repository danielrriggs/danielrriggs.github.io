 If you believe in something in this world, run with it. This is the generation that I've seen that it's actually dreamed the biggest because we've seen that success is actually possible. There are kids that grew up watching video games and have said that I want to play this video game as a career, and that's actually possible. We have people who have wanted to write books and have sat down and actually written books and published them and become bestselling author. We even have different kinds of musical artists that stream on Twitch that started small and blew up. Dream big, Class of 2022, because this is the one chance that you're going to have. This is the one generation that is going to have the best actual options of letting your dream come true.
