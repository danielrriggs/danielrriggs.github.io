 How would you help high achieving people like pre meds pre law pre farm who struggle with self-worth? Is there a certain meditation you would describe? I got drunk with a lot of pre meds a week ago and they were telling me stories of therapy drugs With not success they were happy with they are struggling with their issues. Okay So Here's the thing so a lot of times so I had a buddy who Went to Harvard Law School and I asked him like after his first semester at Harvard Law School like how he was enjoying it And he actually said like it's kind of crappy And I said like what makes what makes Harvard Law School so crappy and he's like One of the work like the people are just awful and I said what do you mean? The people are awful and he says one of the worst things you can do to someone Who has always been the best in their class is to make them feel average and so what happens with a lot of these high achieving people is That they're used to being high achieving like in middle school. They had straight A's in high school They had very good GPA's and so they end up In in like a competitive college, right? You go to like an Ivy League school or something like that and you're with a bunch of other pre meds and then suddenly You have this identity built on being smart and smarter than everyone else and suddenly you're fucking average And the funny thing is the more high achieving you are The worse the problem becomes because I want you guys to envision someone who ends up at Harvard Medical School So not only were they the top of their class in middle school and then in high school and then in college When they went to their Ivy League University and then when they wind up because you you rise higher and higher and higher And you're always the best and then you end up in a place like HMS and then suddenly you're fucking average So you've been used to not being average for even longer and it's becoming even a greater part of your identity So the biggest problems you see in self-worth are with the people who are the highest achieving The higher achievement goes the bigger the problem is with self-worth It's that simple Right that simple So, what do you do about it Well, that's a great question so I think the best thing to do a couple of things one is to Understand that a lot of people's identity is based on comparison So your sense of self-worth is in reflection to the people around you That needs to change you need to start to have an identity that's based on yourself in isolation Not in relation to someone else and if you think about people who are like falling behind Right. So a lot of people that I work with a lot of people on Twitch gamers things like that are Upset because they're behind So like I remember when I started I started medical school at the age of 27 Which means that the people that I entered school with who are pre-med like when we were 20 I had a group of people who are pre-med right my friends from pre-med classes and Then at 22 they graduate from college and they go to medical school and they finish medical school at 26 So I remember when I was 26 years old and they were moving on to read a residency and graduating they would ask me Hey, man, what are you up to nowadays? And when they're graduating from medical school, I would say I'm applying to medical school I didn't even tell them that because that's fucking it's so so shaming Six years ago. We were in the same shoes and now I'm still applying to the school that you were graduating from That's the comparative mindset and then you feel shame right And so you just got to stop comparing yourself there are meditation techniques around that We'll do that today Okay Yeah, so then then the second part of this question is that they were telling me stories of therapy drugs etc that were not Succeeding yeah, because like a drug is not gonna fix that you guys get that like if you're used to being the smartest kid in the room and that's what your identity has been based on since you were the age of 10 and Suddenly at the age of 22 the entire person that you are gets called into question because your average a Medication is not going to fix that It's just not gonna fix it So Like a medication can help with some of the symptoms of that But it's not gonna fix it So what you've got to do is give people a sense of of worth or sense of identity That is based on themselves as opposed to not on comparison if you could do that they're gonna be fine
