 When we have really, really strong helicopter parents that live vicariously through their kids, that tenacity of wanting my kid to be number one is directly correlated to their perception of what they had to give up. I'm going to make sure my child is the best in the universe because I got pregnant and had to drop out of college. So in order to make that worth it, that tenacity with being a helicopter parent is through the roof. Is that bad for the kid? Sure, but let's think a little bit about scientifically where that tenacity comes from. Where does that motivation come from? It comes from the sacrifice, right? So motivation can come from sacrifice, 100%. So if you want to find it, like, you got to pay the price. Pay the blood price. And don't be afraid. Mistakes are a part of life. That's how we know what to do.
