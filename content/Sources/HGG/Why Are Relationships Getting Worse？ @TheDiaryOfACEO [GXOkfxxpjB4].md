 Why are relationships decaying? See, human relationships, evolutionarily, were predicated on the fact that humans needed each other for survival. So fundamentally, what has always bound human beings together is like, I need you and you need me, otherwise we're not gonna survive. But what's happening in the world today is we no longer need each other for survival. So I never even need to leave my house. I can order groceries, I can order food, I can work from home, I can literally stay in my home or in my room, and I never need to walk out of the house. I never need to interact with someone. So once you remove necessity from the equation as to why human beings form relationships, so we're seeing a decay in relationships because we no longer need each other, right? So women no longer need men, you can have an independent life as a man, you no longer need a woman, you can get a flesh light if you want to, you can have an AI girlfriend, you have pornography, we don't need each other. And yet the human mind is the only organ of the body that in order for it to be healthy, it requires another human being.
