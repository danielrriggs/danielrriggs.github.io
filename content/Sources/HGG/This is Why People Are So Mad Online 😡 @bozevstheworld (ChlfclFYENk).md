 One of the earliest things you learn in trauma is that anger is risky. So what you see in trauma responses is that people learn to displace their anger into safe environments. Kids who are traumatized at home will bully the smallest kid in the class because I have all this anger. What am I supposed to do with it? I can safely express it if I'm picking on a little kid. Yeah. Whereas if I get angry at my parents for being mean to me, then I get punished. There's one place where I can safely express anger and there's basically no consequences, which is the internet. So I can rage on the internet all day long. I can rage about all these injustices. I can even rage at people. I can get banned and I can just make another account. And so I can go on expressing this impotent rage. You know, I think some people think that they feel better releasing it, but I think it actually turns into just a bigger rolling ball. I think that activating that angry part of yourself and putting it out there, it actually creates a bigger anger that you almost didn't have before. Like a bitterness too. Absolutely.
