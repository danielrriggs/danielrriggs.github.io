 So imagine what your life would be like if you were not always trying to shape and control other people's perceptions of you because that's what a lot of anxiety turns into. This is how people become doormats. I can't afford to have this person dislike me and since I can't afford to have this person dislike me, I can never set a boundary with them. Since I never set a boundary with them, I become a doormat and they start to become abusive because I don't check their behavior. There's never a consequence for their behavior and then the anxious person gets stuck. They become frustrated with themselves. They become frustrated with the other person but they don't know what to do about it. And so the real antidote to all the stuff at the end of the day is detachment. It's to separate yourself a little bit from the ego. Okay, so this person dislikes me, so what? Right? And this is what people may tell you. Why do you care about what this person thinks? And you're like, I don't know. I wish I couldn't, but I do. And then how do you solve that? How do you develop that detachment? You go back. Detachment. You go back. When did I learn that I cannot afford to piss anyone off?
