 Happiness comes from within. People may think it comes from without, but this is the wild thing. You may say, but no, but my happiness comes from the enjoyment of external things. Okay, so y'all gotta understand this. That is wrong. You will say, no, but I like apples. Okay, let me ask you a question. Where does the experience of liking happen, liking apples happen?

Oh, I love playing this video game. It's so much fun. And on hour six, I don't know why the fuck I play this video game. It's not even fun. The game is the same. Game hasn't changed. You had smurfs on your team in game one. You had smurfs on the enemy team in games two, three, four, five and six. Crazy thing, there was never a smurf. You just thought there was, right? Because surely when you're getting dumpstered, it's because there's an enemy smurf.
