 Success or perfection is something you've strived for and failed. And exactly what you said. Even to the point where like I'm so afraid of dropping this dish, I'm just going to break it myself. Yeah, with people too sometimes. Sometimes you meet somebody that you like or care about and it feels like I'm going to f*** up at one point or very soon and it makes you want to kind of give up on them already so that they're not disappointed down the line or I'm not quite surprised and I just throw them away. How does it feel to say that? It feels okay. I've been saying to myself for like years. I think it's something I do all the time. Like throw people away. I know I won't be able to like water that plant or maintain it or like I'm not good enough or whatever. Like imposter syndrome a little bit sometimes. Especially with girls also. For some reason you feel like you're not good enough for them and you know you're going to f*** somehow or some reason down the line and you don't know when or what and you're just like, ah, you know what? F*** it. I'm just going to ghost them and throw them away and it's like now I know it's done. I'm not going to get sad or annoyed by it when it happens or why. If I throw them away now and I prevent myself from having something good, then I can't break it.
