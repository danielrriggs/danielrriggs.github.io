 And the real tragedy here is that if you think about how you go about trying to improve your life, what you actually do is try to control the circumstances of your life, right? I want to get a job. I don't want to be alone anymore. I don't want this person to break up with me. And what we actually don't control at all is the conclusions that we draw from what happens in real life. Literally, the only thing that you can control in your life is the stuff in here. We can't actually control whether someone promotes me or doesn't promote me, breaks up with me, or doesn't break up with me. But that's actually where we spend all of our cognitive energy. And this is exactly why we end up stuck in life, because we put all of our energy into fixing things out there. Because that's really what we want, right? I want to get promoted. I want to get married. I want all of these things. And that's where we put our energy. But the real tragedy is that we don't actually pay attention to how those events affect us up here. It's the way that we are up here. It's our personality that actually determines our destiny.
