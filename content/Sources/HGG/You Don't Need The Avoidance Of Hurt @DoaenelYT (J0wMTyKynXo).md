 To be able to surrender and to be able to like really put yourself at the mercy of something else That's the ultimate form of being in control because like that's where you do have no control. It's not the ultimate form of being control It's transcending the axis of control and not control It's saying that so be it and if this person wants to dislike me They can dislike me if this person wants to judge me for this they can judge me Even if they say things that hurt me it will hurt so be it I do not need the avoidance of hurt to be able to control my life So this is why when we use this term moksha which is Sanskrit for enlightenment It is translated as both bliss and freedom because you are happy with pleasure or pain You are happy with acceptance or rejection because it is just the way of things it is what it is Okay
