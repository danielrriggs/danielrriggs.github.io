 So if you want to disable envy, notice your insecurity, notice the comparison, and then gravitate towards the appreciation. Recognize that, wow, this is something that I want. And instead of envying that person and your eyes being over there, notice what is beyond them. What is it that I'm truly appreciating? And then ask yourself, what can I do to get that thing that I appreciate? What's the smallest thing that I can do to move towards that which I appreciate? And something revolutionary will happen, which is that you'll start to move towards it. And you may say, but Dr. K, that's hard. I want all kinds of things and I don't move towards them. And the reason for that is because so much of your fucking cognition is caught up in envy. Where does the energy of envy get you? Nowhere. It fills your mind. It's all of this insecurity, all of this ego, instead of actually moving towards anything that you want. And so once you remove all of this ego from the equation, you'll be able to actually move towards your goals.
