 Male suicide rates are increasing. It's gone from about 18 out of 100,000, I think, to about 22 out of 100,000. It's on the rise. And what causes this? I know it sounds kind of weird. Honestly, I think a big part that is underappreciated is homophobia. You may say, what the hell does homophobia have to do with male suicide? So when I was growing up, everyone was so homophobic. And so what are men not allowed to do? Touch each other. As a nation and a society, we became so homophobic that dudes stopped touching each other. And so then what are you left with? The only place that you get touched is by your mom or by a romantic interest. And why is that screwing up romantic relations? It's screwing up romantic relations because now, let's assume hetero-normative for a second, the women in our life are responsible not only for our romance but are becoming responsible for the touch starvation that we have in all of the other dimensions in their life, in our lives. And so now this woman is responsible for fulfilling all of my touch needs because I'm not allowed to touch another man.
