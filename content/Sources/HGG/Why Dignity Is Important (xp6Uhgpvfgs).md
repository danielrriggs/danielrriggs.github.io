 Do you deserve... because this is where the self-respect comes from. Because if you respect yourself, do you deserve someone who will treat you this way? Or do you deserve someone better? Because if you let someone mistreat you and you think of yourself as low, then that's okay. But if you deserve better, then you're going to move on because that's the end of it. But I want her. I miss her. Okay, so what? But it'll hurt to not have her. Okay, so it'll hurt. Accept it. That's life. That's what living life with dignity is. Dignity comes with pain. It doesn't come with pleasure. People who seek pleasure don't lead dignified lives. Quite the opposite, right? When we're chasing dopamine or drugs or materialistic things, the respect of random people on the internet, when we chase after those things and we'll do whatever it takes to get other people to like us, that is the degradation of self-respect. When you place someone else's opinions and view of yourself above your own, and so you say, I'll do whatever it takes to get you to like me, then you lose your self-respect.
