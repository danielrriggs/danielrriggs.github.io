 And if you're someone who struggles with this, where even though you're doing better in life, it feels so exhausting, and other people seem to be playing life on easy mode and you're playing life on hard mode, you can still down the bosses and beat the level, but it costs you so much more. And you carry around this idea that like, I'm not enough in some way, this needs to be fixed. Both of them can absolutely be fixed with some simple organizational skills and like workflow kind of stuff. You can learn how to study with a distractible mind and work on your confidence. That's what will ultimately help you realize like, okay, I can do just as well as someone who's neurotypical in this world. I just need to play the hand that I'm dealt. Instead of copycatting, neurotypical kids. That's where ADHD kids get screwed.
