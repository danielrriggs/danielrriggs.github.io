 A growing number of ophthalmologists that I know are getting concerned about these oil glands in the eyes that will essentially die out because people are not blinking often enough. So when you play video games or look at a screen, the rate of your blinking actually goes down. And if you don't blink enough, your eyes will dry out. And the consequence of your eyes drying out is actually that there's these little oil producing glands in your eyes that will actually stop functioning. And so there's a growing number of people who require eye drops and stuff and external lubricants because this is happening. It all has to do with your blinking rate. So I try to minimize my screen time even when it comes to things like reading. So blink chat when you play games. Who can blink manually while doing anything? I don't know. Can you blink manually? It's hard.
