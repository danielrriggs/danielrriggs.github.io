 When I was growing up, I used to watch this show called Sesame Street. The thing about Sesame Street is when you're watching TV as a kid, Sesame Street gives you a story over 30 minutes. So my attention span was 30 minutes. But now if you look at things like apps, what we notice is that first there were blogs. And in order to engage with blogs, you had to read three pages. And that has now turned into Twitter, 160 characters. We started with YouTube, right? Where people used to make 20 minute videos. Now we have TikTok, which is like 60 seconds or less. As the pace of technology is getting quicker, our brain no longer needs to pay attention for extended periods of time. And if you watch your child on an iPad, they scroll quickly, right? They get bored of something. They click on the next thing. They click on the next thing. They kind of give into their boredom and they rely on the technology to give them stimulation instead of training their mind to pay attention to something for an extended period of time. So I think we are seeing a technological impact on our attention as a whole.
