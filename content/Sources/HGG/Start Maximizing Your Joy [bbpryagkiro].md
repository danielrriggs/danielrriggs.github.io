 We don't actually live to maximize our joy. We don't wake up in the morning and think to myself, how am I gonna pack as much awesomeness into today, today as I can? We wake up and we scroll and then a little bit of dopamine there and a spurt there and a little bit there. Now watch something, now I'm wandering over here and now I'm hungry so I might as well eat something. We don't actually try to even enjoy every day. We just avoid work because we can do it tomorrow and then we feel guilty about that and we manage that guilt with some kind of like lukewarm pleasure. It's like a half life with not enough effort and not enough enjoyment and not enough of anything. And so if you start to like live without the dimension of time, something interesting is gonna happen. You wanna go into hedonism and try, I'm saying have a great day. Treat yourself, you know, line up a great day. You say, what about tomorrow? You're gonna procrastinate anyway so, you're not gonna lose anything. You might as well enjoy yourself.
