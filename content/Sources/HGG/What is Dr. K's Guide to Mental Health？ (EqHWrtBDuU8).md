 All right, so this is Dr. K's guide. So we have four basic guides. We have anxiety, depression, meditation, and ADHD. So a big part of Dr. K's guide is that it's not just about the illness, it's about non-clinical perspectives on the illness. So what we try to do in Dr. K's guide is basically it's the way that I think about other human beings. When someone comes into my office, I have a branching logic in my mind. And then even if we go down to negative emotions, so people will say, oh, I've fallen behind. And if you guys were paying attention at the beginning of stream, look at that. There's actually a video for that. So we got tons of people who use the guide and they're like, hey, how do I give this to someone? We're like, you can't. And then our devs started working on it because people were like, how do we gift the guide? So if you guys know someone who could benefit from this stuff, you can gift it now. The problem with all of our Twitch and YouTube content is that it's standalone. So the most you can ever get is like Surface. The whole advantage of the guide is that you can go way beyond Surface.
