 If you want your brain to function better, if you have ADHD, you need to clean your room. Because even though you don't notice that stuff, your brain is literally suppressing all of that sensory input, which is a cognitive load. There are studies that show that when people with ADHD clean their room, their capacity to study actually improves. So if you study in a messy space with an ADHD, you literally have less ability to focus on the task at hand. Because when we're studying, we're using top-down processing. So we're telling ourselves, focus on this. But there's all this crap going on over here that we're trying to suppress. Don't think about that lamp. Don't think about that mail. Don't think about this. Don't think about this. Don't think about this. Just think about this. And so as the number of things that your brain has to not think about in order to focus increases, we become more cognitively fatigued. So stuff blindness is absolutely a thing. And the most important thing that you can do to fix stuff blindness is to clean your room.
