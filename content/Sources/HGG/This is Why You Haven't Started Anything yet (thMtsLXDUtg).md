 And then a year goes by and you haven't done anything. And then another year goes by and you haven't done anything. And then you beat yourself up. Man, if I'd started two years ago, imagine where I would be today. Easy for your mind to say that. The question is why didn't you start two years ago? And the reason that you didn't start two years ago is because you listen to the same damn mind. And that mind said, if you start today, it's not going to be enough because this is going to take four years or two years. You'll get that? In order to overcome this, you need to do something a little bit stupid. You need to do things that are not enough. This is honestly, if you want one bit of advice to transform your life, it is do things that are not enough. It's too late for me to get a six pack before beach season. So I might as well not exercise because your mind tells you it's not enough. It's not enough. It's not enough. Be a little bit foolish. Do things that are not enough. Do it anyway. Exercise a little bit. You'll be amazed at what your life will look like a year from now, two years from now, three years from now.
