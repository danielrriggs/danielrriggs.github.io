 Children who grow up in abusive households are very very anxious and why is that? So if I grow up in a safe household the world becomes a safe place So remember that when I'm a child, I'm learning the basics of life. I'm learning what amount of food I can eat before I throw up I'm learning like what it feels like to need to use the restroom Now, let's say I grew up with an alcoholic parent What that means is on one day the parent is fine because they're sober the next day They're drunk and they're pissed home becomes an unsafe place every time I go home I don't know which parent I'm getting so there's no security There's no safety and so parents are the people that are supposed to provide us a safe space from which we can venture out And explore the world and if we've got a home base that's safe then I can afford to like go and explore But when I have toxic parents, I learned that home is not a safe place and there's no space of stability If there's no space of stability the world becomes a dangerous place if the world becomes a dangerous place I can't go out and do things
