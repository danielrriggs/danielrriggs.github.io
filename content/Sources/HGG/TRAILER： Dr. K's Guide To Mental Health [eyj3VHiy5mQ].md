 So if you really want to take control of your life, the first thing that you have to understand is how does my mind work? These modules are a distillation, the essence of my personal journey to understand myself over the last two decades. They're kind of like a choose your own adventure of understanding a particular topic. Because in my experience as a psychiatrist, the best outcomes come from educated patients. And you are ultimately going to be the most important part of your treatment. Okay, fine, I'm in this place and this place sucks. What am I going to do about it now? Focus on building a healthy identity of yourself, where you can learn to unconditionally love yourself. If meditation has one good effect on the brain, it actually strengthens the hell out of your frontal lobes. You have to let go of the entire construction, right? Because what does it mean to have fallen behind? It's a construct of the mind. What does it mean to catch up? It's a construct of the mind. Because think what you're doing here, right? You're doing so much problem solving. There's a certain method, there's a certain secret, there's a certain technique to being able to find that peace in spite of the emotion. We can go to the birth of that scar and we can actually try to rewrite history a little bit, change our minds conceptualization of the truths that we learned in the past that cause us suffering today.
