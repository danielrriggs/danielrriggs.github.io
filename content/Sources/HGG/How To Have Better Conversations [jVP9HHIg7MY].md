 And the basic problem with social anxiety is all we're left with is our analytical portion because we're not actually receiving data. So we want to make eye contact. We don't want to make eye contact for very long. A lot of people are wondering like, okay, how long should I make eye contact? You make eye contact for one second at a time, and then you move on to something else. If you're a part of a conversation, you just look at whoever is talking. And when someone is talking, what they're going to be doing is automatically making eye contact with everyone around them. So you want really brief periods of eye contact. If you're in a one-on-one conversation, you don't want to stand directly across from them. You usually actually ideally want to be at like a 45 degree angle. So you can kind of look over at them while they're talking, and then you can like look to like a neutral situation. And you want to sort of do this for like a one second period so it doesn't feel overly excessive. And you may sort of struggle with this a little bit at the beginning. You don't have to count. It'll actually feel natural and your body and brain will actually like take over on its own. So how long you want to look over here? Okay, you're saying this? Well, that's really interesting. So when you speak, you can kind of like look to a neutral location, okay?
