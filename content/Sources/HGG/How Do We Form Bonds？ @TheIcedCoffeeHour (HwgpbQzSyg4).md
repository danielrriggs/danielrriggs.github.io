 So there was a study where they took people, they had people have a first date. The control condition is y'all are gonna meet on a bridge made of stone. The experimental condition is you're gonna meet on a bridge that is a rickety wooden bridge. What they found is that the level of attraction between the two people was way higher on the rickety bridge. So anytime you can create a shared emotional experience between two human beings, they bond. This is why people fall in love at rehab. So like rehab is a place where everyone's like addicted and they're going through some stuff, but boy do they fall in love at an alarming rate. And if any of y'all have ever worked at rehab or people are listening, y'all know exactly what I'm talking about because everyone who is working at the rehab is paranoid about the patients falling in love, sneaking out, all kinds of stuff. We're paranoid about it because it happens all the time. Shared emotional experience is what creates bonds.
