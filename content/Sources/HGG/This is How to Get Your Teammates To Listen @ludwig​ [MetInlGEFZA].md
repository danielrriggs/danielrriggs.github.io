 You know, if I think someone is making a mistake, I'll ask him a question about it. So if one of my teammates is like doing something, I'm like, hey, I noticed you're doing this. You keep on going back to the lane and you keep dying. So instead of telling them, hey, stop going back to the same place and feeding, you can say, hey, I noticed that you've been ganked twice. Sorry for not having wards in the right spot. Do you want me to like place wards or can you wait 60 seconds that I can place wards? Or do you want to move to a different part of the map? Hey, I noticed your bottom on the leaderboard. How about you leave me alone? I feel like it would be the reply. Nope. That's if you tell them to do something. Okay. But if you ask them, hey, I noticed that you're getting ganked. My bad. I'm not doing my job because you don't see the gank coming. Do you want me to ward so you can keep on doing your stupid thing? Or do you want to go to a different part of the map? And then you know what they do 90% of the time? They go to the different part of the map. Yeah. It's crazy.
