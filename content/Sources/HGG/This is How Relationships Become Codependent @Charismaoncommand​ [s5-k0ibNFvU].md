 If you look at relationships, to a certain degree, we're responsible for our partner's feelings, right? Like, it's our job to help them feel better, and that's what especially romantic relationship is about. And at the same time, we can cross the realm into toxicity so quickly if we become solely responsible. And the other tricky thing that I oftentimes see in these kind of codependent relationships is that as you start taking more of that space, your partner starts taking less. And then eventually the burden of their feelings falls to you, and you feel wholly responsible for their feelings. And then, you know, you don't have 100% power, and then that leads to a whole host of challenges in terms of you trying harder, being more controlling, you know, as well as them sort of dumping the responsibility on you. And both of y'all agree that if they feel a particular way, it's your fault, which is really when relationships become very difficult.
