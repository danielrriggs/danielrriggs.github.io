 And so I'm gonna teach y'all a really simple way to talk to people so that you can join people. It's really simple. So you can walk up to people like, let's say you're at a conference or a party, you can say, hi. So look at them, make eye contact, smile. Okay, so you wanna go like this. Actually, you don't wanna go like that's weird if you're like, look, here I am. Don't do that. Don't do hand motions, okay? Just look at them and then smile. Like, so nod and make eye contact so that they know you're coming over. This dodges the problem that a lot of people who struggle with social activity struggle with, which is like, how do you insert yourself into the conversation? You walk up to a crowd of people, they're just standing there. And then you're like, just standing there awkwardly, you're not participating in anything. You're not like saying anything, you can't get a word in. So like, how do you avoid that? You make eye contact with someone in the group and you smile at them, you nod or something like that. And then you walk over. Because a lot of times we wonder, okay, what's my excuse for like entering into a group of people? I need some kind of reason. Do I need to explain to them that I have no friends and I'm socially awkward? No, you can just say, hi, my name is Oli. I'm looking to learn more about whatever this is. And then you shake hands with everybody. Now you're a part of the conversation, okay?
