 I think the other thing about making friendships last is that there's this idea that friendships need to be sustained over long periods of time. We kind of think about friendships as plants that you need to water every day to kind of maintain them. But I think a lot of male friendships aren't like regular plants. They're a little bit more like succulents or cacti that can go for years without getting a single drop of water. I know in my male relationships, I actually don't have to talk to people for five or We don't seem to lose any ground as friends. So I think if you're trying to cultivate the right kind of relationships with men, we have to change our framing a little bit about what it means to cultivate a relationship. The male friendship is one that requires very little effort to maintain, very little maintenance over time, and very little effort to get started. And I think that's just what male friendships are like, and that's okay.
