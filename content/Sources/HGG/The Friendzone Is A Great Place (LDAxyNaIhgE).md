 So this is what people don't understand about the friend zone. Friend zone is a great place to meet women if we're talking about a dude and a girl, or vice versa, right? Or friend zone for people who are gay, totally works. Just ask people to introduce you to other people, right? And that signals to your friend that you're not interested in them, you've moved on. Hopefully they don't get butt-hurt about it, but sometimes they will, and then they'll start playing games with you because they actually are attracted to you. And now you know. It's a win-win. That feels manipulatory, I can imagine. The purpose is not to... So here's the thing. Manipulation is about shaping someone else's behavior. So we're not doing this to shape their behavior. This is... I have a big problem with people who are manipulative. We're not doing this to be manipulative. We're not trying to get them. We're not trying to make them jealous. All I'm saying is that you shouldn't be stupid about this may excite some jealousy. If there was some degree of attraction, it may float to the surface, which is fine, right? And then you, as friends, you will talk through it. It's not to try to get her to like you. In fact, that's the wrong thinking. That's not being chill about it. That's being overly attached. That's unhealthy for you and unhealthy for them.
