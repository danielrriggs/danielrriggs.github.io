 How do we regulate our emotions? We regulate our emotions with our frontal lobes. Our frontal lobes, when we're feeling too emotional, our frontal lobes will be like, yo, amygdala, calm down, bro. It's okay. We'll be fine. Don't worry about it. Just relax. When our frontal lobes are capable of doing that, that's when we sort of feel emotionally better. So what leads to what sort of short circuits are frontal lobes? A lack of rest. As we get fatigued throughout the day, as fatigue builds up, at the end of the night, like we get pissed, we start making really stupid decisions. We make impulsive decisions. You don't text your ex who's toxic for you at like 11 a.m. on a Sunday when you're well rested and you played frisbee golf all morning. You text your toxic ex at two in the morning when your frontal lobes stop working and you can't control your emotions. That's when you stalk them on social media as well. So this is why first thing we got to do is we got to sleep more, strengthen our frontal lobes, and do so in a non-pharmacologic means if you can.
