 In those moments of discomfort, our natural inclination is to like retreat from them, right? Because we don't like being uncomfortable. How do you manage those moments of discomfort? When I feel uncomfortable, I used to just be like, ah, shut it down. I'm going to turn this other way. And instead, is I tell myself that I'm uncomfortable. I try to feel it in my body, become okay with feeling uncomfortable, because that just happens. I think about what I want and what I want at the end of this. So like if my friend and I are having a disagreement, and it makes me uncomfortable, I let it happen. I feel it and I say like, do I want to continue a friendship with this person? If the answer is yes, it's how do I do that? And chances are that person is also feeling uncomfortable too. And if two people are uncomfortable, you're both going to run away. But if one of you can fight for the friendship, shows the other person how much you care about them, if you can work through it, it really builds something. And that's also how you get these unbreakable friendships.
