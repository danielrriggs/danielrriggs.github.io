 So at the beginning, we seek particular things and we get some amount of happiness for some amount of time, but it's never enough, right? We see this a lot with the content creators that we work with have a hundred thousand subscribers. Oh my god. Go you yeah Are you happy now? No, I need two hundred thousand. Are you happy with two hundred thousand? No, this person they just came on the scene and they've been streaming for six months I've been streaming for two years and they have a hundred and eighty thousand and I have two hundred thousand I even have more than them, but I'm still unhappy So this is the problem with fulfilling desires in chasing your wants is that it's never enough It is the nature of a want to be temporary and the satisfaction of a want to be temporary How long does the happiness from the perfect wedding last? We have all these brides zillas and groom zillas now, right? I want this I want this I want this And even though you ruin all your relationships and you go into debt to get your perfect wedding What happens a month later six months later? So wants are temporary
