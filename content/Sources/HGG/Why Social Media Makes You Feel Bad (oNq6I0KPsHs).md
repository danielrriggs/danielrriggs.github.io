 The more time you spend on social media, the more negatively it impacts your mood. Everyone knows that we have good days and bad days. But what do I see when I log on to social media? What I see is one person had a birthday party today, look at how many people are having fun. And the next day I see another birthday party where everyone is having fun. And the next day I see another birthday party where everyone is having fun. Now each person only gets one birthday a year, but every time I log on to social media, what rises to the top is what is liked the most, where people are having the most fun. Does that kind of make sense? So every time I log on, what I'm seeing is the best moment of 365 lives. And then what it gives me the impression of is everyone is out there having fun all of the time. And I only get one birthday a year, but everyone else is having so much fun all the time. So it creates this false sense that everyone out there is living this perfect life. Whereas my life is just ordinary. And in the face of a perfect life, ordinary lives feel depressing.
