 If I ask you what masculinity is, where did that answer come from? For most people out there, their impressions of what it means to be a man is stuff that they've been spoon-fed over the course of their life. You've not actually decided this. You've not decided what kind of man you want to be. Everyone has told you what kind of man to be. This is your idea of masculinity. And even the objective definition, if you look it up in a dictionary or Wikipedia, masculinity will be defined as society's expectations of what a man is. Society is not a thing. It's an abstraction. That we take this abstraction from the outside world and then we put it into ourselves and we try to live up to society's expectations. Impossible. Because society's not even a real person. So masculinity, we've internalized it for sure. But what I'm saying is that even to function in society, we need some kind of ego. So what I'm encouraging that y'all do is develop a healthy sense of masculinity. You decide what you want to be in life. And we're just attaching the label of it, of masculinity, because it's easier for us to relate to.
