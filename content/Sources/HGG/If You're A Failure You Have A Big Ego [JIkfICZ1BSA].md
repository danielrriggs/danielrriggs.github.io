 From a yogic perspective, someone who believes that they are a failure has a big ego. And you may say, well, hold on a second. What is that? Like, I thought people who are failures have small egos. No, their sense of self is very strong. I am a failure. And that's a defining part of who they are. So their ego is actually quite large. It is the ego of failure or success or whatever. I am a doctor. I am a failure. It's still I am and then a very big thing. And then think about how that shapes their thoughts, their emotions, and their actions. When an opportunity arises, hey, I really think that you'd be a great fit for like this job. Or hey, I heard that so-and-so has a crush on you. You should really think about asking them out. And even if you're attracted to that person and you want that job, your ego will step in and it will say, they wouldn't take you. You'll screw it up anyway. They're not interested in dating you. So your sense of self defines the way that you interact with the world.
