 Is there a healthy way to engage with distraction? Absolutely. So I think this is where you say engage with a distraction. So that implies intentionality. So I would say the simplest thing about healthy or not healthy is who is choosing to do it. When the distraction controls you, when you can't choose to engage with it, like when it's engaging with you, then it becomes unhealthy. But distractions, like, you know, it's a really normal part of like healthy mental functioning. Like we all want breaks, we all need to be distracted. Yeah. I knew that I needed to wake up earlier than usual. And last night it was midnight. I was like, I'm going to play League of Legends. But it was a choice. It was a conscious choice. I knew that I would have a little bit less sleep, but I would be ready. And I thought of you. We won two in a row. If we had lost, this would be a far, I wouldn't have gotten any sleep. The challenge with games at midnight is that you can't quit on a loss and you can't stop with a win. Yes.
