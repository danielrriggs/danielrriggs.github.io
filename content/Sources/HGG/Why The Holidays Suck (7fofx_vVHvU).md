 It's like going for a jog and when you're you start huffing and puffing your lungs are like, oh shit we need to get in shape. That's literally what's going to happen in in their brain is they're like struggling to keep up with what you're saying. Okay so let's start with um so you don't want to go home for the holidays. So there there are kind of like three or four skills before we start off there are three or four skills that y'all need to learn that are going to be really important. The first is articulate instead of attack. Okay so the first thing to understand very important for the narcissistic family member is that you don't want to like as you state your opinion it will be perceived as oh what well maybe this will turn into a narcissistic family member. So first like so tip number one is articulate instead of attack. So if you don't like something about the holidays like for example you know let's say that like if your household is like mine you know most of the women are responsible for cooking and cleaning while the men sit around and basically do nothing. And so if you were to challenge that in some way and kind of point that out right then chances are like someone will feel attacked and like if they feel attacked they're going to get defensive and if they feel defensive and if they start to feel guilty then the narcissistic behaviors will pop up right because then they'll like attack you in turn because they're like how dare you make me feel you know lazy and you make me feel like called out you're calling me out for being lazy and not contributing to the holiday so screw you I'm on the attack. So the first thing that we need to do is learn how to articulate instead of attack okay. Second thing I know it's kind of rough don't expect much so understand that when it comes to traditions and dynamics around the holidays I apologize but one two hour stream is not going to give you the magic bullet that will allow you to become a superhuman go into the holidays and transform things overnight okay. It definitely is going to help you don't get me wrong but recognize that altering families and especially narcissistic personalities is not done after a two hour stream it's going to like take time. So what we're going to be doing is establishing a foundation of communication and boundary setting which you will then build on over time and then a year from now two years from now you'll start to see like real change within your whole family okay. Next thing is manage your own emotions so if you are trying to create change in any kind of situation you need to be calm cool and collected so like you can't get emotionally invested in what's going on because this is the Jedi mind trick when you get emotionally activated the narcissistic family member you're playing their game and they're going to win they're master manipulators right so the second you get emotional and the second they pull out responses from you that are like emotionally driven like you've lost because they're going to beat you at that game that's why they are what they are in the family right that's like how they get there is because they are they are diamond level players at emotional manipulation and so if they're emotionally manipulative and you're emotional you've lost that's the counter so what you need to do is like manage your own emotions because the more that you manage your emotions then they're not going to have like anything to attack right it's like you're going to have like you know you have like emotion vulnerability like that that's what they attack with so you just have to be you have to manage your own emotions so how do you do that we're going to teach a little bit of meditation today we're going to actually do it today so i'm going to share scenarios with you that are going to make you feel validated and then you'll process some of those emotions and hopefully you'll feel a little bit better off you can also do something like i think group coaching is fantastic for this kind of thing where you can join like one of our groups do some group coaching talk about the holidays bitch about the holidays commiserate with other people who are also bitching about the holidays process your emotions so that you can go into the the holidays calm cool and collected okay so these are our three skills articulate instead of attack don't expect much change is slow within families and manage your own emotions okay and that's not i'm not really debating you guys so you guys like we're talking about narcissism okay it's going to be the common thread here so we're going to take narcissism and we're going to run it through the other two and then we'll sort of conclude with it okay so you don't want to go home for the holiday so let's start with this scenario what does this look like i need a name chat what's the name okay nick okay so me perfect so hold on stop scroll okay okay so we've got peppalini okay so we're going to have peppalini so peppalini calls their parents and says dear parents of peppalini i'm sorry but i don't want to come home for the holidays and then the parents say what they say but honey we miss you so much little peppalini it's just without you or who's going to be our peppalini like we need our little peppalini it's such a wonderful time and we miss you so much and we love you so much and and like it's it's a time for the family to be together we miss you darling please come home you know we're just it's not the same without you it won't be the same you know they'll say all these kinds of things right and so like what are they actually saying they're talking about why the holidays are good for them we will miss you it's tradition it's something that we value it's all about their perspective and what they gain from the holidays and so this is what how you respond okay so this is like one on one you say okay so i'm hearing that if i don't come home from the holidays you'll miss me it won't be the same and you kind of like really value everyone being together for the holidays because that is important to you it'll hurt me beautifully put oh it'll hurt it'll hurt me therefore if you don't come home for the holidays you are damaging me you are hurting me by not coming right so if we really pay attention to that is there any understanding or anywhere in like is there room for peppalini in any of those statements are the parents even asking why don't you want to come home right is that even like happening at all no it's all about tradition and you're just a possession very well said right it's all about like how you will affect them it'll hurt you so this is where you reflect back and you can say oh dad i i get that you guys miss me a lot i get that like you know you really want me to be there and um i would hope i too enjoy being spending time with family up to a point you know i can definitely see the value so you want to acknowledge i can see the value in coming home for the holidays i'm curious and this is where you sucker punch him okay so get ready for this this is where you say what's your understanding of what my experience of the holidays is like so ask them don't tell them hey it sucks for me because a b c it sucks for me because all y'all ever ask me is when am i going to get married that's all you ever ask all you ever do is like talk about how you're so disappointed and how much potential i have and i've never lived up to it it you know like you don't you don't because if you do that what is that doing chat is that articulating or attacking it's attacking right so we're not going to do that we don't actually tell them you know like what we feel okay so don't attack chat i know you want to that's why you have to get your emotions in check okay no attacking i know you want to i really i know you do but we don't want to do it get your emotions in check don't attack so instead of saying all those things you're going to ask hey what's your understanding of like what it's like for me when i come home for the holidays and then the parents are going to be confused they're going to be like what because what you're asking them to do is you're like asking a question that requires them to use empathy you're asking them put yourself in my shoes you can say put yourself in my shoes but no one ever actually does that right that's not actually how you engage the empathic circuits of the brain what you actually do is you ask them a question what's your understanding of what my experience is like and then like they have to put themselves in your shoes to answer it and they'll say i don't know why don't you tell me and that's where you kind of take a step back and then you kind of once again articulate instead of acknowledge i mean instead of attack right and then you can say oh i can see now it's making a lot of sense that understanding my perspective is not something that like you it's not like you really understand what my experience is like and you need me to explain it to you i now understand why it's like been hard for me to come home for the holidays because i now get that like it seems like you don't actually understand what my experience is like and that's also why we have differing ideas of the holidays right because you seem to think it's like wonderful and fun and all these kinds of things but i get it now you actually don't understand what my experience is like and that's why you're confused why i don't want to come home for the holidays it makes sense to me and so that's like sort of an attack but what you really want to do is articulate that they don't understand what your perspective is like okay so it's kind of passive aggressive yeah because fuck them right this is really hard to execute you're damn right it is that's why we're training you line by line okay and we're going to give you guys a lot of training here i'm with you so you could say oh i i understand that you don't know what it's like for me and that makes sense to me like now i understand why we have differing opinions because you have this one understanding of the holidays and it seems like you're not really aware of mine okay so then they're going to feel attacked and they're like oh just tell us what are we doing wrong so this is this is pitfall number one where they tell you tell us what we're doing wrong and we will fix it they want to jump right to the solution okay because here's what's going to happen if they if they ask you okay so let's see chat let's see what your predictive what your you know predictive capabilities are if they say tell us what we're doing wrong and we'll fix it what happens if you tell them what they're doing wrong what are they going to say let's say that you guys always just ask me when am i going to get married and when am i going to live up to my potential what are they going to say if you say that oh beautiful that's correct oh so good so good two or three things okay so this is the problem the first is they'll start arguing with you they're like oh no like they'll deny they'll say like oh we don't do that like you're crazy bitch why are you thinking that that's not what we mean it's not what we mean don't you understand that's not what we mean we say it for your benefit it's because we love you we'll get denials we'll get justifications we'll get you're an idiot for not understanding right all of those things that's bucket number one it's a pretty big bucket it's not what we mean the next thing that they'll do or if you guys are like i don't know if that's lucky or unlucky the other thing is empty promises someone said it like that very good okay they'll be like oh we won't do that we'll do whatever you want little one oh peppalini please come back we promise we won't ask you about your marriage and here's the thing they can promise it in that moment but i want you all to understand this like their brain has not transformed in that moment that's not how behavioral change happens like in that moment they're not going to remember their promise it's not about remembering the promise it's about rewiring their brain it's about like because giving a promise does not teach them empathy do you guys get that what they need to do is have empathy for your situation but it's not like you just like make a promise and it's like your brain is like boom we're just going to build this empathy circuit up over here and it's going to be easy done finished right so they'll promise whatever they need to to get you to come and they'll say oh we promise we won't do that okay so either way peppalini don't trust them your parents are evil no your parents are not evil remember the goal of this is to develop healthy relationships with your family that's the goal of this okay but we have to understand what's going on in order to develop a healthy relationship with them so this is where remember you have to manage your expectations okay don't expect much and you can say so this is where like if they say whatever they say you can kind of articulate back so if they're very resistant you can just reflect back to them you're saying oh okay so like what you're saying is that you know my feelings and my reaction to your situation is to the holidays is like a misinterpretation of your intention so because you don't mean to hurt my feelings there's really nothing wrong with what y'all are doing am i hearing that correctly and they're going to be like wait a minute so this is the key thing right so if you don't argue you just articulate to them what they said just articulate it just be like hey so you're saying like basically you don't want to say like you don't want to get emotional because if you get emotional you're going to say something like you're basically telling me to go fuck myself right you don't want to say that but you want to say that you know just articulate so what i'm hearing is that the reason that i don't enjoy the holidays is because i don't understand what's going on with the holidays is because i don't understand your intention behind the words that you say is that fair to say just ask them is that what you mean or that are you saying that the reason i don't enjoy the holidays is because i'm confused about what y'all are saying because you never say so if they use denial if they use we love you even though i feel hurt you're set you're basically telling me that since it's coming from a place of love like you're going to continue doing it or so you can just ask them to play the tape through the end and this is where like once again there's going to be like an empathic lurch in their brain because if you're attacking them they can get defensive right but if you're like just asking them questions and like asking them to confirm the idiocy that comes out of their mouth they're going to get like kind of confused and then like you'll see there's like a calculation error it's going to be like the debugging process before you run the script like comes up with an error and it won't run properly and they'll kind of get confused and the good news is you're already winning at that point because their empathic brain is like struggling it's like going for a jog and when you're you start huffing and puffing your lungs you're like oh shit we need to get in shape that's literally what's going to happen in in their brain is they're like struggling to keep up with what you're saying because deep down they know that you're laying a trap for them right you're like they're like they can tell because you're not you're not folding they can tell that like oh my god there's a trap in here but they don't know how to dodge it because the trap is like literally their words and so they get like kind of confused they're like oh crap right you guys get that and so you can ask them to articulate and then this is where you can like pull like kind of a jujitsu move so like they make flounder and so this is where they'll also default to the second one they'll be like just tell us what you want just tell us how to fix it once they get confused and they don't know how to read you anymore they just be like just tell me what you want just tell me whatever you want i'll do it whatever whatever just tell me what do you what do you want from me have you guys heard that what do you want from me what do you want from me like what i want from you is understanding well how do i get explained to me how to understand tell me how to understand right it's confusing for them because you can't make them understand they have to make the effort to understand themselves and so you can say okay so this is where you've got an option if you're going to go home for the holidays you can lay a specific boundary and i'd start small so you can say yeah so what would help if you guys did not mention when i'm getting married or what my dating status is like what do you how do you all feel about and then ask them like so lay your boundary and then ask them how do you all feel about that can i come home for the holidays without talking about dating at all are you guys gonna do are you all willing to do that and then this is where they say oh of course we'll do it like we're totally fine with that and so then you'll kind of ask them okay so like let's just be clear so you guys are saying that you're not going to mention this and if it gets mentioned so this is this is the key part okay so you've got to prep them so here's the other thing okay so like here's a tip for narcissistic family members if you want to deal with like not just narcissism but just generally speaking family members you got to treat them kind of like kids in terms of like giving them warnings right so like when i'm dealing with my kids and it's like time to go in 15 minutes if i if it's time to go and i walk over i turn off the television or like i take away the ipad the kids throw a fit they're like ah but if i tell them hey in 15 minutes we're going to turn off the ipad and the kids like yeah okay whatever in 10 minutes we're going to turn off the ipad it's like yeah yeah whatever in five minutes we're going to turn off the ipad they're like yeah whatever and then when i actually take it away they still like throw a little bit of a hissy fit but they sort of get it because they saw it coming you got to give them a chance to see it coming you got to let them see the reaction coming so in terms of setting the limit about don't talk about marriage which you do as you say so just to be clear you guys are agreeing to not talk about this right and then the parents are like yes and so then this is you say okay so if it gets talked about y'all will understand why i'm not coming home for christmas so just let them know there's going to be a consequence to their behavior let them see it don't spring it on them after they screw up oh i'm sorry we didn't know no because then you get back to square one do y'all get that like if you spring the punishment on them after they screw up which they're gonna do then it's like they're gonna be mad at you again they're gonna be like oh give us another chance like give us another chance like oh we promise we won't do it this time like we just made a mistake like just not this this time like right so you gotta let them know so you're gonna say okay so just so we're all on the same page i'm gonna come home for the holidays you guys are not going to mention the marriage stuff and if you do you'll totally understand why i'm not coming home for christmas right so then like we don't need to have this discussion again let them know what's coming down the pipeline that's how you set a boundary right you say like hey here's the boundary i'm gonna play this game with you but if you cross it there are going to be consequences and you let them know what the boundary and the consequences are ahead of time does that is this is very important how to set boundaries 101 right it's not a threat it's not even it's just like this is law right it's not it's a law of physics if this gets talked about don't expect me for christmas and then when it gets talked about which inevitably will don't once again don't attack don't articulate i mean you want to articulate right so you can say hey i thought we agreed not to talk about this and if they like they're like oh yeah we're sorry and then don't say anything else right and then like you can decide afterward because now you've like now that you've like set them up like so now you've got a reason you can say hey i'm just gonna like take a pass on christmas you know just like tell them like you don't have to tell them there i wouldn't tell them right then i would wait till thanksgiving is over and see if they continue to respect the boundary if they do you can sort of be like hey i know y'all like i appreciate that you guys brought it up and i brought it up with you and then you guys like steered clear of it thank you very much um i know that like y'all care about me and stuff like that so that's totally fine uh you know if you guys if like if we can keep this up that actually made the experience a lot more enjoyable for me i'm happy to come home for christmas if we can keep this up and then if they did if they don't continue to respect your boundary then you could say yeah afterward you can be like hey i sort of had fun but you know i kind of like we discussed something and we weren't going to talk about like marriage and stuff like that and you guys kind of like didn't respect that so i'm not going to be coming home for christmas like we discussed just let them know ahead of time and just boom right does that make sense so um so just to kind of summarize a couple of things so the first thing is if you don't want to go home for the holidays ask them to articulate your perspective first ask them what do you think my experience is like that's going to be engaging their empathic circuitry getting them to like think a little bit about it right don't attack them whatever they come up with they may result in denial or like whatever or like just tell us whatever they'll like try to like fast forward the conversation at the end they're like i don't know how to play this game let's get to the game just tell me what i need to say and i'll say it and then just come home because i want you home to get my emotional needs met because i'm your parent and i love you right they're not coming from a bad place hopefully let's assume not so ask them to articulate your perspective whatever they do try to hypothesize repeat it back to them especially if they give you denial or like it's not our fault and things like that and so you can kind of like you can sort of make it not really an attack but you're just pointing out to them what they're saying so you're saying oh it's not my fault but i so since it's not your fault because it's driven by love what i'm hearing from you is that i can't really expect that to change at all right because you're never going to stop loving me which i appreciate and this is just how your love is going to manifest so i basically have a choice between like coming home and dealing with this or not coming home and then not dealing with it it seems like the choice that i have to make is like the two are tied together so if i don't want to hear that the only solution i've got is to like not come home for the holidays so lay it out for them whatever they tell you you're going to just jujitsu it there's an aikido up in here okay whatever they throw at you you're just going to throw right back at them in a non-emotional non-confrontational way hey let's just get on the same page about what are the rules of the game and as you pointed out to them they're going to panic they're going to start promising that's when you lay the boundary you figure out what's my boundary if your boundary is not respected you can give them feedback right then and there but that's usually comes across as emotional or you can give them feedback afterward that can be far healthier so once you've calmed down emotionally like the next day be like hey y'all asked me a couple questions about marriage i just wanted to understand is that something that y'all are going to continue to do because i was under the impression we talked about this and you know y'all had sort of agreed not to yeah but but we just care so much and we're so you're so we're so worried and you're so handsome and they're all these wonderful and we know that but and we know and we love you and but yeah right and so then you're going to articulate back and you can say okay fine i understand that it's going to be hard for you understood and then if you get up and leave if you like you broke you made a promise you broke that promise meh i'm leaving meh meh then what's gonna happen in their mind they're gonna think oh my god he's so he's hurting so much on the inside he needs love we don't have to respect him because he's acting emotionally and like a child you know he's like oh like so they're not gonna take you seriously if you act emotionally so you can say okay fine so you ride out the rest of the holidays heaven knows that you've written out so many so far and then after it ends that you just circle back and say hey like you know we talked about this i mentioned it to you again and y'all basically said that like because it's so important to you you're gonna bring it up and you're not really interested in like what my perspective is so if i don't come home for christmas now you understand why right so you can leave an if there if you want to you don't have to like punish them then and there you can just say like okay i now understand that anytime i come home like this conversation is going to be had and if i try to tell y'all to not talk about it i basically am going to get ignored which is fine so then i just have to make the decision about whether i want to like if i really don't want to have the conversation then i just won't come home which is totally cool they're like oh no no no no we didn't mean it we promise we'll change you'll be like okay i we had that conversation last time though easy so i'll just let me like stew on it and i'll let you know whether i'm coming home for christmas okay so if the boundary isn't respected you can give feedback either in the moment or later and the main thing is to let them see the consequence coming and like as long as you remain like set in yourself manage your own emotions don't expect too much lay a boundary let them see the consequence coming over time so when one person saying adults will never change i completely disagree so they will change and i've seen that time and time and time again the problem is that we are just not educated in how to get adults to change right we're not like we're just like operating like think about how do you approach family situations like how like where is the wiki on family situations where is the walkthrough on family situations where is the class on like how to deal with family situations where is the class on like how to manage your emotions right so like so i i don't blame you for believing that adults will never change because let's be honest the majority of times that's true and yet just because you know no human has ever flown doesn't mean that no human will ever fly it just requires the right kind of technology so what we're offering y'all is an interpersonal technology that if you learn how to use properly it is our hope that you will start to change the relationships in your life and it's not your fault you're not stupid or anything and it's kind of not their fault because they weren't taught either do y'all get that like they didn't like the reason they can't answer the question what is your understanding of my experience is because their empathic circuits haven't been developed right does that make sense so like we want to have compassion for them they're not i mean we're kind of memeing them a little bit but that by the way is to validate your emotions if you guys haven't figured that out right we don't actually think your parents are bad like we're the goal of this is to try to make things work okay as is eco go is saying they didn't know better absolutely all right so that's if you don't want to go home for the holidays okay what if they still feel attacked and get defensive we'll get to that in a second all right we'll get to that with the narcissism where do i buy this flying technology it's right here on stream for the low low price of zero dollars and zero cents all it costs is two hours of your time okay so the second thing is how to challenge tradition all right so i'm going to give you all a scenario and we'll sort of see like the narcissism coming out you guys see what i mean now like it's just that like i want to i want to like give you guys like good scenarios that we can see like the defenses and stuff start to come out okay so how to challenge tradition so this is the tradition that i'm going to use all right so like i don't know about y'all but in my family generally speaking for the holidays the women will cook and clean which is like quite a endeavor okay so it involves like grocery shopping a day or two before the preparation of cooking and the marinating of things and whatever like the day before and then like you know you start cooking it like like 8 a.m in the morning and it's like a marathon thing because we're going to like do a wonderful meal and then the men in my family tend to just hang out right so oftentimes there is football involved or cricket or whatever but there's just this very like simple like dynamic of like the women cooking clean and like the men just kind of sit around and and i don't want to get into i'm not trying to make this about like gender the patriarchy or like women being oppressed or things like that like or things like that like it's not my place to kind of pass judgment on that i mean i'm gonna i'm gonna sort of pass judgment but not from like a political way it's just like that's not really like fair so i think that some of this stuff if we kind of think about the origins you know i think this sort of made sense when like gender roles were a little bit more clear right so they're like maybe 50 60 70 80 years ago 100 years ago men had a pretty particular like role which is that they left the house and they like hunted or chopped wood or worked and then women would sort of take care of the home right this is like the traditional like hundred year old sort of gender role divide and even that at that point i don't i don't know if women did more you know less work than women i'm sure that someone out there more educated than i am will be able to give me an answer to that but i think at that point it was about a division of labor where like men worked and women hand manage the household and so i think that even in a sense like that tradition was probably understandable or came from somewhere because it evolved right so it like evolved for a reason and chances are that like the reason that it evolved that way was because of that division of labor so like if you know if if the man was planning like a work event i would imagine that they would do the heavy lifting for that but maybe not i don't want to get this into gender dynamics but i do want to sort of acknowledge that there are traditions which may be unhealthy or unfair to some people this is the one that i'm going to use because it's the one that i understand the best it's the one that i grew up with and it's the one that i think a lot of people can relate to so that sort of used to work because like women didn't used to have jobs right but now like women have jobs so the division of financial labor tends to be like more even than it used to be but our traditions right because their traditions seem to be lagging behind so if you are like in my household you would see what i saw which is that you know my dad was a doctor and he worked more than my mom and my mom was a doctor so they were both practicing physicians my dad probably worked on average five hours more per day than my mom did maybe even more because he would oftentimes like work saturdays as well so he may have worked like 30 hours more per week than my mom even though they were both practicing physicians but what i sort of noticed is that like on balance my mom did more than 30 hours of like housework per week and that includes like picking us up and dropping us off and going grocery shopping and like all that kind of stuff so you know if you're in this kind of situation how do you challenge this sort of like dynamic so this is where once again if you criticize it which may be fair so like if you get like emotional about it and you criticize it you're like the patriarchy and like women are oppressed like you can say that and i think you've got a valid argument but i don't think you're going to win any points in a family situation like i don't think that people are going to walk away from that and be like you know oh you're right like this should change i think what's going to happen if you start like criticizing them is they're going to feel attacked when they feel attacked they they get defensive and when they get defensive they're going to call you a bitch right they're going to that's what's going to happen so i'm not saying that that's even that is fair i'm not saying that your criticisms aren't legit but what i'm saying is like it's easier to catch more flies than honey than it is with vinegar like that's my style right and that's what happens so if you've got a traditional family structure like that's how you're going to be received and be judged so here's the first thing so if you're a dude and there is an unhealthy tradition you should like do what you think is right so act in accordance to your dharma so like when i so this is something that i do now right which i'm sure that once again i'll give you guys an example but so like i try to help out during holidays because i remember so what would happen in my household is like we would have a big holiday and my brother was older and i was younger and so therefore for some reason i fell into the women's camp and so my brother got to chill but i got to like i had to like cook and clean all day and i was like what the f is this like why like so somehow like subconsciously my mom like put me in the role of a daughter because she didn't have a daughter she needs someone so like i guess it's the younger kid is the daughter so i had to like cook and clean all it was like this is bs like f this right my brother helped out too and stuff like that but you know it just felt really unfair to me so now so if you're a dude and there's an unhealthy tradition here's how you challenge it so if you're the man in this situation i would go and help out in the kitchen and this is going to create all kinds of problems right so then like what's going to happen is like you're going to start helping out and then like the other men in your family are going to be like oh like stop doing that ha ha ha that's women's work lol and we mean that as a joke it's clearly not women's work because we know that gender equality and all that but ha ha ha ha ha right so if you start helping out like what's going to happen like even if you don't say anything here's the thing you don't need to say anything you don't need to be like this is unfair this is a relic of the patriarchy and down with whatever blah then they're going to just write you off as like some crazy political person right instead just let your actions do the talking you're not going to criticize anyone you're not going to say that anything that they're doing is wrong right you just act in accordance with your dharma so you go and you help out you go to the women you say hey what can i do you want me to pick up this you want me to do this you want me to do this you want me to do this at some point someone's going to excite comment on it right and this is when once again you want to articulate you don't want to attack but you're going to attack people are going to feel attacked you're not going to expect much from them you're going to manage your own emotions and if if you are like me this will happen well someone will start making fun of you and they'll be like what do you like are you doing women's work and so my response would be you know thanksgiving is about gratitude and like i really appreciate all the work that they're doing so this is the way that i show my gratitude and then you just walk away continue helping in the kitchen and then people are going to be like well fuck right like how do they argue against that so this is where like if you guys want to like don't tell people that they're doing bad things just articulate instead of attack hey all y'all fuckers should not be sitting on the couch this is unfair don't do that right you just act in accordance with your dharma you articulate why you're doing it and then even if they continue making fun with you like because they they don't know what to like people don't know how to respond to that right like because people don't say shit like that which is exactly why you guys need to learn how to say it so like you just say like this is the way that i show my gratitude you're not saying hey and they're like what you don't so this is what's going to happen like they're going to feel attacked right so they're going to come at you and they're going to be like look what you don't think we're grateful and you're like hey i never said that i'm sure you show your gratitude in whatever way is appropriate to you this is just how i show mine i'm not judging you you do you bro right so like roll with that resistance don't attack don't articulate say i never said that now if you want to go on the attack you can be like how do you show your gratitude bitch you're ungrateful oh i raised you and you're like cool i'm grateful for that so they attack you and they're like oh i raised you like i can't believe you're so ungrateful and you're like bro that's why i'm not sitting on on the couch and fucking watching football and i'm cooking you a pie it's my way of showing gratitude what are you getting mad at me for right so like you stay aligned with your dharma and you just like throw it back at them and you're like if you think up look why the fuck am i making a pie for you it's like you're not going to be happy with your dharma and you're like why the fuck am i making a pie for you it's because i'm grateful and then like they can't they'll you they it's you're gonna you're gonna k.o. it's a k.o. that's like the advantage of living in accordance with your dharma you guys get that okay excellent question what to do if you were a woman moving on so if you were a woman get people to articulate right let them lay the trap themselves so you talk to ideally another woman or man like so you talk to your parents let's say let's say you're the daughter of the family so you talk to your parents and say hey i'm thinking about coming home for thanksgiving help me understand what i should expect get them to say it what's gonna happen like what should i expect we're trying to plan and then your mom will be like well we're gonna start cooking like on wednesday morning and we'll serve dinner on thursday afternoon and so then so like just like so i'm coming with my husband let's say and so so what is he going to be doing for 24 or 36 hours just get him to articulate it they're gonna be like he's gonna be hanging out with with your dad okay like what am i going to be doing you're going to be in the kitchen fucking cooking and cleaning and so then you can articulate it to them so you can say okay so just so i understand this mom and i are going to be cooking and cleaning for about 36 hours and then my husband is going to be like just kind of hanging out and they're going to be relaxing and so then this is where like your parents are going to be like this is where the defenses come out y'all ready it's tradition oh beta it's tradition it's okay it's tradition now sometimes like if you if you end up doing well like like i've seen this happen before where like the dad is sort of like oh wow like that's actually insane so if you just like talk to people without sort of attacking them sometimes they'll realize they'll be like yeah that's kind of fucked and so you know maybe like i've seen this before where dads will be like we'll just order out because it's not really fair for y'all to be cooking and cleaning and then what will happen we'll get to this i don't know if we're gonna get to this today but then there's an enabler this is the flip side to the narcissistic family member and this is why we got to go through the scenarios first there's the enabler where dad's like we can just order out and who's going to screw you in that situation huh who's going to screw you you're making so much progress things are even mom mom is going to screw you oh no honey we don't have to do that it's our way of showing love right because then there's all kinds of things that happens in mom's mind and this isn't her fault because she's been culturally conditioned that on thanksgiving you don't order out like what the right like that's the antithesis of thanksgiving thanksgiving is about showing your gratitude and love by laboring away in the kitchen like what kind of reject grandma or mom like orders pizza for thanksgiving like that's a failure like we've been societally conditioned to think that women will be failures if they don't cook for thanksgiving y'all get that and so mom's gonna sandbag you she's gonna torpedo because she's gonna feel bad so this is where if you really want to this is really getting to the next level but you gotta like deal with that guilt right so mom's feeling guilty she's feeling like she's letting you down and so you gotta be like okay so mom if you really want to do that i know it's kind of weird but this way you've got a couple of different plays but one is you can just accede to that and say like you know okay if you really want to cook like we can do that if that's really important to you and that's where like once again you're acting in accordance with your dharma because you're you're sort of like you're taking one for the team right you're doing it to help your mom feel better but you know that dad's on your side and so maybe then you have a second conversation with your husband or your dad and say like hey like you know mom is like the one who's like sacrificing all this time for our benefit so like we should all help out or let's do something nice for her so that's another thing that you can do like you can like go out of your way to really make them feel appreciated right so you can do things that lets mom sort of be a good woman in her mind because that's the way that she's been conditioned or even it's not conditioning that's sort of like actually kind of condescending she may actually value that right like that may be like what she views as her dharma this is something that i want to do for my family so it's actually quite condescending for us to assume that she's conditioned oh she can't think on her own she is a woman she has been conditioned by the patriarchal society like that's actually really fucking condescending now that i think about it right so maybe that's just how she does her dharma and so it's just about sort of having that conversation and you know like you you can sort of see where like where that conversation goes so maybe it is ordering out maybe it is like you know having a conversation then with your husband or dad about hey we're going to chip in and we're all going to help or we're going to do something super awesome for mom like we're going to do something for mom that like repays the karmic debt that she is doing for us okay and if you're a spouse so this is the third scenario we're going to talk about this one is arguably the most challenging because you have a lot of power in the other two the third the third one this is the hardest is if your in-laws have an unhealthy tradition and you're the spouse of someone else so this is like if you're the wife your husband's family has all these like traditions that you think are unhealthy or unfair and you are like you know it's like one v five kind of situation because like your your spouse has grown up with these traditions so they think it's normal like the in-laws are doing it like you have to maintain some kind of like you know relationship with your in-laws so you don't want to be like one of these like spouses who's like a bitch to deal with you know and i don't mean that from a gender standpoint i mean just like just a general word and so like that's where you have to have a conversation with your your spouse about hey like what do you think about these traditions right get them to articulate like what am i what are you signing me up for when we go to your parents house for thanksgiving like what are you signing me up for and what are you signing yourself up for also you can attack a little bit when it comes to your spouse because they're your spouse and it's like you know no holds and or holds bar you know so it's like it's your spouse so go for it so just have a have a conversation and you know like like just kind of get people to articulate it so um that that's kind of okay i'm assuming that that you can uh you can have a conversation with your spouse okay so questions about challenging traditions okay let's move on to narcissistic family members all right okay so i use the term narcissistic but that's not really that's not really fair but so what we're going to talk about now is like family members who are like emotionally manipulative and we're going to lay out their move set okay so like we're going to like put ourselves like imagine you're like trying to fight a boss in dark souls and like you have to understand what their move set is in order to like see their different attacks and like how to dodge it so we're almost going to like give you a like a a boss fighting guide for like the narcissistic family member so they've got a couple of good moves so you got to be careful okay the first is that they're emotionally manipulative so the way that they get their needs met is through provoking particular reactions out of other people so that's move number one move number two is they make you responsible for their behavior they do this weird like mind meld psychic thing psychic thing where they make you responsible for their behavior so a good example of this is like let's say that um let's say that you make a dish for thanksgiving and your cousin makes a dish for thanksgiving and you make a dish that's better than your cousin's and your cousin notices that and they feel hurt and so then your cousin is like okay fine if no one wants to eat my dish I'll just eat it all because I don't want it to go to waste and they're like sacrificing themselves by eating this crappy dish that they've made and they like they like go and they buy across from the grocery store and then they start lugging it around okay you guys get what I'm saying there that they like they make you responsible for their actions and then everyone feels bad right so they like and then like suddenly their choice to eat crappy food is like somehow your fault it's like no they don't have to eat their crappy food they can eat the good food that you made but they're somehow like making you responsible for their stupid choice right and so that it's martyrdom so they like look they like go find this cross somewhere and they start lugging it around so other examples of this are people who will like will go on like hunger strikes right so you see this a lot like this is like acting out kind of behaviors where you know like if you say something like if you point out let's say let's use our earlier example of unhealthy traditions that you challenge right and then like your dad gets offended because you point out that he doesn't do anything whereas your mom works a lot and then he gets hurt so then what he does is like you know what if you don't feel like I'm like doing it I don't have to eat any of the food I'll just get McDonald's you guys can cook whatever and I won't touch it because I'm not helping making it right so you don't want me to eat it right because you think that's unfair and I'm taking advantage of your mother I'm just going to order takeout then you guys can have this luxurious meal and I'll make myself a sandwich I'll eat a bowl of cereal right like you guys know what I mean so they like they somehow like they make you responsible for their stupid behavior so in the most extreme situations usually this doesn't happen at Thanksgiving but another example of this is if you don't break if you break up with me if you leave me I'm gonna kill myself and it's gonna be your fault I'm gonna commit suicide if you ever leave me right so it's like you making like it's very emotionally manipulative so it's holding you responsible for their behavior now why does this work so much in family situations it's because in family situations there's going to be one weak link okay so in the in an individual relationship like let's say you're in a controlling relationship where someone is holding you emotionally hostage and they say if you break up with me I'm going to kill myself all you really have to do I'm not saying that that situation is easy but all you really have to do is like you have to make the decision to hold the boundary you just have to break up with them and then you're out right you just have to get one person to hold the line it's one v one the problem with families is that you have to get a bunch of people to hold the line so if like if your dad is like oh I'm just gonna eat a sandwich that's fine I won't touch the turkey I won't touch the pie I won't touch the stuffing I won't touch the salad then what's gonna happen is if you're okay with that you're like okay so like I made it it's there for you to eat so that's the right move right so we'll get to that in a second you say like it's right here I made enough for you if you don't want it we can throw it away at the end of the night it's your choice right just give it right back to them like be like okay like look dad whatever you want to do if you feel more comfortable eating like a bowl of cereal when we made this food that's totally fine we can pack it up for leftovers donate donate to the homeless or we can throw it away like whatever you prefer right so you like empower them so this is the the counter move to them making you responsible for their behavior you push it back you say no no no I'm not responsible for your behavior you're responsible for your behavior you push that responsibility back over there say whatever you want dad whatever makes you happy if that makes you more comfortable remember do your dharma well you're like dad I'm here to make you happy so I've made this for you because you know it's available but if you don't feel comfortable eating it or you feel it's unfair like I'm okay with that too I'll make sure it doesn't go to waste and then what is he supposed to say like but that's hard to do as one person because someone there is gonna do what chat you say that and then what does mom say what does brother say what do they say huh yeah don't do oh don't do that no no no no honey like no please eat the food please please eat the food please please we made it with so much love please oh I know that you're acting like a little bitch but if I'm extra nice to you and I turn into a doormat would that make you feel better does your ego need some stroking do you need do you need us to know how much we love you and how much we care about you did little baby have a boo boo for his ego oh not poor with a baby don't eat the sandwich with the baby oh not with the baby I love you so much with the baby please eat the food please don't make me don't hurt mama oh right that's what happens no boundary setting one person caves this is a problem with families one person's gonna cave and this is why the narcissistic person gets to where they are because this behavior gets tolerated over time right because like someone is gonna cave because then what they'll start to do if you're not careful is they'll start to escalate you know like they're like okay I'm gonna eat cereal and then y'all are like okay bro you do you and then like hey that didn't work because then they're like I'm not hungry I'm not gonna eat at all and they're like and then like oh my god so what they do is they like they like they're trying to break the line right and they're gonna start escalating and they start to get really upset and then if no one's like oh no no no please eat please eat please eat if no one does that then they're like they're not gonna say screw you because they know they're in the wrong that's what's so hard about this is like this is a grave that they've dug for themselves and they're jumping into it and they're like whining when no one is letting them like helping them out even though like they can climb out on their own it's like a one-foot grave and they're staying like you just stand up and step out it's like one step but they're like no right and so they can try to escalate and you have to be careful because generally speaking like the family will crack at some point and so this is also where you see the enablers mantra okay so if you want to understand who is enabling within your family it is this phrase that's just how they are that's just how they are you know uncle billy he just likes fondling little boys that's just how he is you know boys will be boys that's just little that that's just how they are so that is the the response of an enabler right seriously that's just how you know how dad is you know he's not gonna eat unless we do this and it's like think about that statement for a second you are now responsible for their eating like how the hell does that work like unless you do particular things like your dad isn't gonna eat like your dad isn't gonna eat like what the hell you guys get that that's absurd but like when you have an emotionally manipulative person in the family that's what they do they like train other people to be responsible for their crappy behavior right and so then it's like it's sort of like well if i'm not gonna eat it's your fault if you were nicer to me if you hadn't brought up all this stuff and made me feel bad then you wouldn't have to deal with this but now you have to deal with this so what are you gonna do about it yeah yeah and i'm gonna escalate if you don't like make my emotional needs met like i'm gonna i'm gonna hurt you because you hurt me so this is the other thing that they do so this is the like now like we've done a couple of move sets how to counter them so now we have to understand like generally speaking what's going on with this boss so what's going on is that they have emotional needs that need to be met and unfortunately through conditioning or upbringing or whatever they have learned this is the way i get my emotional needs met okay so they feel like so now now this is where like we have to tie in the other two examples if something happens in the holidays that makes them feel hurt they're going to engage in behaviors that cause other people to shower them with love do you guys get that so like if i feel hurt i can't process that on my own so i'm gonna escalate and people are gonna be like oh poor baby oh little baby oh i'm so sorry and then i feel that love so this is why these people are so freaking frustrating to deal with because they artificially create situations that cause people to react and give them the emotional support that they need for an unrelated problem so they can't say hey i felt ashamed ashamed when my son started helping out in the kitchen and like it made me realize oh man like i've actually been kind of a shit dad for like 10 years because i never helped out at thanksgiving there's a lot of shame that comes up and comes with that and that's really hard for me to process because now i feel bad about myself the healthy thing to do is to like go to people and say like hey i feel like kind of ashamed that i haven't helped out right because if you say that like i never realized that like i should be helping out and like now i kind of feel like a dumbass if you go to your family and you say that like what is your family going to do they're going to be like no it's totally fine and then like those like one or two things will happen so you got to watch out because there's an enabler move and then there's like a disabler move the enabler move is don't worry about it honey it's okay you don't have to feel that way go sit down on the couch that's the enabler move the disabler move is cool let can you help us out because then it's like you don't have to feel that way anymore and you fix the behaviors you got to be very careful because that's sort of like that's sort of like the the end of the boss fight where you have to hit one button and if you if you hit the button right the boss is defeated but if you miss that window they get like 30 of their health back and they're like back to square one you got to watch out right so that's that that's in the wiki at the bottom it's like the final phase of the boss fight you have to do this mechanic which if you don't know about it's going to wipe your rain okay so you got to got to be careful about that but that's what you should do you should just like articulate your feelings about this problem but like some people who are emotionally manipulative it's not their fault really because the reason they learn to do this is because people did this shit with them right like your grandparents are like very manipulative and that's how they learned it that's how they learned how to get their emotional needs met and so this is where the picking up your cross comes from because if they feel hurt and they want to feel love they'll create these other artificial situations which drive people insane like it drives the family like absolutely insane because everyone knows subconsciously that this has nothing to do with like you know the parent like oh like you didn't get your tires rotated i asked you to get your tires rotated i can't believe you didn't get your tires rotated it's so disrespectful don't you understand that your mom and i could die in that car if you didn't get your tires rotated they just like unload on the sun because the sun is like helping out in the kitchen it's like what the hell where is this coming from and so it's very confusing for people but like once a narcissistic person feels hurt they're going to do one or two things they're going to lash out at you or they're going to guilt you into loving them you guys got that does that make sense so that's the narcissistic person so just to kind of summarize they're emotionally manipulative they like to play the martyr they make you responsible for their bad behavior and the reason that they do so well in families is because it's not just one person that they have to manipulate they just have to find one chink in the armor right because here's the other thing like you guys want to know like how good this is like how good they are at this so let's say like let's go back to the hunger strike right oh like if you don't if i didn't help out in the kitchen i won't eat the food and then there's like i'm just i'll make myself a sandwich and then everyone's sitting at the table they're sitting there defiant and completely neutral not participating in a conversation with their baloney sandwich and everyone else is eating like turkey and pie and stuff like that people like hey do you want some pie and they're like no i didn't help make it so i don't get to eat it right they even give you some of that attitude no no i don't deserve to eat that i didn't help make it and then what happens is one person cracks they don't do it right there publicly but after dinner everyone goes to whatever and then mom shows up and they're like honey please make this pie i ate it with love and then the parent eats it right he eats the pie and then it's dad and mom in the kitchen eating pie by themselves whereas everyone else is laughing and having fun out there and that's when you're screwed the worst because then one person is there and then like the parent is like oh at least one person understands me at least one person cares everyone else is so callous everyone else is so oh my god they're so callous i can't believe at least i've got one person in this family who cares about me and how did this whole thing fucking start it started because other people were helping in the kitchen and you weren't and somehow you end up feeling like the rest of the family is callous and then what happens is the rest of the family realizes mom snuck dad a piece of pie and then everyone in the living room feels like shit they're like you know at the end of the day like how petty am i being that like i couldn't just encourage the dude to eat a piece of pie like how heartless am i that like dad is just dad and like i should have just gotten him to eat a piece of pie right you guys get that like that that final thing is like that's when you get ko'd wiped and back to the bonfire boys and girls time to time to respawn because it's like i can't believe they're so callous and then everyone out there feels like an asshole because one person has shown compassion right and then everyone else is like well fuck we should have shown compassion too and then next thanksgiving what happens next thanksgiving the boss is stronger and your equipment is busted because you lost that move like you know it's like it carries over and so like then no one throws down with dad after that right it's not oh god it's gonna happen again and then it happens again and again and that's when you end up with that's just how he is you know your dad that's just how he is how do you guys think people get that impression of a person because it happens over and over and over again so just to summarize if you're dealing with a narcissistic parent or family member recognize that at the at the core of it they want to be loved and if you do anything that is perceived as an attack or they feel hurt they will they will activate right it's like one of these bosses that's asleep and how do you start the boss fight you walk over you're like charge slash and crit it in the face and then it like wakes up and it's like ah and then once it activates by being like attacked in some way and it's not even that you're attacking it it's just like hey this is my way of showing gratitude i'm gonna help out in the kitchen even though i'm a dude it's my way of showing gratitude they're like ah that's like a critical hit to the face for a narcissist you guys get that they're like oh my god like i've lost 20% of my health like i'm gonna enrage now i'm gonna show you who's boss hunger strike go hunger strike move the silent treatment emotionally manipulative all of these like modes start activating and they look for chinks in the armor they're gonna find one person they make you feel responsible for their behavior and then suddenly whether oh my god can you think about how my god can you think about how sad this is your dad did not eat a single bite for thanksgiving and it's just because you were so egotistical i can't believe you how dare you he didn't even a single bite i can't believe you're like this you know how he is is how dare you ruin thanksgiving absolutely right oh my god you with your social justice like patriarchal oh my god and your dad didn't even a bite eat a bite for thanksgiving so that's how they work so how to deal with the narcissistic parent in short okay i feel like we should this is probably enough for today but we'll think about the enabler and strategies to defeat the narcissistic parent the first thing is to recognize what's going on okay you just have to understand these dynamics the other thing is that the key to dealing with a narcissist is if you can meet the emotional needs then everything comes tumbling down so all of the problems they create all of the acting out they do all of the victimhood and stuff like that is because they're hurting all they're looking for is love so all you have to do is give them love and you can do it with a boundary right you can say like like i know it's kind of weird but you just have to like be nice to them basically but don't play their game because you don't want to reinforce their behavior you want to give them compassion outside of that thing and so even if you're like playing with your dad and like you guys do board games and they've thrown this hissy fit i know it's kind of weird but like even three hours before the meal if you're like i'm i want to be on dad's team you know like it's gonna be like it's gonna be like dad and daughter versus like mom and son let's go good job dad like you did awesome man this is really fantastic i like what you've done with the place just like show them that you love them and then like if they feel love then they're kind of confused because they're like they're feeling love and they no longer need to pick up the cross the other thing that you can do is like i know it's kind of weird but if you have a narcissist ask them for help that's the second thing that you can do because when you ask someone for help you like elevate them into the role of like a helper who's powerful right and if they're powerful like they don't like it's hard to play the victim so if you're the son in that situation i'd go over dad and i'd say hey like how did you feel about that conversation and he's gonna be like oh it was totally fine like you know like i don't have to eat the food and you can be like dad i think it would be really awesome if like we could all do this together as a family will you please come and like at least help out a little bit just ask them for help and then like disarms the whole damn thing they're not going to say like no because what does that make him that makes them the asshole you guys get their whole entire thing is to make you the asshole and then the victim but if you create a situation where you allow them to be the hero instead of the asshole they're going to take it in a heartbeat you guys got that so ask them for help and give them like compassion and that's how you do it it's hard but it's actually not you know someone's asking isn't this just manipulation though i don't know i'd call it education right because i think this is the key thing like manipulation i think is about an unhealthy end what's the goal of all of this information it's to create harmony during the holidays right and once we once we find a narcissistic family member like what's my answer about what you should do is treat them with love and then ask for their help like you could call that manipulation i guess it's just playing the game on their level let's call it that right but do it like like act in accordance with your dharma that's why like these techniques you know a blade a sword isn't either good nor evil it's what you use it for right so like i know it's kind of weird but one of my supervisors once realized that i was like very good at this kind of stuff and so she in her final feedback for me she was like you did a great job working with me these past three months i've won one piece of feedback for you or one thing that you should do going forward and i said what is that she's like use your power for good instead of evil that was literally the feedback that i got from like a 55 year old 50 year old psychiatrist she was like use your power for good not evil i was like all right i will do that if you tell me to fine right and so i think it's just a technique the question is what are you using it for i'm not suggesting that you use these techniques to start a crypto coin and manipulate people into investing i'm not suggesting you use these techniques to create a monetization structure for a video game i'm suggesting that you use these techniques to create more harmony and peace within your family structure over the holidays so that you can survive your holidays if you need to you can set healthy boundaries with your parents so that you retain your own sanity and you educate them and like help them understand like how to be a functioning family unit right that's why we're doing it but do you call it manipulation yes and i think the other big problem about that term if we think about it is this goes back to like why we're not taught this stuff in the first place the fact that like interpersonal skills gets labeled as manipulation is like absolutely insane the only people who practice this stuff are con artists like that's the whole problem is that everyone should learn this stuff it's it's interpersonal relationships right so like even as a psychiatrist like i do this stuff with my patients but it's not like to you know be nefarious with them it's like holding healthy boundaries so for example if i have a patient who's chronically late for appointments they show up 20 minutes late i still stop on time because i have another patient or even if i don't have another patient i still stop on time because it's like when they're like you know like is that manipulating it's like shaping behavior absolutely because i've seen the opposite which is that when you let your patients show up late they're going to show up late if there's no cost to them they're going to show up late so this is kind of bizarre so at one point in my practice 70 of the people in my my patient panel was free i didn't charge him a penny okay and guess who never showed up what do you guys think like my my um you know show up rate was for people who paid to see me versus people who got it for free people who pay show up absolutely hey wyvern good to see you man right so i had something like a 95 attendance rate for my paying clients maybe even higher and something like an 80 attendance rate for my free clients sure so so snowing he goel is saying i'm chronically late because of adhd that's totally fine i had patients with adhd too you and they actually tended to be pretty good about it because like they like if you value it like it works pretty well and that's where as a psychiatrist you've got to be understanding right so if someone like skips two sessions like if someone is usually attending and then skips two sessions and it turns out that they're depressed like you have to be compassionate towards that i'm not saying that i'm firing people from my practice left and right but setting good boundaries helps them so like creating a situation which an adhd patient that like sort of helps them deal with their adhd and also like doesn't let their adhd run wild is like really important it's actually therapeutic for them to try to hold some kind of limits so sometimes with my adhd patients i would even do things like okay so you have a 4 pm appointment and i actually have an hour-long break so like if i know that i've got an adhd patient who sometimes runs late and stuff i'll do things like send them a reminder at three o'clock and be like hey you're going to make it for your 4 pm and they'll even say like oh i'm running late and i'll be like okay 4 15 no biggie let's i'll push my next i'll hold the slot until 5 15 so you should absolutely accommodate that's the tricky thing about you know being a psychiatrist is that you have patients who fundamentally are going to have challenges with like showing up on time either they'll be depressed they'll be high you know they'll have adhd they'll be anxious so there are all kinds of things oh like i've had like i had a patient who had an addiction who was like very anxious and they were like i relapsed and i was terrified to tell you so like even though i got sober like i couldn't like i was terrified of how you'd respond so they're like didn't show up to the appointment when you like talked about it next week right it's sort of like bro like i get that you're terrified and like you know i want to have compassion for that but also like i deserve better right like i spent a week worrying about you i didn't know where you were you weren't answering my texts like that's not fair to me and so i know it sounds kind of weird but like that actually is very healthy it's like respecting this person and saying hey you actually have agency you have responsibility you have an impact in the world i understand you have anxiety but like there are other people out there that could be affected by that right and i i think that's where i got the best outcomes which is like not like oh my poor baby you have adhd that means you're completely incapable of anything and everything is forgivable and acceptable it's like dude i forgive you for it but like try to do better next time because i'm a person you know and i think that's when like that's when my patients do really well is when you like it's kind of interesting but in psychiatry what's happening is we're disempowering people by making excuses for them so like it goes back to you know something that i've heard several times which is like it's not your fault but you're responsible and i think that's like the best attitude for all my patients in order for them to do well i have to help them understand that they have power over their illness and having power over their illness in turn means having responsibility for their illness so if you're like manic so i once had a patient who took all their was like adherent with bipolar treatment went to an international conference to present a paper during their period of jet lag their sleep got messed up and they became manic i don't blame them an iota for that because kind of not their fault right like they didn't realize that they didn't think about it i didn't think about it they kind of became manic because their sleep got messed up totally fine next time around though it is their fault right so next time around hey i've got an international conference okay let's think about this maybe you should go a day early so you can like adjust to your sleep schedule maybe what i need to do is prescribe you some sleep medicine so it helps you get on your circadian rhythm and doesn't trigger your mania it is our responsibility yeah they should take melatonin absolutely oh walls of corn ervin yallam talks about this and this relational way to conduct therapy sounds like we have a real student of the psychological sciences in chat ah this is a great question okay dr k in case someone me has these manipulative actions if you're the one doing the manipulating how do we get better fantastic question so if you are the one who is the narcissistic family member the main thing to understand is watch what you're why you're doing what you're doing watch what you're why you're doing what you're doing so like when you start manipulating people right like understand what you're trying to get out of it what's your end goal and just pay attention to that process that's the first thing is to recognize that like you know if for example you feel ashamed so another good example that i'll give you guys is i once had a patient who so two twin sisters fraternal twins okay so not monozygotic so not like genetically identical they're around 25 years old one of the twins is my patient so they're both like pretty much the same through college and then after college one twin decides to get healthy so she loses like 10 or 15 pounds like starts to get super fit starts to take care of herself my patient lets herself go so over the course of three years like every you know because they they like look alike right because they're twins and then over like the next three years like one of them is gaining weight and one of them is losing weight and boy does that create problems because it's sort of like you know like so they they go to thanksgiving and then one you know their cousins and stuff will be like oh you look great like what are you doing like you look like you're super in shape to her sister they just don't say anything to her right they don't say like hey you're fat like she's not actually fat but and so then like my patient is like super you know does like all these like weird toxic things and it turns out like i didn't even realize but she's got all these other problems like in her workplace and in her relationships and things like that with her parents and the more we kind of talk about it she's like oh my parents are so mean to me my parents are so mean to me they like this sister so much they like this sister they play play favorites a lot that was her chief complaint when she came in the more we talk about it the more we're like no they don't actually play play favorites it's just you feel like less worthy than your sister so what happens is there's a cognitive bias in her mind that like amplifies any kind of insult right so it's not even an insult it's just like oh like she'll come in after thanksgiving she'll say my family ignores me and it's not that they actually ignore her it's just like in that moment the sister sees oh they're complimenting my sister on her weight loss and they're not saying anything to me therefore i feel ignored therefore i'm going to go complain to my psychiatrist that i am ignored and so it's great i mean we worked on it for a while and we kind of challenge that right like why do you feel that way where does that come from what happens and the more that we tunnel down into it i would ask her this question when do you feel ignored so this kind of goes back to like what do you do about it you notice the feelings as they arise don't worry about fixing it or stopping the manipulative behavior don't worry about that yet you have to understand where it arises and the more that we understand where it arises that's when we uncovered oh like i felt it because my you know they complimented my sister and then how then i'd ask like how do you feel about them complimenting your sister well like she deserves it and i'd be like i'm confused i'd be like what do you mean she deserves it well she's like 30 pounds lighter than i am i'm like okay well tell me about that and so then we uncover the story about how like her sister has been like taking care of herself and then she in turn feels ashamed right so then what she does is since since she feels ashamed she starts acting out and manipulating people into helping her feel better so she'll start like throwing tantrums and stuff like that she'll start like crying and like like other things like very publicly but trying to hold it in and then when she starts crying like people like give her attention and that that kind of creates conflict because like her sister is like you know what are you doing and so if you're the person who is doing the manipulation understand that you have particular needs that need to be met and for whatever reason the way that you were taught or conditioned to have those needs needs met is by expressing these like hyperbolic things for lack of a better term term so you'll kind of create conflict or have like attention seeking behavior another good example of this is something called parasuicidal gestures so like you have parasuicidal gestures like a good example of this so there's a lot of research into why men kill themselves more often than women so women attempt suicide more men kill themselves way more than women so it's like four to one ratio of completed suicides for for every one woman who kills herself four men kill themselves but for every one man who commits suicide or tries to commit suicide it's arguable that maybe four women attempt suicide so then when you kind of tunnel down into it what you see is that there's a lot of parasuicidal gestures so this is where like uh i mean it's not always this way but women for example you prefer overdoses men like prefer firearms so what what will happen is a woman will say like okay so they'll take a bunch of pills and they'll text someone they'll say like i'm saying goodbye and then the person will be like what do you mean you're saying goodbye you're freaking me out she's like don't worry you'll understand soon they'll be like super like vague about it this is a parasuicidal gesture it doesn't have to be a woman and so they'll like do something that is suicidal but like have a high visibility of it they'll tell let the whole world know goodbye world i'll see you tomorrow or i'll never see you again i hope the rest of you have wonderful lives and then like people will like rescue them right so the attempt is low lethality high visibility so if you talk to those people why are they doing that it's because they they're trying to get an emotional need met and sometimes people who just aren't taught how to articulate their feelings the only way they've learned because when they were 15 or 16 they said i want to kill myself and then people started paying attention right it's not their fault it's like this is a 15 year old who's been ignored for the last five years abused and they say like i want to kill myself because that's actually how they feel they don't want to live this life anymore and then suddenly everyone comes swooping in and suddenly we care right like suddenly we care if you're suicidal and that's the lesson that they learn is the only time people care is if you're suicidal and that's how you get parasuicidal gestures right and then we get that sort of like even in relationships oh if you leave me i'm going to kill myself because that's how that person has learned that's how society and people have taught this person how you can get your needs met how can you guarantee that this person won't abandon you because what you're really afraid of is being left alone you're afraid of abandonment well i can get him to stay if i tell him i'm going to kill myself yeah hello yeah who is it hi what's up okay okay you want to stay here with me okay hi hi dad hi love bye bye okay i mean you can say can you play for a little bit by by their serif and then i'll come be with you in a little bit okay love you okay thanks darl i love my kids what can i say um i have to scroll all the way down so apparently my wife and older daughter are going to the grocery store the younger one and i are going to hang out all right um yeah i just had a brain fart so people are going to get their emotional needs met however they want to or however they need to and if you're that kind of person you know that's okay just like understand it starts with understanding how what the need is that needs to be met and um yeah i don't i'm sure there's some relation to that but i think uh yeah i'm just thinking about my children now so i forgot what i was talking about and right back to suicide i can't think about suicide now okay let's meditate and then we'll figure out who to raid how does that sound oh my god i don't actually need to wear this i don't even know why i've had that on the whole time okay so we're going to teach you the how to survive holidays meditation i gotta now just make that up real quick let's think about this so let me think let me think okay so we're going to do a meditation that involves um okay we're going to do some abdominal meditation we'll teach you guys something else on friday okay so we're going to do two chakra meditations one is going to be like a processing your emotions in the moment while you're interacting with family members and the second is going to be a meditation that's geared towards improving interpersonal relationships okay so this is going to be a manipura chakra meditation there we go so that involves so first thing that we're going to do is sit up okay so we're going to sit up straight try not to swivel and then i don't know oh no chat we're swiveling okay so what money pura m-a-n-i-p-u-r-a so i want you all to sit up straight and close your eyes okay this is going to be a little bit more of a guided meditation no chatting chat eyes closed okay so we're going to put ourselves in the situation of you're at your home for the holidays and the stuff that pisses you off is pissing you off okay whatever that may be it may be that your cousins are making fun of you it may be that one of your parents is throwing a temper tantrum it may be that your grandmother is asking you when you're going to get married because you're indian and all your life you've been told no dating no dating no dating and then suddenly it's when are you getting married and having kids why aren't you married yet no girlfriend why aren't you married your cousin in india is married so whatever it is whatever is going on that pisses you off so try to think about that recall that feeling what do they say that annoys you you maybe you've got a career outside of medicine why don't you be doctor doctor is good it is noble profession but the reason we value is because of the financial we all call it our noble profession but we care about the money right maybe it's politics whatever it is just call up recall that memory prepare mentally in your mind for that situation and now what we're going to do is take a deep breath in and we're going to expand our belly out so we're going to take that cool air and put it all the way down into our belly button and then as we breathe out we're going to breathe out that heat and that tension and then as we breathe out we're going to breathe out that heat and that tension so feel that toxicity that swirls up inside you in your in your chest in your throat and how it creates tightness anger sweatiness and as we breathe in expand the throat expand the chest expand the belly and then let it all relax and as you let it relax the recoil happens in your belly the recoil happens in your intercostal muscles or chest your throat relax and you feel that hot air come out that is the tension and the negativity so again take a deep breath in feel the throat expand chest expand abdomen expand and as you exhale notice the transience of things you can continue to breathe expanding the throat expanding the chest expanding the throat expanding the chest expanding the abdomen and feel that cool air envelop the inside of your body and as you relax notice the heat and the tension leave that the tightness in your chest and the tightness in your throat is relaxing and then take for a moment notice for a moment that all breaths come to an end that each inhalation stops and becomes exhalation and that each in exhalation stops and becomes inhalation that any given sensation of opening of your throat or relaxing of your throat your throat of tightening in the chest or expanding the chest of the belly moving out or in all of these things are transient and now say to yourself this too shall pass this too shall pass that all things that happen with your family will come to a close that despite the whirlwind that is your family's holiday situation despite all the tensions the joys the frustrations the comparisons the embarrassments all of those feelings are transient that if you need to you can take a dip into this place within yourself this too shall pass you can continue the practice expanding the throat expanding the chest expanding the abdomen or you can let your breathing return to normal return to normal with a full inhalation in that moment repeat to yourself this shall pass and as you expel all of the air out repeat to yourself this shall pass in the spaces between inhalation and exhalation find your stillness and in that way with all the ups and all the downs in the in-between spaces you shall also in the in-between spaces you shall also find your stillness we'll practice for about another minute you can now let your eyes remain closed wiggle your toes wiggle your fingers shrug your shoulders a little bit stretch your neck and let yourself start to return back to the world and notice for a moment that the holidays may not be the best time and there may be all of these dynamics going on that they may be challenging for you to deal with and have some compassion for yourself they don't need to be fixed right away you will survive whatever comes you will enjoy whatever you can in what comes next and have some compassion for your family that despite all the tension despite all the difficulty despite all the difficulty it isn't necessarily their fault that things are the way that they are it isn't your fault that things are the way they are and yet in the smallest way possible try to take some responsibility what can you change what can you affect and as best as you can have faith in your family that if you start to treat them with compassion and start to articulate what is happening as you raise awareness that they'll start to move in the right direction as well it's fine to be skeptical but try to cultivate within yourself a tiny amount of hope because at the end of the day your family are probably decent people who are not always bad so you can count on them too it may just take a little bit of time with that go ahead and come back and have a happy thanksgiving chat
