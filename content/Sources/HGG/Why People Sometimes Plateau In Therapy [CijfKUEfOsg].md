 So sometimes in therapy we end up plateauing. You've made some progress, but at the end of the day you kind of start to stall, and it seems like therapy isn't helping as much. But frequently what happens is in a therapeutic relationship there's this weird power dynamic that develops, and this therapist is here to help us become better. So what's the therapist's job? The therapist's job is to help us, and what's our job? Our job is to actually get better. And if you stop getting better, it can kind of feel like it's your fault, because the therapist is there, they're helping you and supporting you all the time, and you're just not doing enough to take that help and turn it into progress. So oftentimes patients are very, very hesitant to share that they're plateauing in therapy because they're afraid of disappointing their therapist. You're such a good person, you're helping me all the time, and all I need to do is get better, but it doesn't seem to be working.
