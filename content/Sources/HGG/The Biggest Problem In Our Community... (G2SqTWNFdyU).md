 1% progress is better than zero. Well said, Rockstar. You know what the biggest problem in our community is? The biggest problem in our community is when we say, if you get 1% better, that's a win, right? You've made progress. That's a W. Goes in the W column. Then what we do when we do get 1% better is we move it over to the L. We take our wins and we turn them into losses. I could have done 2%. First way that we reduce it to an L. Second way reduce it to a L. That person did 2% and I only did 1%. Now a W moves to the L. Third thing we say to ourselves, oh, why didn't I do this yesterday? Takes a W and moves it into an L. You want to know why everyone is stuck today? It's because we take all of our wins and we book them as losses. And then we look at our lives and we're like, it's a string of Ls all the way down. That's the problem. Data that shows that people who have imposter syndrome do this. Number one thing that leads to imposter syndrome, the one behavior you can change to fix imposter syndrome is stop moving your Ws to Ls. And we all do it every single day.
