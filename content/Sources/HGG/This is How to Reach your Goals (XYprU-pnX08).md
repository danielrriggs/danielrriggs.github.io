 Abandon the shoulds. You ain't living this life for the sake of other people. Why are you living this life? So forget about the perfect self because this is where you are and focus on taking this step this step this step Because here's the thing when this is what I want to be and this is where I am When I take one step forward, i'm not there. I'm not there. I'm not there even going halfway feels like a failure If you go halfway, you feel like a failure even though you moved halfway Whereas if you're starting from here one step two step three step four step, this is a success This is a failure. Do y'all get that moving halfway to an ideal goal feels like a failure moving five steps forward from where you are Feels like a success. It's all about attitude. It's all about the conception of should so let go of it all accept where you are This is what when people say like oh live in the present. This is what they're talking about
