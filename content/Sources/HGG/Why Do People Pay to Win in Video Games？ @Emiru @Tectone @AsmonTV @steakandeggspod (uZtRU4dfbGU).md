 people feel like they perceive a bigger sense of accomplishment the harder something is. Well then why the hell do people pay to win in games? I know that answer. Well, yeah, let's hear it. Because it's f***ing fun. So when we talk about pay to win, what kind of game are we talking about? We are talking about any game like let's say Honkai Star Rail just came out recently. The three of us have played it. You spend money and there's a chance for you to get something that will be more powerful than what you have. Yeah, a better unit that free-to-play players can get. Yeah, so I think it's because it's the same reason why people cheat to get into med school, right? Because the reward that you get at the end when I beat something in a particular game or I down this boss, if I could pay to win to beat Millennia, I still get to walk around and say, hey, I beat Millennia. Yeah, I've got the sword now. Right? So now what's started to happen is we place value on accomplishments within games. And if you suck too much to do them, you just pay to win. Yeah.
