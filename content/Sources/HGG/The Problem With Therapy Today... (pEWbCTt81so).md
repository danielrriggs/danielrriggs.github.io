 So this frustration that I have with the field of therapy and the sort of introduction to coaching is literally why we started a coaching program. It's one of the things that I got the most frustrated about is that if you look at therapists, we do not take responsibility for improving external things in people's lives. We absolutely take responsibility for improving clinical outcomes, like reducing feelings of depression. But therapists, generally speaking, if you walk into an office and you say, hey, can you help me accomplish this in this amount of time, most therapists will shy away from that. And that's because that's not what we're trained for. And this is why the field of coaching is emerging so much. It's because there's a whole ability to use everything we understand about the psychology of the mind, but point in a different direction, which is not healing on the inside, but accomplishing on the outside.
