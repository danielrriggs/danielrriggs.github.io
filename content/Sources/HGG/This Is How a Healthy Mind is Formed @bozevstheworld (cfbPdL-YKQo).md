 A healthy mind does not exist simply within one body. A healthy mind is really built through relationships. And if we sort of look at humanity, like we're kind of tribal, right? So a lot of our mental well-being comes from outside of us. Yes, we're social creatures. Absolutely. And one of the most devastating things is that even when I make kind of content, right? Where people are like, how do I fix this? The really scary thing is that I'm not sure that the way that problems are fixed can solely be done by you. And in fact, I wonder if we've actually done people a huge disservice by telling them, hey, if you are mentally ill, this is something for you to fix. Because then what happens is that it sort of places the responsibility on them. And I think everyone has some degree of responsibility. But then if you fall short, then it becomes your fault again, which can then repeat the cycle. And push the narrative that you believe even further into you. Right, which is that you're to blame. Yes.
