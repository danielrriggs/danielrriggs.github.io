 So I want you all to think about why we have emotions for a second. We'll really understand this point. It's like 5000 years ago. If a human being experienced a negative emotion, like feeling lonely, what could they do to make that emotion go away? That negative emotion would prompt them to engage with other human beings in the same way that hunger prompts me to eat. That's negative, right? Makes me feel bad. Thirst prompts me to drink. Loneliness prompts me to reach out to other people. That's why we have negative emotions, because they prompt us towards the most important behaviors. Nowadays, we have a very serious problem, because when we play a video game, we can make the loneliness go away for a little bit, but it doesn't actually fix any of our problems. So we don't actually progress or improve in our life at all. So we're taking away that negative emotional energy, leading ourselves to literally not learn and also not progress in life.
