 So the other thing is if you look at the research on introverts and extroverts, it's like population-based, right? So they'll say that if I take a thousand extroverts and a thousand introverts, 600 of them will enjoy a party, whereas 400 of the introverts will enjoy a party. But you've still got 400 introverts who somehow figured out how to have fun at a party, and you've still got 400 extroverts who, despite the fact that they're extroverts, find parties to be very, very hard to get through, right? That's my point, is that it's not deterministic. There are large populations of introverts who are very social. I'm kind of like that, so I like when I was in college, I like learned how to socialize. So I had a rule for myself that I was never going to eat lunch alone, and I was never going to have lunch with the same person twice in one week. Simple, simple rule to teach yourself how to socially interact while also not pushing yourself too far. It's like one hour a day for five days a week.
