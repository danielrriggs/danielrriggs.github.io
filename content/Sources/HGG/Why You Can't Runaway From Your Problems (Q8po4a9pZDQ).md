 We view transformation of the self as like separate from the rest of our lives. Whereas the big lesson I learned in India is like, I don't have to be in India to become a monk. In fact, running away to India was just running away from my problems and a subtle way for my ego to like outperform people who are outperforming me. So when someone, you know, when my friends and stuff like got 4.0 GPAs and got into medical school and I failed to get into medical school for the second time in a row, I was like, OK, well, let me go become a monk. Because then I'm above all of this rat race. All these doctors who are chasing money. I'm better than all of them. I'm not materialistic, etc, etc. It's all running away from my problems. And then I realized through thankfully a lot of brilliant teachers and some, you know, effort on my own part that I'm going to take my problems with me wherever I go. They're my problems running away to India. Like I'm going to take them with me so you can move to a new town. But like your sense of disgust. Well, where is it coming from? Like, where does it live? It lives up here.
