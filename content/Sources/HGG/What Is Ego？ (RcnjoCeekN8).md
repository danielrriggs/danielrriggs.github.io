 So let's understand what is ego. When you say I am dot dot dot, anything that comes after the I am dot dot dot is part of your ego. Anything on your resume is part of your ego. So ego is a construct. It is not actually who you are or what you are. So I can say that I am a doctor, but that is not a real thing. You can't biopsy me and find a doctor. You can't like x-ray me and find a doctor. I was me before I was a doctor and I'm me after I was a doctor. So how can being a doctor be a part of who I truly am? What it is is a part of ego, right? It is a construction that I wrap around myself. And the really interesting thing about this is like once you discover that you are not, I'm not really a doctor, like I wasn't born a doctor, and it has value, don't get me wrong. So the ego serves a purpose, but it's not truly who you are. So then the question becomes, okay, well who am I? And the cool thing about that is if anything that is related to ego is not who you are, it's incredibly liberating.
