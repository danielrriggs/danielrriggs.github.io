 Just think about what you were really taught about maintaining relationships. If you struggle to maintain a relationship, even at the age of 25, do your parents sit down with you and say, hey, you seem kind of lonely. Like, what are you doing? Did your parents even maintain relationships? And so once you start to realize, and what I discovered as a psychiatrist is there's no such thing as a loser. It does not exist. It's a judgment that we make out of ignorance of what is this person's circumstances? What is their upbringing? What were they taught? What were they given? And what I started to see is there's no such thing as a loser. It's just their karma. Does that mean that they deserve it? That's not what karma is about. Karma is about understanding what are all the thousand different things that form together to create a human being in the year 2022 at the age of 25 and how much does that person control?
