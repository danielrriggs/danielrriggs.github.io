 So if you're highly perfectionistic, chances are you grew up in a situation where there were unrealistic standards. So this can look like harsh, narcissistic, or tiger parents who expected you to be perfect, and no matter how hard you try, they were always disappointed. Or if you did perfect, that's the norm. So if you were at the top of your class, that's just what they expect. That's the baseline. And so if you sort of think about perfectionism, you can either do normal or you can disappoint. There's no way to make your parents proud if they're expecting you to be at the top of the class all the time. Sometimes this also happens in a case of like golden boy or golden girl where you have an older brother or sister who did awesome, right? So really harsh parents, really high expectations, and your sibling knocked it out of the park. Which means now you're expected to do it too because your parents have unrealistic expectations, but they were able to pull it off, so now you should be able to pull it off.
