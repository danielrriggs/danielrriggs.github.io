 So if you're average, first of all, totally cool, no big deal. Main thing you need to think about internally, has there been a voice inside you? Has there been some kind of passion? Are you risk averse and passion averse? And the rest of the world told you, hey, don't do that stuff because it's silly. If it did start to tunnel down into that and start to awaken that voice a little bit. As you awaken that voice, as you lean into your passion, you may one day become exceptional. On the flip side, if you're average and you're actually okay with it, you don't need to be exceptional. Not everyone in life needs to be exceptional. You can chase it if you want to. But if you're happy, it's okay to be happy. And you don't have to anticipate all the problems in the future and start grinding today. If you're in your 20s and you are actually enjoying the life that you're living, making a moderate amount of money with moderate relationships, with a moderate amount of fun, you do not need to sacrifice the best years of your life to avoid some hypothetical problem down the road. If the rest of the world is telling you that you need to be grinding, but internally you're kind of content, lean into that, baby.
