 So the more accomplished you are, the more likely you are to feel imposter syndrome. And we've seen this a lot in our career coaching program and our creator coaching program, where we work with people like YouTube creators and Twitch creators, and all of them have imposter syndrome. And why is that? It's because imposter syndrome is not actually, while it's harmful, it's also adaptive. So it's a harmful adaptation. And how is it adaptive? Well, that's because someone with imposter syndrome, instead of celebrating when they do a good job, what they is panic and work twice as hard. If you're panicking all the time and working twice as hard, do you suffer? Sure. But you're also going to be very, very, very accomplished and very successful because you're working hard all the time. And as people are able to acknowledge the things that they've done that deserve success, as people are able to acknowledge that if someone else is successful, maybe they got a little bit lucky too. And lastly, as people are able to take pride in themselves instead of relying on someone else's validation, that's when you start to see imposter syndrome get a lot better.
