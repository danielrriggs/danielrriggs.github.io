 The gender breakdown is more men than women, but the research is kind of mixed. So I'd say that if you look at, let's say, the population under 18, I'd say that 8.4% of people under the age of 18, maybe about 11% to 12% of boys, maybe like 6% to 7% of women. So if you look at other kinds of internet-related addictions, like social media addiction, that is more predominantly women. There are also breakdowns in terms of what kinds of games people are addicted to, so women are more likely to spend way more time playing mobile games than men are. So a lot of this research is kind of emerging, but it does seem like there is kind of a gender gap, at least in terms of men versus women.
