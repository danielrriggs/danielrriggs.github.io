 So we're going to teach y'all a little bit about how to cultivate the right thinking. Usually negative thoughts start first, and then they will activate emotions, and then the emotions will spur more thoughts. Now this is when we get into things like thought loops, right? So I start to think to myself, I feel sad, and then the sadness breeds more negative thoughts. There's some kind of like affective change, emotional change, that then propagates further thoughts. And y'all may have experienced this negative experience of a thought loop where you can't stop your mind from thinking. And when I work with patients who have thought loops like this, what they want more than anything else is to just stop thinking. And instinctively they know that the thinking is the problem. This is why they reach for things like substances or video games or technology or any kind of distraction to shut off the thoughts. This is why people will drink a lot of alcohol before they pass out, because I need to stop the thoughts. I need to stop the thoughts. And why do we reach for those kinds of things? Because we haven't been trained at how to cultivate the right thoughts.
