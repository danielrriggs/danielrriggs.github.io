 One thing that I've sort of found is when people are really, really angry at society, they don't really realize that anger doesn't actually come from society. It comes from their experiences. So, for example, the number one, I've worked with a ton of people who are incels or red pillars or whatever. And the number one thing that is common amongst all of them is trauma usually associated with a woman. So something just incredibly traumatic and crushing happened to them. And so then what they have to do is it's sort of like, it's a survival mechanism. Their brain adapts to fear and even hate that thing. Right? Like if I get bit by a snake, I'm not going to want to cuddle with snakes. And then I think they really fall into traps because as you start to intellectualize and you point at society, instead of understanding your own bias and what effect it has had on you, then you really start to screw things up because if the problem exists within you, like no amount of changing society is going to fix it. Yes.
