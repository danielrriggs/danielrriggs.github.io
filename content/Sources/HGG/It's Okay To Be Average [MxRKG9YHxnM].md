 But maybe I should be grinding. The rest of the world is telling you that you should be more passionate and you should be like better and you should be hungrier and you should be like creating passive income and you should be working at Google instead of like whatever mid-size like web development company you're working at. And the external world is telling you that you should be unhappy because people who are content with less than everything are idiots. And this is a huge problem in our society. We don't allow people to be content with average. And so the second thing that I'll help people work through is like they're actually okay with being average but they're not okay with being average. So they come to me looking for permission or license or for me to say, hey it's actually okay for you to be average.
