 When you experienced emotions in your household, how were those emotions responded to? So if you got pissed off, were you punished for it? If you got scared, were you punished for it? If you started crying at home, did your parents get mad at you for crying and call you ungrateful? So if we sort of look at these situations, what we're starting to realize is that the things that happen within you start to become problematic. If I get pissed at my parents, what's going to happen if I start yelling at my parents? They're going to punish me for it, right? And so then if you sort of stop and think about it, what's happening in your brain? What is the lesson that your brain learns? Your brain learns the lesson that expressing emotions, feeling emotions, and even trying to build some kind of plan for the future is an absolute waste of time at best and is actually something that hurts and punishes us at worst.
