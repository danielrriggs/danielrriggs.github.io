 The basic issue with being a virgin is that in life we have milestones. We start dating at a particular age, we get laid by a particular age, a certain milestone. And what happens is as we miss those milestones, we start to lack faith in ourselves. We start to become insecure about ourselves. As we become insecure about ourselves, it becomes easier to miss further milestones. This is the virginity trap. Since I'm insecure and I haven't gotten laid in high school when I go to college or uni, now I can't get laid there because I'm a virgin. I don't know how it works. So then I don't get laid in college and now I don't know how to date and now I feel more insecure. So the more you miss milestones, the more insecure you feel, the easier it is to miss milestones and the harder it is to catch up.
