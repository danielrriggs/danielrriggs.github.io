 This is a core tenet, by the way, of Stoicism. In Sanskrit, it's called Vairagya, to detach from your life, right? To recognize that you as a human being are independent of all that crap out there. Because the moment that your emotions and your worth gets tied into it, you surrender the control of like your effort and your ability to like set limits on things. Then what happens is you end up burning out, right? Because now you're like devoting 100% effort for like a promotion that comes with a 10% raise, and then you don't get it. And now you're like, well, screw it, why did I do all that crap anyway? And then you feel bad about yourself. And then you vow to yourself that you should quit and never again. And now I'm going to join the anti-work movement. And then you become resentful. But even that is the same problem, because you are still letting your resentment dictate your actions. As long as your emotions are dictating your actions, you're in big trouble.
