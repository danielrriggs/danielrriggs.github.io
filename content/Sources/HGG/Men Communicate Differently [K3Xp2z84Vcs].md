 So my favorite example of how men communicate differently is the negative expression of a positive affection. So when we like someone and we're proud of one of our homies or our bros, we don't say that to them, right? In fact, what we do is we kind of dog them about it. If my friend has been single for a while after a bad breakup and starts dating someone else and I feel really proud and good about that, I don't say, hey, friend, I'm really proud of you and I'm proud that you've been able to find someone who sees the lovable qualities within you that I see. I'm proud that you found someone who treats you the way that I think you deserve to be treated. In the history of humanity, I do not think that sequence of words has ever been spoken by a single man. That's not what we say. What do we say? We say, bruh, GG, noob, you're whipped. I guess we'll never see you again. And we're smiling the whole time. We're not like, I know you haven't been texting me. I feel hurt. Instead, what we do is we actually dog on this guy. We'll say all this like misogynistic crap. But the whole time we're like expressing appreciation and smiling at him.
