 Breastfeeding is something that really can be taught. So that they're actually like lactation consultants and nurses. And this is actually, it's actually a huge public health problem that we just assume that people will know how to breastfeed. But it's actually like really, really hard and can be really, really traumatic for moms and kids because then if you can't breastfeed properly, like you feel like you're not a good mom, you know, and then if you have to like resort to bottle feeding and then there's all like army of people who are like bottle feeding makes you a bad mother. Like I'd never thought about teaching that, but it's actually like a gigantic problem. Like a massive problem that makes so much of postpartum depression is linked to like the inability to breastfeed. And then if you're depressed, then like you don't produce enough milk and then the kid doesn't latch and then you feel stressed out and then you stop producing milk and it's hard to bond. It's like actually really bad and people don't talk about it enough.
