 How do you set effective boundaries on a kid who's addicted to video games? Kids are terrified. They're like, oh my god, Dr. K is going to quit my parents with the ability to control me. No, it's not really what we do. We sort of what we do. But we explain to the parents is like, if you want to set limits on video game addiction, you can't have your kid working against you. They've got to be on your team. You all are fighting against an addiction. There's no way you can win against an addiction if the person who's addicted is not trying to win. Impossible. So our parent coaching program is about helping parents understand their kids. How can you get them on your team and how can both of you all work towards something together? In terms of like personal coaching, it's like, you know, for most of you all, it's about the same thing. It's like understanding yourself. And even in that way, it's like all the self-sabotage that you do. Why the hell do you do that? Where does that come from? Instead of just assuming that you're incompetent or lazy, why don't you try to understand it for once? Why don't you try to like understand like why you do this to yourself and what needs you meet by sabotaging yourself?
