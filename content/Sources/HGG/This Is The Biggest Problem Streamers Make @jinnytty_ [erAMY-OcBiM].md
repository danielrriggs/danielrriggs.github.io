 The biggest problem that most streamers make, since sacrifice has caused you to grow, you assume that it is sacrifice that will continue to grow. Yeah. Whereas the big revelation that we've had, and I think this is what you would also agree with, because most streamers agree with this, is that when you're actually like not tired and exhausted and you feel pretty good about yourself, your streams are actually like higher energy, more enjoyable, and you actually do like better in the numbers. There's that fear driver that if I stop doing this, then people will slip away. But that's the big paradox, is that actually being well rested will bring more people in. But the problem is that that fear that if I take a break, like everyone will disappear. If you take extended breaks and like consistency is important, so there's absolutely like a big part of like consistency is a huge part in taking breaks. Extended breaks is very damaging for streaming. And even if some people are able to successfully do it, those people are outliers. The majority of streamers need to stream consistently in order to keep their numbers or grow. That's absolutely true. Yeah.
