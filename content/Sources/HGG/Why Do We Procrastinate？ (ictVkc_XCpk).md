 We've evolved to do this, like have this problem with future discounting, which basically means that we as a human species, this is the way we've evolved, value a dollar today more than two dollars a year from now. So we, our brains are wired, there's a part of our brain called the nucleus accumbens, and it's wired to value things that are immediate more than things that are distant. And so if you sort of think about it for a second, right, let's say I've got two things to do. I want to play a video game, let's say it's Friday, I've got to play a video game and I've got to fill out an application. So my brain looks at this problem and says, okay, I've got these two things to do, and due to future discounting, I can do my work today and then I can have fun tomorrow. But literally, my brain values fun today more than fun tomorrow. This is why we fundamentally as a species procrastinate.
