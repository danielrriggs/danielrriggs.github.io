 Men trip up with talking about their emotions. Talking about your emotions doesn't fix anything. Feeling that emotion rise up and be present when you are doing the talking is what actually fixes something. So I've seen a ton of men that will come into my office and will like pretend to do psychotherapy and I'll pretend with them. This means is that they come into the office, we talk about all the sad in their life and they're kind of like blase. They're like, yeah, and then this trauma happened and this trauma happened and this trauma happened. And if you're a dude, you may know what I'm talking about because you can numbly talk about these terrible things that have happened to you. There's no emotional activation. So the key thing to understand is that the emotional activation is the important part of processing your emotion.
