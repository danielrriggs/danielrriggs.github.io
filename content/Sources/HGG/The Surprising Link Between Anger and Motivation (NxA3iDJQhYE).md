 Today we're going to talk about the surprising link between getting pissed on the internet and being kind of stuck IRL So the first thing is that a lot of people think that these two things aren't linked and that's how I thought about it too When we sort of think about being pissed off online, we kind of think about things like rage bait, right? There's all kinds of stuff that gets kind of passed around the internet We think that things rise to the top because some CEO said something that pisses everyone off Or some popular figure did something that is really upsetting people Or we're kind of learning about like all these injustices in the world and all the Karens out there And we feel really really angry And on the flip side, we have problems with motivation Everyone's struggling with motivation and ADHD is on the rise and I can't kind of control what I want to do And even though there's a lot of stuff I should be doing, I can't bring myself to do it And we sort of think that that second thing is also related to stuff like dopamine and technology addiction and video game addiction And we sort of think about both of these as kind of individual or independent manifestations of the world we live in Hey there, thanks for watching and I'm glad these videos have been helpful A lot of times I'll read the comments and see people asking, well, what do I actually do about it? Which is a great question And unfortunately the resources out there haven't been that great Which is precisely why I started at HG in the first place HG coaches are trained on a curriculum that integrates my understanding of what motivates us What paralyzes us And most importantly, what leads to lasting behavioral change If you're ready to take the next step, HG coaches can help you build the life that you want They've helped people build careers, help people find relationships, build networks of friends And even do things like discover their passions or pursue hobbies So if this sounds like something that you'd be interested in, check out the link in the description below As I started to work with more and more people who struggle with motivation IRL And I started to assess their technology use I started to pick up a really interesting signal That there seemed to be a direct correlation between how stuck someone is IRL And how often they get pissed online And what I sort of realized is that this is actually a really classic trauma response That has a new manifestation in the digital age And so that may confuse you for a couple of reasons First of all, like how on earth is this a trauma response? Sounds like a stretch And secondly, I haven't really been traumatized so this probably doesn't apply to me But once I explain it, hopefully it'll make a little bit more sense So let's start with how is this a classic trauma response There are a lot of studies that have been done on trauma And we've looked at studies, for example, of like prisoners Like prisoners of war that are in concentration camps And we've also looked at people like kids in childhood abuse situations And what we sort of discovered is that in these situations The person who is kind of traumatized is in a situation where there is an inherent power dynamic And they're generally speaking powerless So there's some figure in their life that exercises complete control over their life And when you're in a situation where you can't exert any control Being angry becomes completely useless So even though injustices are being perpetrated on you Let's say you're a prisoner of war and the guards are treating you like crap or even abusing you Or you're in a home situation where your parent doesn't care what you think Doesn't care what you say Doesn't care how you feel And is controlling aspects of your life Getting pissed is actually damaging to you Because if you get pissed at the guards, they will punish you If you get angry and talk back to your parents, they will teach you the meaning of respect And so what happens in these situations where someone is controlling your life And you're not allowed to express anger? You start to express that anger in safe places Because the anger is in here It's gotta be expressed in some way And so what these kids and adults end up learning how to do Is they discover this one really important rule Which is that I'm not allowed to be angry unless it's in a safe space And what do those safe spaces look like? In some cases, this is kind of why we see kids who are in abusive households start to bully other kids So I'm pissed at home because my parents are treating me like crap But I can't do anything about that If I start talking back to them, the abuse is going to increase The toxicity is going to increase So where can I safely express anger? I can't express it to adults, right? I can't get mad at teachers because teachers will punish me But what I can do, what is the safest expression of anger Is I can find the smallest kid in class The least threatening kid And I can start to bully him And what we sort of see in adults and prisoners of war Is that they will oftentimes displace that anger in safe places And what does it mean to safely displace anger or safely express that anger? That means that you can express anger sort of as much as you want And there's a never-ending outlet for your anger And that there's no consequence to expressing the anger So when I express anger, I don't get punished in some way So I wonder if there is any situation that exists today Where I can get as mad as I want to And there are never any consequences I wonder if the internet allows me to do that Because the internet is full of rage bait And I can get pissed about this And I can get pissed about this And I can get pissed about this I can even type these really, really devastating comments Where I'm putting people in their place And teaching them how facts don't care about your feelings And all this kind of stuff And I can express and induce a lot of rage And there's really no consequence, right? Because what's the consequence of getting mad on the internet? Maybe I get banned from one community And I can just make another account and post there anyway Or I can just move to a different community So I started to realize that the internet is actually like One of these spaces where people can safely displace anger Now the next thing that you may be wondering about is Okay, fine, I get pissed off on the internet Maybe some of it is rage bait And maybe I'm displacing some of my anger But I wasn't really traumatized And this is where we have to think a little bit about These trauma responses are not necessarily due to Someone being a prisoner of war Or being physically abused in the household Really the threshold for this trauma response Is basically you growing up in an environment Where it was not safe to express anger And you ended up displacing it in other ways So if you had super controlling parents If you had parents or other caregivers That really didn't care about what you think And you weren't safely able to express your feelings And the number for, you know The number of people who fall under that That category is actually way higher I started to see this in a lot of people That were struggling with motivation And so the second thing to consider is that This trauma response doesn't really require Someone to have, you know, a diagnosis of PTSD You don't have to be a prisoner of war Or even have like physically abusive parents Really what engages this particular facet of trauma Is simply growing up in an environment Or being in an environment even today Where you are not safely allowed to express your anger So it could mean having really controlling parents That if you talk back to them Or you get angry, they punish you for anger It could even be something like a work situation Where if someone treats you unfairly You're not allowed to talk back to them You're not allowed to even contradict them You can even do it in a respectful way But you still kind of get punished for it And the number of people that fall into this category Is way higher And now what does this have to do with motivation? If you look at the trauma literature What you actually discover is that These people who are not safely allowed to express anger Also struggle with motivation In the literature specifically There's a term called the paralysis of initiation Which talks about how these people Struggle to get tasks started And are motivated towards completion And if we sort of think about it And we start to understand Okay, what does anger do for us? What does anger do to our brain? This will start to make a lot more sense So if we think about different emotions There are some emotions that will lead to things like avoidance Like fear and shame And there are some emotions that are actually motivating emotions And anger is kind of at the top of the list there And you'll see this even if you look at like media representations, right? So when you've got like the hero or heroine Who's in this situation of injustice Where they're the good guy and there's a bad guy And things are unfair What is their emotion that causes them to rise to the challenge? What is the emotion that motivates them, right? I'm never gonna let this stand This is never gonna happen again I'm not gonna take it laying down I'm gonna get pissed And so if we think about these classically negative emotions Which ones do the people who are heroes or heroines Actually experience the most? They experience anger That's exactly what anger is designed to do, right? So if we think about it from an evolutionary perspective When I get pissed I'm willing to put myself in dangerous situations And the anger is what sort of conquers that fear And conquers that shame Conquers that danger That's what really allows me to be focused And sort of even fight with a tiger or a lion Or engage in physical combat, right? Because when do human beings fight? They fight when they get pissed And so the really interesting thing is that once we take that anger And we're not able to channel it towards motivation And we're kind of displacing it to random strangers on the internet We sort of lose that motivational drive And you may sort of notice this Where there are periods in your life Or situations in your life Where you know you should be doing something, right? And you kind of feel pissed off about it That you feel so incapable Or you can't really stand up for yourself Or you're unable to set a boundary with someone And for some reason you're just Anytime there's kind of this power dynamic situation Or you're kind of struggling to like work up that internal motivation You don't really know what to do And so what people end up doing is they think that this is related to willpower Or I need to wake up earlier Or I need to start this new tropic But fundamentally what's going on is this is actually a trauma response And so what I discovered working with these people Who, you know, get pissed off on the internet and struggle with motivation Is that focusing on that trauma And letting them sort of healthily reintegrate anger Into their lives Allowed them to actually move forward So the first thing to understand is whether you actually fit into this pattern or not So ask yourself a couple of questions Like first question is, you know, do I feel angry at times in my life And I don't actually do anything about it If you sort of recognize that that's the case There's another interesting kind of diagnostic question that you can ask When I feel angry, is there a part of my mind that tells me Getting angry at this person is dangerous Anger only causes you to mess things up even further Do you have a natural reaction to anger that is actually fear So oftentimes with these people experiences There's a spike of anger followed by a bigger spike of fear And the fear kind of conquers the anger And then sort of tells you, hey, don't do anything about it, right It warns you It sort of creates some anxiety And then what you end up doing is getting pissed at something on the internet You open up your phone You start scrolling through stuff And then you sort of click on the rage bait inducing stuff And if you really pay attention to that pattern What you may find is that this time when you're browsing the internet or social media Your mind gravitates not towards cute cat videos But things that piss you off And so the next thing to kind of consider is that if this sort of fits you You can absolutely see a trauma-informed therapist Or someone who's trauma-informed and kind of work on those motivational issues But the other thing that I would strongly encourage you to do Is sort of start to develop that healthy relationship with anger And start by just noticing, okay, I feel anger and I feel fear What is the fear telling me not to do? And then take a step back from those things Maybe meditate for a second And then ask yourself, okay, if someone else were in this situation What would I advise them to do? And then what you want to try to do is come up with a plan that sort of satisfies the anger But also satisfies the fear And we don't really do this because we just jump to avoidance, right? But there may be some way to respectfully tell someone Hey, what you're doing is like actually a little bit unfair And the problem is that your mind is going to be scared of even these situations Because it learned a long time ago that even respectful disagreement leads to punishment But if you're 10 years older, 15 years older and your situation is different You're not in that abusive household You're actually in a job where there's more respect hopefully Then you can actually try to pilot some of those interventions And this is exactly the kind of stuff that we try to teach people When they come into coaching and stuff Is how do you understand your emotions and how can you sort of figure out this middle path That is not giving into your initial reactions But also helps you move forward So I know it sounds kind of bizarre But we sort of think about anger as being induced by rage bait on the internet Which is absolutely the case There is a piece of rage bait there And we also think about motivation as being related to dopamine and sort of technology addiction And there's absolutely a piece of that as well But what I've really discovered is that there's a hidden link between these two things And it's actually a novel manifestation of a classic trauma response
