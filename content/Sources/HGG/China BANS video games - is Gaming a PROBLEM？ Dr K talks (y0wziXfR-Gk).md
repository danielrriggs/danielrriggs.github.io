 So I don't know if you guys heard this but There was recently I think like as of this weekend so China actually Passed a law that limits online video games to three hours a week for young people So what this law basically says so for those of you who don't know? When you play an online video game in China, this is correct me if I'm wrong I mean, I've talked to people in China and stuff But this is my understanding is that you have like a national ID that you know Anytime you sign up for a game like you link your account in game to your national ID And so then what they what they've essentially done is they've like instituted this this law That you are not allowed to play games like Monday through Thursday at all So all of your accounts are linked to this national ID and so they're like don't let you play those games and then on Friday Saturday and Sunday you're allowed to play I think one hour a day and they may even have restricted it from 8 to 9 p.m You also get to play one hour a day on holidays. So China recently passed this law And so we're gonna talk a little bit about it, you know why I think this is happening and then also like, you know What to kind of expect? going forward so the first thing to understand is that Video game addiction is like a big problem and we don't quite understand what the relationship between video game The increase in playing video games and a group of social movements is so like I mentioned earlier You know, there's stuff going on in lots of different countries. So in in, you know, the US and Europe will call them neat So these are people in not an employment education or training in South America. They're called nene's So need to debauch on the estudiar people who are not working or studying in in Japan, you know, I think they call them Hickokomori's And in China actually recently there's been like a big movement called laying flat Which is that there's a group of young people who are sort of like not engaging in like the work culture So China also recently passed their Supreme Court made a ruling that the 996 work culture Which is 9 a.m. To 9 p.m. Six days a week is actually illegal So there's this big culture and if you're Chinese, you know, feel free to correct me This I'm sort of hearing the second hand from colleagues of mine and friends of mine in China That you know, there's there's sort of like young people there are just not like not interested in working like they're not interested in You know grinding all day spending six days a week 12 hours a day For like a small amount of money and then like, you know getting on this this, you know Stairstepper of like walking every day and getting nowhere and eventually getting promoted and stuff There used to be a lot of you know Pride that people took in this kind of sacrificial work culture You see that kind of that that sacrificial work culture in Japan as well You see it in the United States You see it in residency for sure where people are like, you know I worked a hundred hours a week and it was like it was terrible but man I survived and like, you know there's like this really like machismo kind of like Culture where the harder you work and the more you deprive yourself like the more, you know Credentials you get the harder you train the more badass you are. There's this kind of like sentiment, right? But what's what we're seeing just across the world is that younger people, right? So we're talking like starts with the Millennials and Gen Z are just not signing into it And so people have hypothesized that video games are a big part of this I do think that they are a part of that but I think that what's happening is people are demonizing video games for Essentially like a lot of other societal problems. So, you know our video games kind of addictive Yeah, absolutely and we're gonna talk about that in a second but I think that what people here are missing is that there's a confluence of events that gets young people Uninterested in participating in society and then when I choose not to participate in society because I don't get paid enough I don't get enough respect. I don't enjoy my job. It's not fulfilling when all of those things happen, right? I'm I have tons of this student loan debt When all of those kinds of things happen Then I choose not to participate in society and when I choose not to participate in society What do I do with all my time? And so what I end up doing with all my time is like video games, right? So I think that there is an addictive component for sure which we'll get to in a second But I think essentially what's happening is that there's a great deal of unrest with young people, right? So people are concerned about climate change. They're concerned about wealth inequality They're concerned about all this kind of stuff, which are very valid concerns And so people are taking a step back and saying you know what? I'm just not gonna play this game and what they turn to is video games instead. There's also really interesting I'm gonna try to dig up this reference for you guys, but I saw You know, this is a paper that a buddy of mine at Harvard Business School sent me about young people's Young people entering the workforce is at an all-time low So historically like in the last hundred years, especially young men are at an all-time low for entering the workforce so it used to be that the demographic that Entered the the workforce and the most stable solid demographic of people kind of going into work We're like young men like men between the ages of 18 and 25 And for the first time like that number is like remarkably low and people are trying economists are trying to figure out You know, what's the reason for this chances are it's multifactorial But I think what we see is that people are not entering the workforce and they end up playing video games like what's going on there What's the cause? What's the effect? I imagine it's like somewhat circular and reinforcing, right? So video games make it harder for people to enter the workforce and when people are not interested in then entering the workforce They end up playing video games But I think what you see is a lot of institutions and governments and policymakers What they're doing is they see a Bunch of young people playing video games and they say that's the problem. That's what you see, right? It's like the tip of the iceberg Above the water, but it's not that what they don't ask themselves is why are these young people playing video games? Like sure they're playing video games, but what's the root cause? What's driving the behavior all they're sort of focusing on is the behavior itself? And this is something you know, you learn if you work in addiction psychiatry is like you can and oh my god I'm about to go off on a tangent But you can take an alcoholic and you can send them to rehab for 60 days where there's no alcohol available And this is the business model for like half of the rehabs out there They're like we're gonna take you to this awesome spa like place where you're not gonna have a choice to drink because there's no alcohol Available. So what we're gonna do is remove the problem from your life And that's what we're gonna call a rehab and these rehabs are fantastic because they don't address the underlying issues They don't address the drivers of behavior. They just restrict the behavior artificially And so people go to the rehabs they get sober for six six sixty days They feel awesome and then they go home and then alcohol is available. And what do they do? They relapse And when they relapse that's fantastic because you had such a good experience at that spa that charged you $70,000 I guess I need to go back because I had it. I was so good So it's this awesome business model that that you know encourages temporary sobriety and repeat customers And so what happens is I'm seeing a lot of these like policy level changes where people are sort of targeting video games as the problem And it's definitely a contributor. Don't get me wrong But I think it's sort of like that's that's the equivalent of taking an alcoholic and Sticking them in a rehab and preventing them from sort of like playing games, right? And that that amount of restriction could help it probably will help but it's not addressing the underlying causes And I think part of the the other kind of interesting thing here So I think what's gonna happen is that the law will pass and hopefully it'll help some but I think two things will happen Until you when you have a bunch of gamers who want to play video games, they'll find a way to play video games Okay so the first thing that a buddy of mine was explaining to me is that you know oftentimes like Like you have a national ID, right? So it's like linked to like your driver's license or whatever like so you have a national ID then you're a minor You're a 16 year old kid like what the 16 year old kid is gonna do is good They're gonna go at their grandpa's national ID and they're just gonna sync that with all their accounts and then it'll lift all the restrictions They'll keep playing games anyway It's not hard to find someone's like national ID to link a grandpa's not playing video games like you got grandpa You've got grandma. You've got mom. You've got dad You've got your great uncle got a bunch of people out there who aren't playing video games and you've got a bunch of national IDs So you're just gonna keep playing and I think that's what's gonna happen So as long as the driver for the behavior is there you can try to like suppress it, right? Like you can try to restrict we see this in addiction as well. We're like, you know, you know You know, there are kids who smoke pot and their parents don't want them to smoke pot. They're addicted to pot So what do they do like they find a way to smoke pot chat? They find a way to sneak out of their their house You know put a ladder outside their window climb down their friend meets them in their backyard They pass them a joint like they find a way to do the behavior So I think it's an interesting intervention. I think it's kind of an authoritarian approach that doesn't address some of the underlying problems I'm not surprised that the the passage of this legislation came now Because laying flat in China has been growing so much so like people have noticed right so I heard about it right now I'm not like in China. So I think that there's a there's an increasing amount of like Frustration and dissatisfaction with young people and so like policymakers are looking at that and they're saying oh video games are the problem right this is friggin video games like these stupid video games we see this from parents as well in our parent program where like You know parents will come in and they'll say like how do I get my kid to stop playing video games? Because like the video game is the problem the video game is like the abs you know that's the real problem like how do I get them to stop and What we do when we work with these parents is we like Hopefully the ones that work with us begin to realize like the video game is a symptom It's not the root cause and that if you really want to get your kid to stop playing video games You want to fight them constantly for it what you need to do is like get them on the same page and help them understand How video games are a problem and address the underlying issues sometimes it means getting your kid into therapy sometimes it means Helping your kids succeed in ways that like they're struggling with right sometimes it means being being like okay Do you like or do you feel you're overweight and people make fun of you like what do you think about like going to jiu-jitsu class? Would you be down to do that and then the kids are like yeah actually like that'd be pretty cool And so then like the the parent encourages them and it involves dealing with the underlying Drivers of behavior instead of restriction and when we do that it works out really really well So I think what's happening is this this measure is somewhat reactionary I think we're gonna see a lot of people bypassing it because that's what gamers are gonna Do they're gonna find a way to play games if they really want to? And at the same time I think it's also like in response to a growing Dissatisfaction that young people have and they're sort of blaming the video game for it now speaking of blaming video games I'm not surprised that this legislation passed for a couple of other reasons And I think we're gonna see more stuff like this actually all over the world Because the truth is that video game developers are actively trying to make their video games more addictive and more damaging to people So like what people are trying to do right so like like you know MMO makers for example are trying to find ways to get people to play the MMO for longer and longer and longer right like you Want that lifetime customer like you want people to play your MMO for a decade and charge them their 15 bucks a month And so game developers are actively trying to make the games more addictive So I think that you know if you look at some of these Online like arena games right like fortnight and stuff like that what you actually find is really interesting I was trying to like figure out why kids like playing these games so much and I think what they've done that makes it really interesting is they've affected the rate of Encounters right so they do this very very well so they make it so that you can never relax in a game of fortnight because you never know when you're gonna encounter someone and They shrink the arena so that like you know once the player count kind of dies down Every few minutes you're gonna run into someone so you need to be constantly Paying attention to the arena like you have to always be like paying attention But it never gets to the point where there's like a constant. It's not actually constant It's like a random encounter right so like on in a six minute period you may encounter Three people in the first two minutes or you may encounter one person at one minute and one person at five minutes so they've done a really really good job of like engineering the situation that is very addictive for the brain and keeps people really really excited to play because you can never really relax and Encounters are not so common that they become like boring right so if you think about like grinding mobs in an MMO like There's a lot of like stability to that Whereas in some of these online like battle arenas like what you essentially wind up with is like this kind of really interesting Random encounter schedule which is consistent enough to where you can never relax and that's actually very addictive for your brain and I'm seeing like growing amounts of dangerous unrest within parents And I think that a video game developers are not careful and they continue to make more and more addictive games Which I think they're gonna do what we're gonna wind up with is like a cigarette kind of situation where the negative impact of games Is so profound that you're gonna have governments like China It's gonna start with China, but it'll happen elsewhere to mark my words You're gonna have parent groups that rise up and will be like calling their congressmen and stuff and saying like we want you to ban this kind of game as the addictive potential of games grows What's gonna happen is more gamers are gonna get addicted and more people are gonna start to think it's a problem and then what will probably happen is people will come down hard on the gaming industry and The gaming industry may fight sort of like the you know, the tobacco industry did in terms of saying Oh, no, they're not addictive and stuff like that And they'll even find people like myself who will say like hey, there are positive effects of video games They'll find people like myself who will say hey like, you know find the root causes because I actually believe that stuff I do think games are addictive and I believe that they're if you really want to conquer addiction. It's not about restricting the substance It's about protecting, you know the underlined lying psychological drivers, right? That's true. Do we have to address? But I think if we see this trend we're gonna see this a lot more because as games get more addictive and as more lives get ruined like governments parents and societies like won't stand for it and I think that you know, I don't know how this is gonna affect, you know Tencent's Tencent is a major video game developer in or publisher or whatever company in China So I don't know how it's gonna affect their bottom line I saw you know one figure that said that like, you know Their income comes from 3% of their income comes from miners and 97% comes from non-miners So it may not affect their bottom line, but I think it's like it's just the beginning And so if we're not careful like as an industry as a whole and we do not support the mental health of our of gamers Like you're gonna see more regulations like this and parents are gonna come out and they're gonna see like lawsuits You see all kinds of crap You're gonna see like congressional hearings. You're gonna see it all and So I think you can the last thing that I'll share with you guys is just a page from like Darwinian evolution so, you know a lot of the The bacteria in our gut at one point of infected us, right? So, I don't know if you guys know this but we have for every one human cell you have in your body you have ten Bacterial cells so you have ten times as many bacterial cells in your body as you do human cells and so essentially what happens is that when When when you have an infectious agent if you want to survive what you need to do is become symbiotic And what that means is that you have to deliver enough value to the organism To where the organism doesn't try to kill you it actually like is happy with you hanging out because you bring something to the table And I think the video game industry and games in general at or at a really crucial tipping point So games do do good things. They like they were they were somewhat they helped us somewhat be resilient during things like the pandemic You know people like my wife who like aren't gamers like had trouble with social interactions where I was like, I'm gonna play Dota Like that's what I did before the pandemic. So what I'm doing during the pandemic can actually help a lot But if the gaming industry is not careful what and we continue to make more addictive games and more damaging games Games that bankrupt your player base What you're gonna actually get is a situation where like you're gonna get a Darwinian response and then like people are gonna say hey These things actually hurt us more than help us and then you'll start to fight against it Whereas I think really the direction that we should move in because I love video games is to become more symbiotic Right to like have video games be like a healthy part of your life but not an unhealthy part of your life for video games to be a way that you can interact with people and like form connections with like people and have those connections be real have ways to find support and at the same time like All of those positives like being balanced by you know, just the right amount of engagement And if we don't like in the next five to ten years, I think we're gonna see a lot more legislation like this I don't usually make predictions chat, but I mean I'm seeing it We're gonna see a lot more parents getting really really upset and then like, you know Once the Facebook moms start going to town on something like it can get bad real fast so You know, I'm not surprised that China passed the legislation I think it's like a signal of things to come if the industry continues moving in in the direction that it is and at the same Time I think that the legislation is sort of like addressing a small part of what I view to be like a much bigger problem
