 So if you're in a relationship with someone like this, you start to do the heavy lifting as an adaptation to survive, right? Oh, my partner lost their job. I'm going to work two full-time jobs because I have to adapt to my circumstances. And over time, that becomes a maladaptation because the more lifting that you do, the less lifting they have to do. So then like when they start working again, are you quitting your other job or do they just start to rely on you more and more and more? Like what's going on here? So you can do all of the right things in the moment and still end up in the wrong place. And if you're having trouble with, if you're dating someone who suffers from depression, I think you should absolutely be compassionate. You should absolutely be understanding. I think you should absolutely try to do the heavy lifting when their times are down. And also, they should be responsible for what comes tomorrow. They should do everything within their power, whether they're feeling good or not feeling good, to prevent the next depressive episode.
