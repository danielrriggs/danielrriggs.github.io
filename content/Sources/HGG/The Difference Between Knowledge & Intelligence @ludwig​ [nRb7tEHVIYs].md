 I feel like I know so little. That's why maybe I feel like I'm dumb. But knowledge and intelligence are two different things. Yeah, people always say that. I know it's like a classic saying, I don't really know the difference between the two. That's what makes you dumb. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry guys, I'm memeing. No, that's good. There, he got me there, got me there, got me there. Thank you, doc, thank you, doc. Sorry, I couldn't, is that okay to do it? That's great. When you see the opportunity, you got to strike. You get one chance. There's a difference between intelligence and being smart, or knowledge and being smart. People always like, knowledge is like what you know. And I guess smart is like maybe how you navigate certain situations or whatever, and like your ability to critically think. Yeah, so that's a really good point, that the more you learn, the more your critical thinking is improved.
