 Communicate what your standards are. Communicate what your expectations are. Also, like not all at once and right up front, right? I need you to be this, I need you to be this, I need you to be this, I need you to be this. So stop doing that, right? So start to communicate your expectations. Recognize that your expectations is not a job application where like people are checking off boxes so that they have the privilege of being your mate.
