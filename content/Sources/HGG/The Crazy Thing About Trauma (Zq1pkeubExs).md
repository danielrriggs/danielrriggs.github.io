 The real crazy thing about trauma is that trauma is not really a malfunction of the brain. It is an adaptation. It's the adaptive circuitry of the brain functioning properly. So when we get traumatized when we're young, our brain learns a certain set of rules for life. It learns certain coping mechanisms to survive. And since those are the coping mechanisms that allow you to survive, so for example, dissociation is a good example, where anytime we feel negative emotion, we suppress that negative emotion. And if we feel a ton of negative emotion all the time or physical pain, we will actually dissociate. We unplug our subjective ability to feel things from like all of these pain receptors in our body. We like unplug, we detach ourselves from our body and our mind. And so now the brain has learned how to do that. And that's not, it's not pathology. It's an adaptation.
