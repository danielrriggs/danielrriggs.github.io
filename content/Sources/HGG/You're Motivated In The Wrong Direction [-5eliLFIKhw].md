 The problem isn't that you're not motivated enough. The problem is that you are too motivated in the wrong direction. So let's take the case of you sitting at home and doing nothing. As you try to go and do something, there are very powerful forces for you to overcome for you to do something, right? You really have to try hard to extract yourself from the computer. You have to really try extra hard to go to this extra study session or go to office hours. So if we really look at it, doing things in life requires extra effort. And now you may think that's because I'm not motivated, but if you really pause and think about it, you're highly motivated to continue doing what you're doing. There's a part of your brain that is telling you, hey, we don't wanna do that. We actually really wanna stay here and watch one more episode of whatever we happen to be binging at the time. Or as you struggle to find the motivation to stop using social media, there's a part of your brain that's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, my friend. We're not gonna stop. We're actually highly motivated to continue doing what we're doing.
