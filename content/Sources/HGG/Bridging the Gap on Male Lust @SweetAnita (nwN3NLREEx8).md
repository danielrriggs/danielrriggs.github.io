 The way that I've bridged the gap for my male friends who don't quite understand and don't empathize with me is I go stop imagining loads of women doing this to you. Imagine men doing this to you. Imagine going into a prison and having to work there and all the men there, maybe most of them weren't done for rape or anything sexual, but you don't know which ones have been done for something sexual. And they're all looking you up and down and licking their lips and wolf whistling at you and going, come on, sweetheart, come closer to the bars. I won't bite. And you have to endure that every single day and work around them and not know what's going to happen to you. That's what we're experiencing. You were imagining loads of women fawning over you, complimenting you, being desperate to sleep with you. No, we're dealing with the prison scenario. That's imagine that and then they get it. Then it clicks. If they deal if they imagine having to deal with male lust, they suddenly understand the discomfort so much better.
