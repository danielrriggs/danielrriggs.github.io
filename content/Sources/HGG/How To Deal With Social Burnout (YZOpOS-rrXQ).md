 the situations that cause you to burn out. What are things that you can do to develop habits in those situations instead of exert willpower? And the more that you can do that, the less burnt out you will be. Just to give one example, so I've worked with a ton of people who forget names. So they'll introduce themselves and they'll forget names in social situations, which makes socialization hard. So just simply practicing, I'm going to repeat the name three times, or I'm going to use the name in my response to them. Works wonders. Like, you know, you'll introduce yourself as Michelle, I'll say, Hi, I'm all open. And I'll say, it's nice to meet you, Michelle. And so when you practice some of these habits, and you engage that habit circuitry, it removes the load because habits are automatic. And then that sort of increases the battery that you've got for other things and really helps with the burnout.
