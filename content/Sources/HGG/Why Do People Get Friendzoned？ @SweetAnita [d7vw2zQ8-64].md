 And even then, a lot of people will think that they've been moved into the friend zone. I have been friend zoned, right? You didn't spawn in the friend zone. You zoned in. Interestingly enough, for a lot of people who have been chronically friend zoned, the way that I've seen them get better, and we've seen this actually a lot, is just in terms of letting go of that resentment. Like, it has nothing to do with the outside world. It really has to do with what you carry. And this is one of my big complaints about a lot of the perspectives that we'll see kind of in the Manosphere, is that their experience of the world is influenced by their actions. So if I get friend zoned all the time, that there's something I'm doing. So the most common thing is a fear of rejection that precludes people from making their intentions know early. And so then they fall into this thing where I'm afraid you're going to reject me, so I'm going to do nice things so you like me. And I'm going to stack the deck in my favor until I demonstrate to you that I'm so nice, and then when I shoot my shot, I'm going to have a 99% chance of success.
