 So the problem with instant gratification, the problem with instant gratification is not in the gratification. It's the price that you pay for the gratification. So I'm an addiction psychiatrist. So like I'll talk to people about using heroin and I talk to them and I'm like, this was before I understood addiction psychiatry. I'd be like, I don't understand. Heroin is ruining your life. You're like on probation at work. Wife is divorcing you. Your kids hate you. Mortgage your house. You took a second mortgage out on your house in secret and you spent it on heroin. It's ruining every part of your life. He's like, bro, you don't understand. The moment I use heroin, all of the things that are falling apart in my life go away. That's what fixes the problem. It doesn't create the problem because while I'm high, I don't care that my wife is divorcing me. I don't care that I'm heavily in debt. I don't care that my kids, it's the only thing that makes me feel good. Right? So instant gratification, that bliss that we can create chemically is a wonderful thing. If it wasn't a wonderful thing, we wouldn't have addicts. The problem is when you describe instant to it, it's the price that we're willing to pay for transient states of happiness.
