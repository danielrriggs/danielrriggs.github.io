 Why do we compare things? We compare things because we ourselves are insecure about them. That's why we compare, right? And you may say, what do you mean by that? Let's just understand that for a second. If you're secure about something, you don't notice it in other people. It's kind of weird, but it's like so simple. And it's so automatic that we don't even realize it, that all of our comparisons are based on insecurities. And so now we can see that, okay, the root of envy is actually ego and ego is a defense mechanism against insecurity. So when do I feel egotistical? When someone threatens my intelligence and I'm afraid that maybe I'm not quite as smart as I think I am, and you can look at social media and certain famous people and you just can trigger them very easily. You know, people who are confident, it's like, doesn't really bother them to be criticized. But when we have an insecurity, that's how kids learn how to make fun of you, right? Like they learn where the weak points are. And why do particular kids make fun in a particular way? It's because they sniff out the insecurity. How do they sniff out the insecurity? Because of the way that you react.
