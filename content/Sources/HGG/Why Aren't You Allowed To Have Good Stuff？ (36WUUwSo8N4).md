 This idea that you're not allowed to have good stuff, where did you learn that? That's tough. My brother is, we used to play Diablo and we had like, the whole point of Diablo is to have good items. And then one time he kind of like let me use his account so I could like do duels or whatever. And I was like, oh my God, I kind of, I feel like I had that. I had this now, even though it's not mine, I could kind of use it a little bit. And then some guys like, yo dude, I'll do, I'll dupe your items. Like I'll double it, you know? And I'm like, ooh, Nick is going to love this. I'm going to clutch up and I give him all my items and he just disconnects, you know? And then he comes home from school and he's like, yo dude, what happened? We got hacked. I'm like, oh my God, we got hacked. No. And I never told him. I'm pretty sure he didn't do this, he doesn't know about it. Just small stuff like that. It makes me feel like it doesn't matter like how easy I get it, how hard I work for something that I'll have. I will throw it away one way or another, unintentionally. And that belief becomes so strong that like, okay, I will do it intentionally now.
