 We think about negative emotions as bad things because they're so powerful, right? Fear and anxiety are so crippling. I can't even leave the house because I'm anxious. But what we don't realize is we frequently will manipulate ourselves into harnessing negative emotions for our benefit, right? So we'll tell people, oh yeah, I'm going to go to the gym because if I don't go, then I'll feel guilty. So we've figured out how to trick ourselves into doing what we want to do, harnessing negative emotions. And it works. So I'm not saying don't abandon it. What I'm saying is that it's not a good long-term solution because then ultimately what you're going to end up doing is it's like, your productivity is tied to suffering and that's unhealthy. Is it going to lead to success? Sure, but it's unhealthy. And the key thing is that there's another way, but we never explore that way because this one is so good. Why does everyone procrastinate? It's not because procrastination is a problem. It's because it's a solution.
