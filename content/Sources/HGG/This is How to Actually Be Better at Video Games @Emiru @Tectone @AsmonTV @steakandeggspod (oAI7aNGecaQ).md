 Everything that we know about how to study efficiently also works for playing games. So I'll ask you all a couple questions. Do you do better the first time you fight a boss compared to the second through fifth time? The first time every single time. Yeah. Every single time, right? This is like a common pattern. So this means that there's something like, we do really well. Like you get the boss down to 20% health and then you wipe. And the second time you go in and you get like two-shotted, right? Yeah. That's what happens. The science, the performance, and all the stuff around learning. I did this with Elden Ring. I actually like applied this because I didn't have four hours of grind. So what I would do is I'd play a boss for like maybe like 20 to 40 minutes. And then I'd take a break. And then what happens, especially when you sleep, is all of your learning that happens in short-term memory actually consolidates into long-term memory. And so even when I was playing Radon and stuff, not Radon, Radigan, right? So what I would do is like, I'd play for like half an hour every morning. And then like in four or five days, I beat it. It was easy. So if you play for five hours at a stretch, you're going to lose. Okay. All right. So that's like an actual good way of handling it. All right. That is amazing.
