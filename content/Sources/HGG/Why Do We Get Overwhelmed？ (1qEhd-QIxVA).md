 So the feeling of being overwhelmed comes from a relationship between passive challenges and active challenges. Now what does that mean? So a passive challenge is something that you were challenged with that you did not choose. So when life throws you difficulties, those are passive challenges. And oftentimes, this is what makes us feel overwhelmed, because there are too many things that are outside of our control. And when life is sending us a bunch of stuff that are outside of our control, we can't fix them. If we can't fix them, we feel overwhelmed. There's another kind of challenge, though, which is something called an active challenge. And an active challenge is a challenge that you choose to take. So if you set a goal for yourself and you decide to move towards it, that's an active challenge. Is it difficult? Yes. But you are choosing the difficulty. Your mind feels overwhelmed when your passive challenges outweigh your active challenges.
