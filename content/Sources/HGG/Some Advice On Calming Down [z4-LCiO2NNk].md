 If you're feeling upset about something, the one thing I would encourage you to do, do some kind of rote activity for 15 minutes before you pick up your phone. Go for a walk, go gardening, fold laundry, do something stupid with your hands for about 15 minutes. If you want to do needlework, do needlework. Literally, this is stuff that they do like I worked in an inpatient hospital where on day one when you're checking in, we take away all of your shoelaces so you don't hang yourself and we hand you needlework, right? But like that's literally what we would do. We also check you for razor blades and here's a blunt needle. Anyway, so what you want to do is do some like let your mind emotionally process for a little bit, okay?
