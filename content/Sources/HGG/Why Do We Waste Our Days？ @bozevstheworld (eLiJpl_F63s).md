 If all I do is play video games all day, what's the value of a day? The value of a day is low. And so what is the cost of me wasting a day? What can I accomplish in that day? Anyway, can't accomplish much. So what's the harm in wasting it? And this is the trap that people create is since my day is not worth much, because I don't do much with it, I can afford to waste it. And the more days that you waste, the less valuable they become, the less valuable they become, the less it hurts to waste them. And what I'm really seeing from you, and I think you've really put it well, is that a day is worth more to you. And people think that, oh, this is because I'm older and now the sand in the hourglass. No, it's just, you've really learned how valuable of a human being you are. And this is where the self-esteem comes in. Because when you learn that you're a valuable person, then your time is worth more. If it is time is worth more, it is not worth wasting. If it's not worth wasting, then I'm going to live life to the fullest.
