 If you start to think of your personality as identity, then that is cringe. So let's understand this. Let's say that you are really good with people. It's wonderful. You're extroverted. You're charismatic. The moment that you think if you want to understand what cringe is, you can take someone who's very charismatic. What makes them cringe? Identifying as charismatic. I'm the most charismatic person in the world. Look at me. I'm so charismatic. I'm so sexy. You want me. You need me. Uh huh. That becomes cringe. Let's say I'm sad and I'm depressed. This is something that deserves compassion. It deserves help. It deserves support. It doesn't make you weak or anything like that. Sometimes depression happens to people. So be it. Some people make it their identity. I've had them as patients. That becomes cringe. I am depressed. I am depressed. I can never get better. I can never get better. I can never get better. I think we should give them compassion and stuff, right? That's what we do. You're gonna love video games. I'm a gamer. Those aren't real games. A real gamer plays these games. That's cringe. So the moment that personality becomes identity, we've entered the realm of cringe.
