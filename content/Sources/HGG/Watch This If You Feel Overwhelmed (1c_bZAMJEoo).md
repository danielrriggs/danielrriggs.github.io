 So we know, for example, that breath has a reciprocal relationship with emotion. When I start feeling a particular way, I will start breathing a particular way. So if I like start breathing like this, what do you all think I'm feeling right now? And on the flip side, I can start breathing like this. And if you start hyperventilating, hyperventilate with me for a second, you start to feel like really uncomfortable, right? But you can induce that discomfort with your breath. And the flip side of it is also true, that if you take a long, deep breath, and what we really want to do is focus on long exhalations. If you change your breath, the emotions will change with it. So if you're feeling overwhelmed, you can even see, pay attention to my voice, right? I can feel myself calming down with a single breath. My voice is changing, my tone is changing, and it's literally that simple. The more you practice it, the better you'll be.
