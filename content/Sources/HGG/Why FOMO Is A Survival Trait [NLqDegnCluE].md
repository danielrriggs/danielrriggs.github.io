 The other primitive part that FOMO sort of accesses is this desire not to be ostracized. So the world has changed a lot, but our brain did not evolve for the world that we live in today. So as an example, you know, in the past, we lived in like communities of maybe 200 or 300 humans. These were like tribal communities or even smaller packs. We're talking about like for millions of years, this is what humans used to do. And so if you sort of think about the price of being left out or the price of ostracization, it was really, really severe, right? If you kind of fall out with your tribe, it's not like you can just meet new people on the internet today. You can't just block one person and then find a new person tomorrow. You can now, but you didn't used to be able to. So what happens is our brain sort of realized that, okay, being ostracized from the pack, like a wolf that gets ostracized from the pack, is basically gonna die.
