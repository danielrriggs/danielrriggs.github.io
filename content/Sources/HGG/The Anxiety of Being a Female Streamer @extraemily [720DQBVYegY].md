Uh, I think as a female streamer, I definitely do Uh, I just I guess it's like maybe I just put in my mind But I feel like 32 is might be like the peak for me, but I don't know It's just like uh based off streamers that exist now So I know there are a lot of like really successful female streamers, uh 32 and older So i'm like, oh like if they can do it, I feel like I can do it So that's how I kind of get my basis for that number Okay, especially as a woman.
