 One thing I would say is really common amongst gamers though is something that I would call the logical red herring Which is why they fail in therapy gamers will go in they'll have some traumatic event And then they'll have some other event that they have logically deduced is the source of their problems And so they'll come into therapy and they'll say this is my problem and they'll talk about it and talk about it and talk About it and you don't ever get anywhere. You don't get to the big boulder that was behind Exactly. So like what ends up happening is they're like misdirecting It's like some kind of illusion magic I'm going to take my repression and I'm going to like make it a problem and this is what determines my life Oh, I like this happened or this happened And so we end up getting stuck because they keep on pointing all of the therapeutic energy at the wrong thing And the reason they do that is because this hurts and I don't want anyone to know about this So instead what I'm going to do is construct a narrative because I'm so smart that fits what people go to therapy for
