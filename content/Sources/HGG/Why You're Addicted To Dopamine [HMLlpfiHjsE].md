 So the more negative emotion we are dealing with, the more vulnerable we are to dopaminergic signals from the nucleus accumbens. So if you sort of think about it, this kind of makes sense, right? The worse we feel, if I'm feeling depressed, if I'm feeling anxious, I'm more vulnerable to dopaminergic activities. Because what we know is that dopamine basically shuts off negative emotion. And negative emotion induces cravings for dopamine. Because we feel bad when we have negative emotions, right? And if we feel bad when we have negative emotions, how does our brain know how to make ourselves feel better? Ah, that's right, we have this thing called dopamine. And if we release dopamine, we will induce more pleasure. So what do we see in psychiatry? Especially with things like addiction psychiatry. So what we tend to find is that people who are addicted tend to have a lot of negative pent-up emotions. And as long as you have negative pent-up emotions, your vulnerability to dopamine signals will increase.
