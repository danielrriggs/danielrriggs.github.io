 So in our mind, we have an idea of who we can be. But I want you all to notice that we all construct ideal versions of ourselves. And this is especially true, like I've seen this a lot in people who are, you know, like South Asian, East Asian, things like that. Or if you grow up with parents who have a bunch of shoulds, you should do this, you should do this, you should do this. And so we have this sense of an ideal self. And then there's the real us over here. If this gap exists and this identity over here exists and based on all the things that you should do, if you ever reach that, are you going to feel accomplished? Probably not. You think you are. Who feels accomplished? If my parents say, oh, Alok, you're a doctor, you should become a doctor one day. That's so good. You're going to be so smart. And I become a doctor one day. Who feels accomplished? Do I feel accomplished? No, because it wasn't my goal to begin with. Who feels accomplished is my parents, who brag to everyone that I became a doctor.
