 The more motivated you are, the harder it is to make a choice. Because if we think about what is motivation, I'm motivated, I'm driven. So if you sort of think about it, who's in control when you're highly motivated? I've worked with CEOs who are so motivated to work really hard, they've gotten married and divorced three separate times. I've literally had to take patients who had eating disorders, who were so motivated to avoid food that they had to be strapped into a hospital bed and hooked up with IVs so they don't have heart arrhythmias and die. This is the power of motivation. But when we get highly motivated, we lose all control. So the crazy thing is that as you move away from motivation, what you start to get in return is choice. And now I want you all to think back to a time where you just had a good day, where you woke up in the morning and you weren't particularly motivated. We're talking about truly content. And then you can kind of do whatever you want to that day.
