 Today when you fail, the reason you're demoralized and you give up is not because you failed today, it's because you add the energy of all of your previous failures onto this failure. This is why it's overwhelming to deal with. It's not just this failure. You're not looking at it in isolation. They do it once and then they fail again and they fail a third time. And then what happens now? I've failed three times in a row. You stack them all together without processing each one. And then the fourth failure, you're not dealing with one failure. You're trying to manage four failures. This is how you get these kind of patterns of people who are like, I've tried everything and nothing works. Failure after failure after failure stacks up, changes the way that your mind thinks, and then you start engaging something called the nocebo effect, which is the opposite of placebo. So placebo is- Can you explain that term? So placebo is if we think something is going to work, it works. And nocebo is if we think something isn't going to work, it doesn't work. Very simple.
