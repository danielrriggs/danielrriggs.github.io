 The reason that people struggle with follow through and really give up and can't really become awesome is because they have the wrong reasons. If you wanna be good at something, you have to have scientifically the right reason. And we know from a ton of research that certain reasons lead to consistent positive behavior. Now this starts with a sort of a problem with the word reason, because reason is not one thing, it's not a reason. Reason's actually your discrete things in your brain. So the first kind of reason is a desire. So a desire is an impulse that you wanna satisfy, okay? So desires are born of the sensory organs. The second thing is that desires are kind of like a lose lose situation. Because if you do something and you satisfy the desire, desire is the driving force and you satisfy the desire, then the motivation is gonna disappear because you're done, you're done, right? And that's what we've got to be super careful about is that desires are actually like, even as we fulfill them, which means as we make progress, our motivation actually decays and we end up not becoming awesome because we kind of give up, because we're sort of done.
