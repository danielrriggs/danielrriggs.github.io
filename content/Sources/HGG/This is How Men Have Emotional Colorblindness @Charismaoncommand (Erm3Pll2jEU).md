 There's this concept called alexithymia, which is color blindness of your internal emotional state. So a lot of men like literally don't know what emotions they're feeling. What they're feeling, yeah. So we're familiar with frustration and everything pisses us off. Like if I'm ashamed of myself, I'm pissed off. If I feel rejected by someone unloved, I'm going to be pissed at them. You know, if I'm anxious about something, I'm going to lash out at that person and try to be like controlling towards them. And so one of the really interesting things is that there's a term normative male alexithymia. What some psychologists have discovered is that it's normal for men to not understand their internal emotional state. What we do understand is like the feelings in our body. So the window to understanding your emotions as a man is oftentimes actually using your body, understanding what am I feeling physically right now? Then you can ask people like, OK, if you've got a lump in your throat, like what emotion do you think that could be? And then they're like, I don't know, maybe fear. And that's like that argue. You're feeling afraid. They're like, wow, yeah, I'm feeling afraid. I feel like that's fear. Oh, crap. I never knew that.
