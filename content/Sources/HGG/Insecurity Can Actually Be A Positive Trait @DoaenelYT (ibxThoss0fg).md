 Do you want to be less insecure? I don't know. Because so the problem is that my insecurity is part of the reason why I feel like I have to grind as hard as I do. Yeah. And the issue is that if I lose that insecurity, then would I also lose that fire that forces me to push myself? So that's why it's one of those things where finding out how I would be able to be more insecure or less insecure would be good for me. So I could unlock it later down the line. But as things are right now with everything going as well as it is for like my career and things like that, it's almost like I would rather keep that trade because it is like pretty essential for why I even got to where I am to begin with. Yeah. I've never heard about anyone unlocking insecurity is like a positive talent trait or something like that, you know? Yeah, well, I mean, it's like the video game thing, right? Where it's like you unlock the tree, but then let's say you need to spend 300 gold to actually use it. Well, I'll just spend that 200 gold like two years from now, right? At least having that option will always be there.
