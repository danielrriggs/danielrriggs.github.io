 So if you really look at the science of burnout, what you find is it is relational. It is a connection between a person and a workplace. My boss texts me at 10 o'clock at night and asks me for stuff. This is burning me out. Then we ask our client, what do you do when they text you? Do you set limits with them? And do you say, hey, it's after hours, I'm happy to get to it first thing tomorrow morning? No, I don't say that. Why don't you say that? Because I'm conflict avoidant and I'm afraid of what they're going to think of me and I want to be seen as a team player. So you never, and then how is your boss supposed to know that you're bothered by this? Because some people aren't. So the reason we learned this stuff is we started working with creators and we realized burnout is a huge problem. It's not depression, it's not anxiety. But what we realized that there are some internal things, some internal vulnerabilities, which will intersect with a particular environment, whether it's content creation or a corporate job or even a family. And this is what leads to burnout.
