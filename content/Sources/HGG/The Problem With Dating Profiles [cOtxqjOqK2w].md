 So dating profiles are restricted with the kind of information that you can put. And do dating profiles capture the actual variables that lead to successful relationships? No, they don't. There's all kinds of variables that lead to successful relationships, like shared emotional experience the first time you meet. You can't put that on a dating app. Everyone assumes that it's different, there's a shared religion and everybody who wants like, I want to be a sugar daddy or I want to be a sugar baby and somebody else wants to be a sugar mama and like as long as the baby's and the mama's and the daddy's all get together everybody's happy. That's not actually what leads to relationships. So the first thing is when we have low self-esteem, when we think that oh my god this is like I'm not good at this, the biggest mistake that we make is we remove all the people that are too good for us. And then we're left with all the people who are a little bit busted. And then no wonder we have negative experiences, right? Because you're selecting the one person that feels safe to you, which is someone who is unable to have a healthy relationship.
