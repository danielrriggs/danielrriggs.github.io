 So when you use the internet, are you having fun? So I don't know if you guys caught that part, but I still don't understand why this happens. So far people have been raising our hands. But when I asked that question, I was like, ahhhhhh. Do you all see that? So that is actually, I don't even know what that is, but ahhhhhh. Actually captures our experience of using the internet. You all get that? Like you guys did it beautifully. That was a limbic response. So some part of your brain is like, I don't know how to answer that question. But for some reason, like 150 of you all, at the same moment, your brain did the same damn thing. Which is, ahhhhhh. So that's not dopamine. You all get that? So this is something that I don't think a lot of people understand. Dopamine is not actually the reason we use the internet. The reason that we use the internet is because it's emotionally engaging.
