 is that the function of the ego is to protect the mind. So generally speaking, the ego activates when we are in a negative emotional state. So it tries to protect us. Our mind is like, oh my God, we're feeling bad. And the ego is like, let me help you with that by putting other people down or pumping myself up. So this person was mean to us. Let's talk crap about their behind their back and tell everyone how there's such a mean person. And the more that we throw shade on that person, the less it hurts us that this person said something mean about us. So the classic example is person A asks person B out, person B says no, person A feels rejected and starts saying stuff like, oh, I wasn't that into them. I dodged a bullet. They start telling themselves all kinds of things to help them feel better, to get rid of the rejection. Because the more you convince yourself that you dodged a bullet, then you're not rejected, right? You dodged, it was a win. They turned you down. Wow, look at how lucky I was. Copium, well said. So the ego is the master of copium.
