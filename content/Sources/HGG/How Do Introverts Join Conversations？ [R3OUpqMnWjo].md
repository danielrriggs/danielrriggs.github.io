 So here's the other cool thing about when you do something like this. A lot of people who are antisocial are worried about how to get into the conversation, right? So they're like, people are talking back and forth and you're like, how do I butt in? The cool thing is when you start a conversation, you can shut up for the rest of it and everyone will perceive you as a part of the conversation because you got the ball rolling. You're like running the show. You're like at the head of the table. It's super cool. If you like being quiet and you don't know how to butt into conversations, what you should do is start the conversation because then it's checkmark. We're done. It's awesome. I love it as an introvert who doesn't like talking.
