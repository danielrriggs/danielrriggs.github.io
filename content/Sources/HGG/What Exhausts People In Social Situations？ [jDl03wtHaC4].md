 What exhausts people in social situations is also something like social anxiety. So if we look at social anxiety, which an extrovert can have, by the way, which is terrifying, it's really tricky. What happens is that when we go into social situations, when we have social anxiety, our cognitive ram is filled up with anxious thoughts. So you go and you hang out with a group of friends and you're like, oh my god, like, what is this person thinking? Is this person upset? Should I speak in? When should I enter the conversation? I have something cool to say, but I don't know how to enter the conversation. I'm just waiting here, waiting for my chance to speak, waiting for my chance to speak. And oh crap, now they've shifted to something else, but I had really something cool to say. Should I go back to the topic? But that feels kind of awkward and I kind of miss my chance. And oh crap. And like now I'm not even saying anything. And are people wondering, like, if I'm just standing around, am I being creep? This is what leads to social exhaustion. This is social anxiety.
