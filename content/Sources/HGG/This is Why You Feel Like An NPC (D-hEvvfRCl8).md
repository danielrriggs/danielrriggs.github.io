 Sometimes in life, we sort of feel like we're an NPC. We're not living our lives as player characters, right? So a player character decides what they're gonna do. They're gonna be pursuing main quests. They're going to be going here and going there, and there's some degree of advancement. But some of us feel like we're NPCs. And what we're sort of doing is we're just existing in our little corner of the world, and we're not even saying anything or doing anything until someone else comes along. And when they interact with us, when they right-click us, that's when we start to go through this dialogue and we become active. And this is exactly what happens in this trauma response, because you can't live a life with intention. You're living life very reactively, and it requires external stimuli to motivate you to action. So if you're someone who's sort of living life as an NPC, it may not be due to lack of willpower or discipline. It may simply be due to this sort of stealth and very common trauma response that affects up to 50% of people.
