 So if we want to understand our own emotions and how to be able to open up, we've got to kind of start small and kind of meet ourselves where we're at. So I'd start by even asking yourself something simple like, do you, you know, are you experiencing a positive emotion or a negative emotion? What's the color of the negative emotion? Is it angry? Is it frustration? Is it shame? Is it fear? Is it sadness? Is it worry?
