 If you want to learn how to eat healthy and stop eating crap, all you need to do is understand where hunger comes from. Hunger comes from two places. Comes from the mind, comes from the body. When hunger comes from the body, pretty much any food will satisfy it. When hunger comes from the mind, only specific things will satisfy it. When you learn how to tell the difference between hunger in the body and hunger in the mind, then there's a very simple way to eat healthy, which is listen to the hunger in your body, not the hunger in your mind. If you want to understand how to get a clue into this relationship, excellent thing to do is to exercise and pay attention to thirst and see what satisfies thirst. The thirst that you feel after you exercise is a bodily thirst. The thirst that you feel when you watch me stream is a mental thirst. Who am I kidding? That one's bodily thirst too.
