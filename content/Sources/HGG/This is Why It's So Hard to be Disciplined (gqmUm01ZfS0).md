 So if you're not ready to get disciplined, it's never going to work as long as you're developing the discipline for someone else. And some of y'all may have even grown up in situations where your parents were very controlling, right? And they tried to instill discipline. But if someone is forcing you to study or forcing you to work or forcing you to do anything, that's not actually discipline. It's actually the exact opposite, because these are external forces that are controlling your behavior. The point of discipline is that it's an internal force that overcomes your barriers. And so this can be really confusing for a lot of people, because even if they've been pressured and they've been successful, they can sometimes have no discipline at all. And any time they're left to kind of self-start, they struggle with it.
