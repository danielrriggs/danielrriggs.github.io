 And this is why it's so hard. Because achieving perfection starts with letting perfection go. We don't want to though. Because if we let it go, then there's no guarantee. And that's a big part of grief. When a relationship ends, I want to hold on to that relationship. Why do I want to hold on to that relationship? Because there's no guarantee that I'll meet someone in the future. So a big part of that grief process is embracing the uncertainty. So if you struggle with perfectionism and feel overwhelmed because you know you can do it and you don't want to settle, but you actually need to do is grieve. It's not settling. It's letting go of that perfection. And paradoxically, as you let go of the perfection, you actually take a step closer to it.
