 The basic problem with half of y'all is that y'all go the extra 10 miles for a relationship when that person is not even willing to go a single mile for you. And sometimes we mean physically. I've seen people in romantic relationships where one person always does the hour-long drive there and the hour-long drive back. And the other person can't be bothered because I have so much to do that you need to spend two hours driving to come and see me. So the short answer is if you're in a relationship don't go the extra mile. Just go the mile that you're supposed to go and let them meet you halfway. That's how you break out of this pattern.
