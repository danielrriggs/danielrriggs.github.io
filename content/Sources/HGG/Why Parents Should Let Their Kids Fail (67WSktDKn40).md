 teaching the parents how to let their kids fail is one of the most important things that we offer. And it's hard. Believe me, it's hard. Because if he gets the C, oh my goodness, he's not going to get to Harvard or Yale. Oh my goodness, his future is destroyed. We will not be able to find a good girl. I want to have Ivy League daughter-in-law educated, but not too educated. Son must be more educated. Right? So you can't let your kid fail because then that has consequences. So then you protect your kid from the consequences. You don't let them damage their own life. And in doing so, you infantilize them. And then you accept responsibility for their situation, even though you don't have the power to control their situation. Suddenly, their grades are your fault, but you can't do the studying. Boy, have no doubt in my mind that there's a handful of Indian parents out there that would take the test for their kids if they could. And then you have a man child.
