 There are three types of perfectionism. There's internally, I wanna be perfect and I'm holding myself to my internal standard. There is sort of like an external perfectionism where I wanna be perfect for someone else. Maybe that's a better way to put it. You can wanna be perfect for yourself. You can wanna be perfect for someone else. And there's a third type of perfectionism, which is society expects me to be perfect and I cannot be. So this is not a particular person. This is not like I'm doing this to make mommy or daddy happy. This is fundamentally believing that what society expects of me, I cannot achieve and I'm just not good enough. That is the subgroup of perfectionism that has gone up by almost 50%. So what's happening is, and this was back in like 2015, so something is going on where society is expecting us to be something and more and more and more people are believing that they cannot achieve it. Does social media have something to do with it? Certainly. Because what's happening is social media paints you a picture of what your life should be, even though no one's life is actually like that.
