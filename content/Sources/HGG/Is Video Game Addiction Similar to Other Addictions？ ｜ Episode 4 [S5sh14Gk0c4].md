 It's not the same way with video games. So I loved to play video games earlier and I still play video games now. I don't think necessarily that video games are inherently evil. It doesn't mean that they aren't being designed to be more addictive. It doesn't mean that the problems they're creating are getting to be more and more worse. But I don't think it's like a biological addiction.
