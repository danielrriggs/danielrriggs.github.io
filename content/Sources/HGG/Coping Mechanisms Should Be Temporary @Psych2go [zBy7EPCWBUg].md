 What are some coping strategies that you recommend for those struggling with depression and anxiety? It's a great question. So I'm laughing a lot because I think that oftentimes people who are struggling with depression and anxiety are actually like experts at coping, right? They're maxed out on their coping skills. I get that you're coping. Yeah, let's do mindfulness so that you can cope more. But honestly, it makes me super sad that like people have to cope so much. I almost want to encourage people to get help because everyone wants to optimize coping strategies, and it's a good thing to do. We know that there's good scientific evidence behind them. But also, like sometimes people will avoid going into treatment because they're like, OK, if I like learn one more coping skill, I'll be able to cope. And when what I really want to tell the people who are listening to this is that I think the one thing to understand is that when you get like really solid in terms of treatment or health with these things, you no longer need to cope. And that's really what the target should be. Coping is a temporary mechanism that should be used temporarily.
