 Emotions can bounce around inside you and be really overwhelming and affect you for a very long period of time unless you deal with them in some way. So sometimes we deal with them by like unhealthy coping mechanisms like playing video games or using drugs. We can also do healthy things like maybe exercise or meditate or journal or whatever. But a really important thing that we can do is talk to other people about our emotions. And when we talk to them, it can help us feel better. But the other cool thing is that we can actually improve our relationships either at work or like friendships or romantic relationships by vocalizing our feelings. The challenge is that most of us are not taught how to vocalize our feelings, how to understand our feelings. So since we're not taught that, when we try to communicate our feelings to other people, they respond in ways that are kind of hurtful. And we kind of feel like this isn't really working, I'm burdening other people, it's not helping at all.
