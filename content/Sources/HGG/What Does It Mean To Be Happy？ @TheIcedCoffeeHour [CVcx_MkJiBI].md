 The whole problem with the world, we chase external things that give us pleasure or dopamine, and we think that those are happiness because no one ever teaches us what happiness truly is. And so we go chasing these things, but the basic problem with an Oreo cookie, your dopamine is temporary. The Oreo goes away, and then you want another Oreo, and then you get more dopamine, and then you need a third Oreo. Now you're developing dopaminergic tolerance. Now you've eaten four Oreos because you need to eat two extra Oreos to get the happiness of the first Oreo. And now you've eaten six Oreos because you're chasing this pleasure of an Oreo, and now you're feeling guilty because you've eaten six Oreos. That's interesting. So I feel like a good guideline would be how do you feel without any stimuli? If you're just sitting by yourself without anything. Good job. Oh, is that okay? You asked me a question at the beginning. What was the first question in the podcast you asked me? Are you happy? And what did I say? You said yes. So what's the answer that you just came up with? What were you saying? Because you're able to feel content and happy, pleasant, positive without any stimuli. Yes.
