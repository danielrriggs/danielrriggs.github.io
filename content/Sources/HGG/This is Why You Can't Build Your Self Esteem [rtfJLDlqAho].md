 You're craving validation. And when someone even tries to give you positive feedback, you're like, what are you not telling me? Or what you'll do is you'll say, yeah, I know the presentation was good, but the only reason it was good is because this person was sick today. And if they were here, they would have done a better presentation. And then I wouldn't even be getting this compliment. The mind virus is a great word. It's a virus that will hijack whatever is happening on the outside world. And then you can never even build your self-esteem because you won't accept the validation. And then the cycle repeats, right? Because now I, oh, I don't feel good about myself. So I need other people to praise me.
