 How does the addictive mind work? So my favorite version of the addictive mind is I can quit anytime I want. Version one of the addictive mind is I can quit anytime I want. And then what we sort of know is that if you're in denial, since I can quit anytime I want, I don't need to quit. I'm in control, therefore I can keep using. That's layer one of the addictive mind. Layer two, this is when things get really tricky. I can quit anytime I want. And I'm aware that if I don't actually demonstrate the control, then I have a problem. So I'm gonna quit for two weeks. And since we're able to quit for two weeks, now we can use every day because now we have proof that we're in control. So there's a subtle layer of the addictive mind that will test you and give you proof that you're in control. And then you may ask yourself the question, well, hold on a second. How do you know that this is really not control, right? How do you decide? And that's where it's tricky. Why did you pick two weeks? Where did that number come from? So the addictive mind will pick the number that it knows that you can accomplish to trick you into thinking that you're in control.
