 This is what's sort of interesting about growing up being Indian. You know, I come from a culture where arranged marriages happen. And the thing about arranged marriages is you don't get to pick the perfect person. You sort of try, your family sort of tries, but there's this attitude of like making the decision work. This is the difference between an indecisive person and a decisive person. It means that the indecisive person tries to pick the right choice and the decisive person makes whatever choice they pick work. It's this idea that whatever you choose, you can kind of make it work. It's what you do after the decision that's really important. And this is precisely why they don't end up sort of in bad places, right? When a decisive person makes a decision, it doesn't look like a mistake. And why doesn't it look like a mistake? Because it's not because they made the right choice. It's because what they did after the choice, that decisiveness actually affects the outcome. The outcome is not dictated by the choice. It's dictated by what you do after you make the choice.
