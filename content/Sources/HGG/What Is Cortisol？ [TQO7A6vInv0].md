 So if we have this hormone called cortisol, cortisol does a couple of interesting things. Increases the inflammation that we experience. It increases our heart rate. It increases our blood pressure. It makes us more mentally stressed. We feel more mentally stressed. And it floods our bloodstream with sugar. Now, since it does all of these different things, each of these things goes back and regulates cortisol. So there's a really interesting set of studies that show that people who've been traumatized have high levels of cortisol. And those high levels of cortisol increase their hypervigilance, make it hard for them to go to sleep. And the cortisol is doing that to your brain. So really cool studies show that eating beta-glucans, which are some of the substances in mushrooms, regulate your blood sugar, will actually go back and reduce your cortisol level. If we can eat stuff that lowers our blood sugar, that will kind of go back and feed back and reduce the cortisol, and then result in a lower blood pressure and lower stress level. This is in the case of someone who's got a high level of cortisol and a history of trauma.
