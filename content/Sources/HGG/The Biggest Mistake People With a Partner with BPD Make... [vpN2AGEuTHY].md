 The biggest mistake that I see a lot of people who have relationships with BPD make is that they hate the lows. So we're totally fine getting rid of the lows, but we don't want to get rid of the highs, right? Like, dude, when a woman tells me that the only thing in life that will fix all the trauma is my dick, that's really addictive because we're men and like we our self-esteem is based on the performance of our penis or So one of the key things that I found working with people with BPD and people who are dating BPD is that you can't give into the highs as well. So if there's something super amazing that you all are about to engage in, you need the same amount of restraint, which is something that in society we never talk about. But the key thing in BPD is that we don't want to be reactive, right? We don't want to follow the yo-yo when it's on its own. We don't ride the roller coaster all the way up because as soon as we go all the way up, there's going to be a plunge, right? So we want to stay as neutral as possible.
