 the best way to achieve goals is to get off of this like rodeo of like emotional satisfaction from external accomplishment. So once you can start to look at your job as simply a goal, right, and you are independent of that, my worth as a human being and how I feel about myself is not tied into this goal, that is when you devote the appropriate amount of effort, then you understand how much effort you need to put in. Does that make sense? Because then it's objective. It's like, okay, it's like to get a 10% promotion, I should put in 10% more work, and this is what I am willing to do, and I'm not going to do more, and I'm not going to do less. This is what I want. This is what I'm willing to spend. And then you're in control of your life, because when you're emotionally tied up into it, your boss is like, yeah, we need more. Well, this person is doing this and this person is doing this. So that means I need to do this. And now you're putting in 50% more effort, 60% more effort, 100% more effort for what kind of gain? 10% gain? Maybe.
