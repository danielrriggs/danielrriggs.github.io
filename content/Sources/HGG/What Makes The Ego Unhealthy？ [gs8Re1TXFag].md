 As you tolerate your negative emotions, as you no longer need to avoid your negative emotions, then the ego will get healthier. Teacher asks a question and I know the answer, but I don't want to look dumb. It is the avoidance of feeling dumb or being embarrassed that causes me to stay quiet. But if I acknowledge that, okay, I may answer wrong, I could feel embarrassed, and that's okay. I can actually handle a little bit of embarrassment. Like I don't need to shape my life to avoid embarrassment at every turn. We're not saying we're going to go out there and do the most embarrassing things all the time, but in this individual instance, it's just a little bit of embarrassment. The teacher will correct me and then tomorrow the embarrassment will be gone. Because the tricky thing is that the more we avoid negative emotions, the more egotistical we become and the more restrictive our life becomes.
