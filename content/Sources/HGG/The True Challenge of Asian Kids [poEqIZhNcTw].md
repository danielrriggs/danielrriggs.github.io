 I'm gonna ask you a little bit about what you want. So what do you want from life? Because the challenge here is that if you're an Asian kid, what you want has been like serially beaten out of you your entire life. Because if you're an Asian American kid, if you're an Asian kid, you grow up in a household and what you want is like the least important thing in the universe. So like if you wanted to learn bass guitar or saxophone, like what are you talking about kid? It's like piano or violin. Like there's the pre-approved things. And so your whole life, what you want has been knocked out of you. And so what do Asian kids do? They rebel in secret ways. Yeah, my parents forced me to be an engineer, but instead of actually studying, because I can't bring myself to study because I actually don't wanna be an engineer, I'm gonna just play League of Legends and sit in my basement all day. I'm gonna skirt by with bees and then my parents are gonna yell at me some and I'm not gonna say anything. I'm gonna clam down. I'm gonna become a shell of my former self. And then once they stop yelling at me, I'm gonna go back to school and I'm gonna try really hard to change my life. And I'm gonna keep playing League of Legends. So you're gonna have your quiet rebellion.
