 When was the last time you had a good cry? And the thing is like we don't talk about having a good cry. Even the men that I worked with especially, they can have a bad cry. They can go into the corner of their house when no one's around and be in isolation and cry. That's hard for a lot of dudes. But the good cry is something that's really hard to find. The good cry is when you're crying, usually someone else is there and then you feel good. We know how to feel bad when we cry as a society, but we've lost the ability for the good cry. That's what happens in therapy, right? Half of therapy is the good cry. It's like the cry and it's like, you know, and we'll… I usually like talk about hugging my patients and stuff. We figure out what the right boundaries are and then we'll have a hug. So I hope you all are able to good cry and give other people around you the chance to good cry. Just ask them, when was the last time you had a good cry? And people will go, what the f*** is wrong with you? You're like, come on in, you know? And give people that chance. It's okay to cry.
