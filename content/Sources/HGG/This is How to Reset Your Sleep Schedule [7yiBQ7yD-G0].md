 So this is what's really bizarre. If you have trouble waking up in the morning, like let's say you have trouble waking up at 7 a.m. Try waking up earlier. Try waking up one hour earlier or two hour earlier. Because what we all assume is that, oh, I will wake up after eight hours of sleep and then it'll be easy for me to wake up. Not necessarily. So sometimes you need to wake up after six hours of sleep or five and a half hours or, you know, wake up two hours earlier. And then you may be tired at the end of the day, but waking up will be easier. And then if you're tired at the end of the day, you can go to sleep and then you still wake up at like 5.30 or 6. So one really interesting technique is if you're having trouble waking up and getting out of bed, you may be waking up in the middle of your sleep cycle. So instead, and this is where oftentimes we can't shift it later, right? So you can wake up naturally if you let it finish. But since we can't do that, what we actually want to do is wake up even earlier and it'll be easier to wake up and you'll feel that more body fatigue as the day goes on, which is actually totally fine. And then you turn in early and then you get a full eight and a half hours of sleep and you wake up at 5.30. So that's how you reset your sleep schedule.
