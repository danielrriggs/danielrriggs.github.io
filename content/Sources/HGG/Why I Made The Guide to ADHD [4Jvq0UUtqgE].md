 So we get a lot of flack because we'll make ADHD videos that are two hours long. And people with ADHD are like, oh my god, I have ADHD, how the hell am I supposed to get through that? And so what we did instead is we made an ADHD guide that's about 20 hours long, and this is about 100 pages worth of script. And I hate to say it, but like ADHD, just because you have ADHD doesn't mean that fixing it can be reduced to 15 minutes. There are a thousand TikToks out there that say, ha ha ha, I have ADHD, or memes that you can look at one image and you're kind of like, oh yeah, that's me. But then what do you do about it? Because the truth of the matter is overcoming ADHD is friggin' hard, and it can't be reduced to like a 15 minute summary. If it was, then no one would have this problem. So as frustrating as it is, if we really want to try to help you, we've got to go into all of this crap. And even if your attention span sucks, we're going to do our best to make it entertaining, and we'll divide it into like 20 videos so that you can watch one at a time. But honestly, like that's the best that I could do. Like I can't distill it to five minutes and then just be like, aha, ADHD cured. That doesn't work like that.
