 Part of the reason that we have difficulty falling asleep is because our brain doesn't know what's daytime and what's nighttime, because generally speaking, the two are the same, right? So I wake up, I sit in this office, I turn on some artificial lights, and my brain doesn't know whether it's daytime or nighttime. In fact, the way that this setup is made is that it looks the same, whether it's daytime or nighttime, so we can control for lighting. So what you really want to do is try to spend some time outdoors, ideally immediately after you wake up. But you want to give your brain a period of light and give your brain a period of darkness. Even if you're working on a screen, try to do it in a place where you have windows or get some kind of sunshine, go outside for a few minutes. And this is the key thing. You also, as best as possible, want to give your brain darkness. So what I would recommend is going outside in the AM and after dark. This is also very important. In my experience, our brain is really, really good at picking up different kinds of things. There's no doubt in my mind that somehow your brain can tell it is nighttime if we're outside. Engage your diurnal rhythm and let your brain know, hey, it's like nighttime now.
