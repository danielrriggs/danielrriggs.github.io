 What's the point of good posture? Is it just looking better? Or is there a feeling that you have when? Well, so there's all kinds of reasons why you want a good posture, everything from like biology to spirituality. The basic problem is that weight should be supported by bone, not muscle. So if I, for example, if I do this and you push down, you can put like 100 pounds of force on my arm and my arm will be fine. But if you put five pounds of force like this, my arm will go down. So if you sort of look at it, we want the bones of our body to support our weight. And when we have bad posture, when your spine is curved, now suddenly the weight of your upper torso is over here because your spine is curved. Whereas if you have your spine like this and all of the weight of your body is over here, then your muscles can relax, right? Because they're not carrying the load of your body. So what we tend to see a lot is like tension in the trapezius and around the neck muscles, like all these back problems, or because we don't sit properly because our spine is designed to support our weight.
