 You know, the avoidance of pain is frequently what gets us into the most trouble. I know one thing I've sort of noticed as a psychiatrist is that people tend to avoid pain, first of all, which makes perfect sense. But honestly, I've seen just as many lives ruined by positive emotions and being out of control with your positive emotions. And I'm not just talking about mania. I'm talking about falling in love with someone. I'm talking about, you know, really love is destroyed just as many lives that I've seen that, you know, hate has, which sounds really bizarre to say. But I've kind of seen it in terms of what people will tolerate because they love someone, what people will inflict on someone because they love someone. And it's sort of like this possessive sort of love and also the other people that you are willing to hurt if you are in love with a particular person.
