 And so then we sort of develop some of these coping mechanisms where, I know it sounds kind of weird, but there's actually research that shows that coping mechanisms lead to poor outcomes. Coping mechanisms can make your life worse. And why is that? It sounds really weird, right? Because everyone's like, learn to cope, like you meditate, like, oh, like meditate more, like meditate your problems away. But the reason for that is that when we cope, when something's bothering me in life, and I learn how to cope, I no longer need to fix it because it's not bothering me anymore. This is why people in abusive relationships end up addicted to substances, because this person hurts me and I can make the hurt go away by using drugs or substances or TikTok, whatever. And then as I make those feelings go away, I tolerate the relationship. Coping is not fixing.
