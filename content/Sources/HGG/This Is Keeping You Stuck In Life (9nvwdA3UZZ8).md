 So if you want to catch up in life, so if I'm afraid of heights, prevents me from climbing a mountain versus I acknowledge, hey, I'm afraid of heights, but I'm not going to let it control me. I'm going to climb a mountain anyway. How do I feel once I've climbed the mountain? Am I still afraid of heights? Yeah, but I did it anyway. And once you start doing that, something revolutionary will happen. Who you are no longer dictates what you do. And as who you are and your emotions no longer dictate what you do, this is when you will start catching up. This is the key thing. What keeps people stuck for 15 years is that they sabotage their efforts because their sense of ego, identity and emotions get in the way of them even making progress. That's the real problem. Notice that all of the logic in my mind is leading to one conclusion. My mind is actually trying to convince you. Why is your mind using logic? It's trying to convince you. It recognizes that this may not be true, but if it convinces you, it protects you from pain, but leaves you stuck.
