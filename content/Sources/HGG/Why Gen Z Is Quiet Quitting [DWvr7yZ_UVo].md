 So everyone's wondering why Gen Z is so nihilistic. And I see stuff like, you know, these corporate CEOs who are like, no one wants to work anymore. And the kids don't, they don't have discipline and they don't have no work ethic. And everyone's just lazy and everyone's just like, ah, no one's chasing things. And the reason that Gen Z thinks that life has no meaning is because life has no meaning. So if we really stop and think about it, in the past, the meaning of life or what got us through our early years was this kind of script that later on we will be happy, right? There was this sort of idea that if you sit down and you work hard for a while, eventually the good things will come. And the purpose of life is to have the good things. And so early on, when we're sort of like, when our brains are young and we're still sort of forming what life is, we would kind of go through stuff and we'd say like, okay, this is the prize over here. There's the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Let me follow the rainbow because eventually I'll be happy.
