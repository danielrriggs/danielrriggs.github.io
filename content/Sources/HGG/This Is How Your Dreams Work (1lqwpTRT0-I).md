 This is how dreams work. So when you've got a bunch of emotions, when you stop and dream, what happens is you feel those emotions. If someone's chasing you in a dream, you're actually really scared, right? Like that fear is 100% real. If there's lust in a dream, like I don't know if you've had those kind of dreams, but like, you know what I'm saying? Like that's some good dreaming right there. But so really what happens when we dream is the emotions that we feel are real. It's not about like the circumstances of the dream. So there was like, I was driving a car, and then a giant tooth came and smashed my car. And then once I was smashed in the car, I turned into a rabbit. And then I flew up into the sky and I saw the eye of God and the eye of God was crying. All that like imagery crap. I don't think there's a whole lot of very solid scientific evidence that like the tooth means something and the eye of God means something. But what we do know more scientifically is that the emotions that you've stored up throughout your time during the day or your life will come out in dreams.
