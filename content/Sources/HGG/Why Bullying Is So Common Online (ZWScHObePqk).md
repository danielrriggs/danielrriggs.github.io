 So don't get into stupid arguments with people, and if you get into stupid arguments with people, start to think a little bit about what this does for you. When I get into arguments with idiots, I feel better about myself. And since I'm feeling crap about myself, I can do two things. I can go bully someone, or I can get some dumbass on the internet into an argument that is indefensible and bully them. And then I'm gonna see all my stuff get upvoted, I'm gonna see all their stuff get downvoted, and then I'm gonna feel good about myself. And once I feel good about myself, I'm not gonna make any changes in my life because my life is shit. And instead of fixing that, I can school noobs on the internet. This is what happens on the internet.
