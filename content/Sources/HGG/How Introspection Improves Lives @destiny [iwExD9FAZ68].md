 If you take a person that is underachieving in school and then they become more introspective, self-reflective, and get a greater understanding of themselves, it's harder to imagine, or it's hard to imagine that their life doesn't also significantly improve in other ways. Because my guess would probably be that those people that are in those bad situations are probably more inhibited than an average person when it comes to those introspective things. So opening that up would help them. That's a brilliant assumption that you're making because that's like literally, that's what happened in my case, what we see a lot, right? So if we think about what is the effect on a human being, of a bad situation, it hurts. And then our instinctive response when something hurts is to numb it, because we haven't been taught how to fix it. So then we ignore it. And then what we actually see is people in bad situations are more introspectively blind. I don't think that's an evidence-based statement, but that's my opinion.
