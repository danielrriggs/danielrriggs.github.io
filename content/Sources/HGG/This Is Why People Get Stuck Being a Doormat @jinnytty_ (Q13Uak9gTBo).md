 What you give people is what they're going to want. So we see this a lot with like streamers and parasocial relationships, but this is true of like everyday relationships too, that if you give people complete access to your life, that's what they're going to come to expect. And they'll start to get really, really upset if you ever try to take that away. But this is also true of like our everyday relationships, where I know so many people who will allow others to violate their boundaries. And then I get stuck in this really, really interesting trap, which is if I ever tell them no, they start to leave. And this was the very thing that I was afraid of to begin with. And now all of my fears are coming true by setting boundaries. But the really tricky thing is that this is a problem of my own creation when I tolerated it in the first place. When I set a particular standard, then people become entitled to violating my boundaries. And the whole reason I let them do that in the first place is because I'm afraid of them leaving. And so it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, which is why people get stuck.
