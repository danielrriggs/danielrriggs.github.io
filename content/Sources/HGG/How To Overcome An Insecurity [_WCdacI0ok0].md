 So if you really want to understand how to overcome an insecurity, what you need to do is starve it. So anything that we give into in the mind grows. So if I'm feeling insecure about my appearance, and I text a friend of mine, and I send them a selfie, and I say, hey, will you look at this? Do I look okay? In that moment, when you have an emotion, what is your solution to the emotion? It is to engage in a behavior that reassures you and makes the emotions go down. But what you're actually doing in that moment is feeding the insecurity. Because you're giving the insecurity what it wants, the insecurity wants reassurance. And so the more that we give the insecurity what it wants, the stronger it becomes. If I'm insecure about my appearance, and my insecurity is saying, hey, you don't look good, and I say, okay, fine, then I will cancel my social plans so that I don't have to worry about feeling ugly. Then I've just fed my insecurity, and it will grow. So anything that you feed in the mind grows.
