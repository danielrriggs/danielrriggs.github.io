 Time is a scam. So if we think about what screws us up most of the time in life, it is time. Why do you waste today? Because there is tomorrow. That which can be done at any time will be done at no time. Why is procrastination so successful? Procrastination is a solution, by the way. I wait till the end, the last minute to get things done. Time in our conception and relationship with time causes us so many problems. So if I think about eating some food, the enjoyment from the food is in the food. Everything else is a scam. Oh, I can eat it tomorrow, so I'm going to take it for granted. Therefore, I don't enjoy it. Appreciate today because it'll be different tomorrow. Today is all I have. How am I going to spend it?
