 So what psychotherapists will do is teach people with ADHD how to function in this world, despite having distractible attention. It means things like get really good with your calendar, make a to-do list. So one tip that I'll give people is that if you're working on a project, find all of your materials first and assemble them. Don't go and look for materials in the middle of your work. So if you've got some stuff on Google Drive or Dropbox, open it all up and set it to the side or print those papers out and keep them there. Because if you open up a new tab and start hunting for stuff on the internet, when you are trying to write a paper and you have ADHD, you're screwed. All of your work materials need to be organized. Calendar, alarms, all kinds of stuff. You can set up a system that will essentially protect you from your ADHD.
