 So now we need to understand what really sabotages us when we need to catch up. The first thing that sabotages us are our emotions. So when you try to catch up in life, your mind will give you reasons to not catch up. So it'll say, don't go to that party. No one will like you or it won't be enough. These are really classics that I've worked with. Tons of people are behind. And if you've been thinking that, pay attention, okay? It won't be enough. It's not going to work. So now if we pay attention to what's happening in your mind, what is the direction of all of these thoughts? The direction of all of these thoughts is to not do it. Now this is what we have to understand about the mind. The mind may present you with things that seem logical, but generally speaking, if you're behind in life, chances are your emotions are controlling you.
