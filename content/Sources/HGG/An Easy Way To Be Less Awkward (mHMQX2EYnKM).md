 If you want to stop being awkward, absorb your mind in whatever is around you. Instead of about what you should say or whether you should say something, pay attention to what the other person is saying. Listen to the other person. Listen to your surroundings. Externalize your awareness and then you will not be awkward. And if we sort of think about it, we can see that we can prove it the other way too. When am I the least awkward? When I'm absorbed in something. Like if I get into bed at night and I grab a nice cool pillow and I lay down and I'm like, man, this feels amazing. I'm not thinking about, okay, how can I feel more comfortable? Is this comfortable enough? Is this not comfortable enough? If my attention is on the pillow and on the bed, I will feel relaxed and it'll feel good. And this is why people say so awkward is because everyone's like, what do I do? It is not about doing, it is about where your attention is.
