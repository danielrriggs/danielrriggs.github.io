 One of the most important skills that people don't practice is how to ignore yourself. This is the foundation of what the Stoics and Yogis discovered, that if you want to have control and happiness in your life, ignoring yourself is actually the first step. And this is becoming increasingly important in today's society because of things like technology. As we get more and more cookies added to our browsers and stuff like that, people know what you want and they're going to trigger different desires in you, right? This is why we have notifications on your phone. And it's not just in technology. There's also been some really fascinating research recently that additives in food will neuroscientifically induce cravings. Even the food that we eat is actually inducing impulses within us and trying to get us to eat things. So if you want control over your life and you want to like reduce unhealthy eating habits, maybe tackle things like obesity, stop using technology and stop giving into your emotions, take the road that the Stoics and Yogis took and actually learn how to ignore your impulses.
