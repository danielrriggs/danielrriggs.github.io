 When people struggle with a problem, they hear about solutions from the self-help space. If I struggle with anxiety, like if I can learn to be a Stoic, then my anxiety will be fixed. Right. And so then instead of actually fixing your anxiety, what you try to do is become a good Stoic. Exactly. And the better Stoic you can become, eventually if you keep on leveling up Stoicism, anxiety will be conquered. So it's almost like you're using Stoicism as a distraction away from fixing your problems. Exactly. That's exactly right. And so weirdly enough, self-help is a way to not help yourself. That's so well put. That's exactly what I was thinking. It's almost as if it's like shining a spotlight away from your true problems. Because I was struggling with like burnout and anxiety, and the best self-help I ever got was to quit my job.
