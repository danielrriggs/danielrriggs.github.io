 What Stoicism is, is not being affected by things that affect you. It's kind of weird. Things still affect you, but you don't let the things that affect you control your life. It's not that you're numb. There's a principle in Buddhism called the two arrows. And this principle is that anytime life shoots an arrow at us and we get hit by an arrow, that hurts. And then what we do is shoot a second arrow at ourselves for being hit by the first one. Stoicism is preventing that second arrow. It's not that things don't hurt. Marcus Aurelius felt a full range of emotions. He was just tranquil in the face of those emotions. So tranquility is not about being numb. It's about staying grounded when there are emotions in front of you. And feeling those things honestly come to the fullest. And when you feel them to the fullest, they lose their power over you.
