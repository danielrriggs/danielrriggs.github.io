 You know, I'm not sure if I believe in soulmates, but I believe a soulmate isn't someone who is perfect for you right as you meet. But I believe what's truly special and truly important is finding someone who you are willing to change yourself to become a better person for that person. And that person reciprocates that by doing it for you. It's some real anime level sh** right here. Is this... This is just like, you know, this is just how I envisioned how to have a happy life. I think like the end goal of everything, I think the end goal of all of this, I just want to be happy, man. Like, I just want to be happy with myself and my life around me. Yeah, I'm just constantly on a journey to be the happiest person I can be. Why? Why? Life is just better if you're happy. Your life experience will always change, your life situation will always change. But if you're happy, the world is just brighter. You feel good just being alive and existing, I guess.
