 There are two kinds of people in life. The people who want an easy life, so they seek an easy life, and they avoid a hardness. And their life becomes hard, right? So when you're sitting here and you're avoiding the work that you have to do when you're not exercising, you're not doing yoga because you want an easy life, you want an easy life, in search of an easy life, you create an easy life today. A life of indulgence, a life of lack of effort, a life where you screw yourself over tomorrow. Then your life will be hard. And paradoxically, the ones who embrace a difficult life today will have an easier life tomorrow. And the more that you embrace difficulty, the easier your life will become until you reach a point where you are relatively sattvic. And as you're relatively sattvic, something magical will happen. Your body and mind will start to listen to you. And if your body and mind listen to you, you don't need motivation. You don't need willpower because it is compliant. It is a well-trained animal. When you tell the horse to go this way, it goes this way. And then your life will truly become easy.
