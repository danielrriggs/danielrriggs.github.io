 Healthy Gamer is a digital mental health platform that's designed to help especially young people with the problems of the digital age. We do everything from psychoeducation on our Twitch and YouTube channels, as well as community-run events that help people learn some of the skills that kids in the digital age have difficulty developing. And we also have a peer support program that helps people with things like forming social connections, finding direction in life. We think it's really important to meet people where they're at, in their language, in their online spaces, where they're talking about their anxiety or their isolation or their loneliness on places like Discord and Twitch. That's where we want to be. We want to spread psychoeducation about different mental health conditions to 10,000, a million people in one shot. There is a huge movement for better mental health, for breaking down social barriers. I think it's creating a huge cultural shift and it's been beautiful.
