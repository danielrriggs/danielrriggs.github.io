 Burnout doesn't come from overwork. Burnout doesn't come from laziness, shockingly. In fact, the opposite. Burnout comes from excessive effort with minimal benefit. For far too long in our society have we taken advantage of people who are doing altruistic jobs? And I'm thinking especially of like teachers and people in the medical profession, where these are jobs that we like value, almost like on a moral sense, right? Like you're saving lives. We're educating children and it's for the children. What we've managed to do is create situations where we take advantage of individuals altruism. I see employees getting taken advantage of the most in these two professions because you're saving lives, like you're doing it for a good reason, right? So why are you complaining about the pay? And what we also tend to see in both of these professions, if you look at like tuition, right? And you look at like college education and things like that. If you look at the education industry and the medical industry, this is also where you see like tons of profit.
