 So when we really think about what detachment is, so like here's the world down here, and here's us up here. And we kind of sit in the middle, and I know that sounds kind of weird, what do I mean by that? So we kind of sit over here, and what we think detachment means, we think it means removing ourselves from the world. But if you really look at it, what detachment truly means is removal from our own ego. So when we remove ourselves from our ego, that's when we actually become detached. Let's say I want to dance at a party. The music is fantastic. I really, really feel like dancing. What is it that keeps me from dancing? Because I can hear the music, I want to move, maybe I don't know how to dance, but who the hell cares, right? Generally speaking, people who like dancing to music don't care if they know how to dance or don't know how to dance. You can still dance to the music and enjoy it. But what is it that keeps you from enjoying that moment in the world? It's not the world itself, it's your own ego. It's this idea that, oh my god, if I start dancing, I will look stupid because I don't know how to dance.
