 If we're struggling with feeling sad, it's really important to understand. If you're feeling sad, is this something that is a distortion of my mind that is being created out of my depression? Because if that's the case, that means that I don't trust my sad thoughts, or do my sad thoughts come first? It's not that I shouldn't trust my thought, it's that there may be something that I need to do to prevent my pessimistic thoughts from making me depressed. The tricky thing is that you don't know what to believe. Are the thoughts real and then I'm just not handling them properly, which is why I'm getting depressed? Or are the thoughts a creation of this cognitive distortion? Because it leads to two very different things. Do I need to be managing my thoughts better? Do I need to fix the way that I deal with my thoughts so that they don't make me depressed? Or are they coming from such a toxic place that I need to learn how to step away from the whole thing entirely? And it's confusing for people because we don't really explain stuff.
