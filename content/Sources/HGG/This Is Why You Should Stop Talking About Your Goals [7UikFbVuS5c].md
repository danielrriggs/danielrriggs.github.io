 When you talk about something, you will end up diminishing your internal energy. So when I was like a kid, like I was like 17 years old, I would tell people I wanted to become a doctor. And then they would get impressed by that, right? It's kind of bizarre. It's like if you tell people when you're 16, like, yeah, I'm going to be a doctor one day. And everyone's like, oh my god, you're going to be a doctor. Look at you. You're so great. And so what we sort of discover is that when you talk about what you're going to do, you actually get a positive reinforcement externally. So people are like impressed with what you're going to do. And then something really subtle happens. The moment that you get a reward by talking about something, what are you actually reinforcing? The first is that you're reinforcing that talking about stuff gets you a reward. And the second thing is that you're getting the reward without actually doing anything. So what ends up happening is as you talk about stuff, your motivation to actually follow through starts to leak away.
