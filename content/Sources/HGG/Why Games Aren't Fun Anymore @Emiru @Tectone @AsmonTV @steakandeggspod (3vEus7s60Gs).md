 The thing about Dark Souls lore is like, not everyone is into it, right? But the people who are into it, like really crave it. Oh yeah. It's really interesting because I watched like lore videos for Dark Souls one, two and three. And then I understood enough about how they put the story together to where the cool thing about Elden Ring is like, I decided I'm not gonna watch any lore videos, I'm gonna figure out for myself. Oh my God. And so it's actually like sleuthing. And this is the problem is that if you look today, like if you look at WoW, for example, like you go to WoW Wiki and everything's on there. There's no discovery in games. Not only is everything on there, the future patch has been data mined from the public test ground. Absolutely. All of the cinematics, the voice lines have been put on there and you already know who's gonna die. So like discovery, like back when I, you know, when I was growing up, we were talking about the NES. There wasn't the internet. So you had to, games were full of discovery. Like every game you played, you have to figure things out.
