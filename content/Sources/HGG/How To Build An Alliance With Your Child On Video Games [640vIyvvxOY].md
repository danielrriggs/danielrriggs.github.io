 So usually they come to me because there's a problematic behavior in the household, where the kid is throwing a temper tantrum because of games or like it's bedtime and they like start flipping chairs. And what I tend to find is that once again the most important thing that most people miss is building an alliance with the child and trying to really figure out what does the child understand. Now if you're saying I've explained that to them a thousand times, that's not how you recognize understanding. You ask questions. And the more that you ask them questions, the more you see what they understand, you're also modeling a different kind of behavior there. If I have a kid who goes into Walmart and starts opening up toys, what do I do? Hey, you can't do that. Stop. Punishments. What are you modeling for the child? You're actually modeling my way or the highway. Absolutely no way that you can open up a toy at Walmart without paying for it. I don't care what your opinion is. And so what is the child learning? Child is learning no means no. So when mom tells me to put the toy away, mom no means no. I'm not going to put the toy away. No means no, because that's what you've taught me. You got to talk to the kid. You got to understand the kid.
