 So when you look at your life and nothing is going well, you don't have friends, you don't have a job, you just dropped out of high school, you've never been in a relationship. Fixing each and every one of these problems is absolutely overwhelming. How are you supposed to catch up? Can't. So what do you actually do about it? What you've got to do is change your mind, change your thinking. So oddly enough, the first step is blame. Depression is anger turned against the self. You pull it away from your parents and you all point it in here. Accountability needs to be like more evenly spread. Dropping out of high school only happens with parental support. They didn't see your grades, they didn't like realize, they never asked you how's your homework going. We're not blaming in terms of like, oh, you did this to me. So we're not sort of saying you need to be resentful and angry and stuff like that. We just need to acknowledge that sometimes like crap happens in life and that's because there's a confluence events where something kind of slips through the cracks. And if your parents were too busy to do this stuff, or if they were never taught how to do this stuff, and they had to kind of muddle through and struggle and stuff like that, that's actually all okay to acknowledging that not everything in your life is actually your fault.
