 Ventilating our emotions can be helpful, but what's really, really important is processing our emotions. And I've seen this mistake be made by therapists as well, where there are some therapists that I've worked with and some therapists that I've learned from that sort of will say things like, yeah, you know, the therapy just takes time and we're going to sit there and we're going to let the patient figure things out. I'm going to take a more passive role. And I had one mentor, for example, who told me that it took three years for the patient to make a breakthrough and they hadn't really made much progress then. And then what I was sort of wondering is like, what the hell were you guys doing for the first two and a half years? So sometimes therapy is not a passive experience of just ventilating your feelings, because as y'all know, sometimes those feelings can keep coming back over and over and over again. You can feel sad every day for a year and it's not like journaling that sadness out necessarily makes it better.
