 Where does belief come from? I think within oneself. Not really. Belief comes from the outside. Knowledge comes from within. So if someone is, if I'm seeing lots of advertisements for video game and I believe that cyberpunk will be amazing at launch, that is a belief. And was cyberpunk amazing at launch? I guess not. You are correct. So belief is the absence of knowledge. You cannot have knowledge if you can have belief. Do you understand? Right. So knowledge comes from within. Belief is a hypothesis that is based on external points. That's fine to believe. There's nothing wrong with beliefs, but we must understand where beliefs come from and what the limit is. So it is a belief because it is based on statistics. It's not based on evidence. No, isn't it? Yeah, you're right. Do you believe in aliens once you get abducted and they do these kinds of things with, you know, then it will no longer believe. It will be knowledge.
