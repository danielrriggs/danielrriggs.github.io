 You're the hardest worker when it comes to other people, but you can't do anything for yourself. When there's a hard job to be done, you're going to volunteer. When there's overtime, you're going to do it. When someone needs someone to do something, you can do it. But when you need to do something for yourself, you can't. So there's a couple of core things here. The first, the core reason why we do this is because we value other people over ourselves. This is the root of the problem. Because if someone else needs a sacrifice, you're willing to make it for them. But you're not willing to make a sacrifice for you. Let's understand that. It's very simple. Other people are worth more than you are. It's not rocket science. Oh, someone else is sick and they need like freshly cooked food. Like, okay, I can make it for them. But if I'm sick, eh, I'll already take out. Like maybe you're sick and you're not, you know, you're low energy. So maybe not the best example. But the core reason that we're willing to bend over backwards for other people and do nothing for ourselves is because we value other people more than we value ourselves.
