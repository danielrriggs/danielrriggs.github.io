 What is boredom? Boredom is an attempt by your brain to get that hit of dopamine. This is why it makes boredom so damn uncomfortable. So if we think about the sensations within ourselves that prompt us to action, that force us into action, all of those sensations are uncomfortable. Hunger is uncomfortable. Thirst is uncomfortable. And so why does our body make us feel uncomfortable? To bludgeon us into acting. And what's the biggest club it's got? It's actually boredom.
