 If you are a man and you do something that I do not like, then I will call you toxically masculine. If you're a man and you do something that people appreciate, then we will call it healthy masculine. So the difference between toxic masculinity and healthy masculinity is all based on the approval of the person that is thinking about it, which can include you, by the way. So even if you look at yourself and you dislike some aspect of yourself, you will attribute that to toxic masculinity or a lack of healthy masculinity. So if we sort of think about this, the way that we beat ourselves up for not being manly enough, it's a hurtful thing. So that's why I'm applying the term toxic, but it's kind of like this impression of what a man should be that I don't live up to, which then I hurt myself. Like I beat myself up for it. So that becomes kind of toxic. If you do something that is masculine and people don't like it, they're going to call you a toxic masculine asshole. And if they do like it, if they appreciate it, they will call it healthy masculinity.
