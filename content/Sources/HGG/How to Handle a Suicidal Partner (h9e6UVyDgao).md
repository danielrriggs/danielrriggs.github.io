 How do I keep my partner from not being suicidal? How do I share any kind of feedback with them? So if you're in a relationship with someone, I want you all to understand something. Suicidality, do you influence it? Sure. But suicidality can sometimes be used as a form of emotional manipulation. It's like a trump card to avoid particular topics. Oh, this is making me suicidal. I guess we can never talk about it again. We'll see this sometimes in like romantic relationships and stuff where people like threaten suicide. Like if you break up with me, I'm going to kill myself. And then what happens, something very subtle happens, is that if you're in a relationship with someone who uses suicidal blackmail to keep you in the relationship, you feel responsible for their behavior. You become responsible for their behavior. They say, hey, the responsibility for my mental health is now controlled by your actions. And then what we do because we're terrified by suicidal, we're like, okay, okay, I'll take it. I'll protect you. I'll never break up with you. I'll be here for you always. And then the other person subconscious is like, well, shit, this works great.
