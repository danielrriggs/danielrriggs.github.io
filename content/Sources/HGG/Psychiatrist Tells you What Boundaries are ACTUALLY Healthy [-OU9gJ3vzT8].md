 I should be able to eat Cheetos and play World of Warcraft for 28 hours a day if that's what I want to do. That's my boundary. That's what I need. How dare other people cause me to respect, like alter my boundary. But if you're struggling in terms of dating, like communication skills is really what it comes down to. It's about articulating your boundaries, getting them to articulate theirs, respecting their boundaries, having them respect yours, but also in sort of compromising certain boundaries, which is like eye-opening. Oh my god, I'm supposed to compromise a boundary. That's insane. It's my boundaries. People should respect it.
