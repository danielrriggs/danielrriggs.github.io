 So there's actually good data that suggests that gaming actually makes people better at real life. So the first thing is that in 2015, the United States Department of Defense did a study on advantages of video gaming. And what they found is that the soldiers who played video games actually have a 20% higher fluid IQ than soldiers who don't. Now, fluid IQ is a general IQ dimension that involves problem solving. So what we sort of know is that people who play lots of games are actually much better at problem solving than the people in the average population. So if you sort of think about a video game, what is a video game? It's a new set of rules with new challenges. Every time you pick up a new video game, the rules have changed, the goals have changed, and the tools that you have at your disposal to accomplish whatever those goals are has changed. So gamers get really, really good at problem solving. There's absolutely an element of hand-eye coordination that's really, really important.
