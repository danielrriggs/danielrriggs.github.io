 Now, what are some healthy coping skills? I think oftentimes we like talk about the standard stuff like meditation is actually really, really good. We can also do other kinds of things like think about the things that you do that help you feel better, but also don't set you up for getting screwed later. So there are unhealthy coping mechanisms, things like, you know, video games, pornography, alcohol, substances of abuse, all that kind of stuff. And I think social like reaching out to people socially, leaning on people like for social support. There's overwhelming evidence that animals can be incredibly helpful for our mental health. I've worked with so many patients who what literally keeps them alive, they're thinking about suicide, but like who would take care of their dog or cat. And that's actually a really strong foundation to build on. So I don't know, depending on where you are in life, but like getting a pet is actually not a bad idea.
