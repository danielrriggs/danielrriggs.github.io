 So one of the simplest things that you can do if you really want to start to get a handle on your ego is anytime you make a conclusion about yourself, take a step back and say, my mind says instead of I am. So my mind says I am a failure instead of I am a failure. And even creating that little bit of distance, if you chip away at it over time, will start to change your perspective. The second thing that you can do is as you start to do this, notice what your mind is saying because that sense of failure is not, it's coming from the mind, is a conclusion, it is a mental construction. And so you can see the mental construction over here, but you're going to be over here. And then what you should ask yourself is if the sense of failure is within the mind, what is it that's doing the looking? And is the thing that is doing the looking, is that a failure? That's the question you should ask yourself. And that is how you will discover what you are, which is outside of ego.
