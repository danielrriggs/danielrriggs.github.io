 One thing you can do to break the cycle of overgeneralization, which is to remove I from the equation. If you look at someone who's depressed, one of the key things is that they always think that they're at fault. And this is going to sound really weird because if you pay attention to your thoughts and you're depressed or you're feeling bad, we're not talking about clinical depression, we're just talking about you're kind of in a bad headspace. What you'll find is everything has to do with you. These people would be better off without me. They'd have more fun if they if I didn't even go. The work, everyone would be happier at work. Everything is about me, me, me, me, me. So what we know about depression is it's actually quite narcissistic in some ways. We even know that the part of your brain that thinks about you is hyperactive in depression. This is the part of the brain called the default mode network.
