 A lot of times the reason that people hate their jobs is because they're not recognized in their jobs. The effort that they put in is not appreciated. They have trouble advocating for themselves and people are playing politics. Sometimes it's because the job is really, really, really boring. And even in those cases, why don't those people quit those jobs? Well, because they're afraid of the consequences of quitting a job. What if I don't find another job? What if people won't hire me somewhere else? So even if you look at each of those scenarios about why we hate the job, what we actually discover is that it's not the job itself that actually keeps you stuck. It's all of your attachments related to the job. It's wanting to be appreciated by your boss, wanting to be recognized, wanting to be respected by your peers, which by the way is what leads you to work extra hard to get that recognition. So any way you cut it, what you really discover is that attachment and ego are really the things that kind of hold us back in life.
