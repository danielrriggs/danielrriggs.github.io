 People will say, okay, men should express their emotions. People say, oh my God, healthy masculinity is expressing your emotions. And if you express your emotions, that's a sign of healthy masculinity. Well, so here's my question. Does that include all emotions? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's silly. You should express your emotions, but only the ones that we want you to express. If you express anger, that's toxic masculinity, right? No, no, no, no. The emotion you should express is crying. This is the one that you're allowed to express. If you're ashamed of yourself, oh my god, don't burden me with that, man up, be stronger. And if you get angry, oh my god, that's, how dare you, that is a sign of toxic masculinity. So the emotions that people are okay with us expressing, the external judgments of healthy masculinity or toxic masculinity are stupid because it's someone else's standard and they're gonna judge you for it.
