 Acceptance is acknowledgement of the present circumstances. And then once you acknowledge what the present circumstances are, like in my case, like I realized like, holy s**t, this girl is not giving up on me. She deserves better, right? And there's two things that can happen when a dude has that thought. Number one is, oh my God, you're going to leave me, right? You're going to leave me and you're going to find someone better because you deserve better and you don't deserve me. The second is I'm going to become better. I'm going to become what you deserve. And it's when people start doing that, when both parties do that in the relationship, I'm going to be what you deserve. I'm going to grow for the sake of this relationship. I'm going to get better. It's not, if you can't accept me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best. It's that I'm grateful that you're accepting me at my worst and you deserve nothing less than the best 24 seven. And that's what I'm moving towards, but you cannot do that unless you accept that there's a part of you that's here and now.
