 If you fall behind in life, chances are the reason you fell behind is because you were with other people who are generally keeping you behind. Or it can be a friend group of like fellow degenerates, and I was one, right? Like, so the thing that we love as degenerates is when like everyone else is degenerate with us. Because if everyone else is like out there living their life, then I'm going to feel really bad about myself. So I actually end up avoiding those people that make me feel bad about myself, and I join my tribe, which is the degenerates. And we're all going to be degenerates together. We're going to be anti-capitalism, anti-work, anti-the-man, anti-everything, and we're going to sit here, we're going to smoke our pot, and we're going to play our games, and we're going to be... it's going to be great. I'm not saying that capitalism isn't bad in some ways, but I'm encouraging you to think a little bit about the company you keep. And what we know from like the science of things like addiction recovery is that changing your company is really important.
