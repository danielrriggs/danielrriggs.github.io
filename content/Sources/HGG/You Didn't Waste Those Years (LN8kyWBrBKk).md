 Doing something that you don't love for six years and doing a decent job, the ability to develop a work ethic in the absence of motivation and passion is absolutely worth a six-year investment. Because when you move to storytelling, whether you succeed as a storyteller or not, you can't base it on your passion. You can't base it on your interests. You're not going to be successful that way. You even need, hey, I'm choosing storytelling after seven years of spending time on architecture. I really got to make it work because I've given up a lot to choose this. That kind of motivation, that kind of passion, that kind of sacrifice will let you double down and do so much better. I felt that in medical school. I tried so damn hard to get into medical school, got rejected from 120 medical schools. Some medical schools rejected me multiple times. And then when I got in, it's like, there's no way that I'm letting this opportunity slip through my fingers. And I didn't realize the value of what I had been given until I had to make a real sacrifice to get it.
