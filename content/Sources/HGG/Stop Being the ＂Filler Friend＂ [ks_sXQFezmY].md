 If you are in a group and people are making plans about stuff and they don't seem to be including you, you can say, hey, that sounds awesome. Is it an open invitation? Is it cool if I come? You can just ask and pay attention to your reaction to doing that, right? Everyone's like, oh my God, and look who's got a case of the what ifs. Look, you've got a case of the what ifs. That's why you're the filler friend. And if they say you can't come or it's not an open invitation, then that's totally fine, right? You know that these people are not interested in you. You're not stuck feeling like a filler friend. And people may think, oh my God, like, who's this weirdo who's inviting himself? He's not inviting himself or she's not inviting herself. She's just asking, could she come along, right? And then here's the follow-up. If they say, yeah, sure, you can come. Come. Cool.
