 So if you really want to overcome perfectionism, there are a couple of things you have to do. The first is to focus on your actions instead of the outcomes. So whether you studied enough is not based on whether you're going to get an A or not. It's really stop and think about, OK, like, what am I here to learn and how much time am I willing to devote? And I'm going to devote that. And that's going to be like enough, right? Because studying 50 hours may be unreasonable, but maybe I can do like 20 hours this week. So it's to really focus on the action instead of the outcome. You learn this the hard way in med school. You know, we have a lot of great medicine like we can literally we can remove a heart from someone's body and keep them alive. So one of the brutal lessons that you learn is that as a doctor, how do I know I do a good job? Like, how can I live with myself? What you focus on is, did I do the best job that I could? Should I have studied more? Should I have like, you know, run more tests? Should I have consulted with other people? And so all you can do as a doctor is like what you can do. And the rest of it, like you can't control is based on God or the universe or RNG or like whatever you want to call it.
