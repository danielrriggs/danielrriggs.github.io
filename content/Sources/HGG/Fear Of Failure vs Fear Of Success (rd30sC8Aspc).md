 Where it's like, well, I'm tired of being a failure, but every time I try to go and be successful and fix my life, it's like, it's so hard. And then you muster up a bunch of willpower and you force yourself to apply for a new job, and then you go to work, and then you ghost after two weeks. Or you get fired. And so then you get really confused because you're like, hold on a second. I understand that I'm afraid of failure, but why am I afraid of success too? Those are opposites. The fear of failure drives me to want success. So I want success, but then I try to become successful, and I'm scared of that too. Like, but that's what I want. How can I be scared of what I want? The fear of failure is not the opposite of the fear of success. It is actually the same damn fear. You can't be two things at once. It's the same damn thing, right? So when people say, oh, there's a thin line between love and hate, but they're opposites, right? No, they're not opposites. They're the same damn thing. And you may say, how are love and hate the same damn thing? They're both attachment. The connection to the other person is what causes those things. It doesn't matter what you're transmitting, but you're tightly connected. Y'all see that? So the fear of failure and fear of success aren't different. They're actually the same damn thing.
