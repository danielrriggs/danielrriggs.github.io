 Parents have never had to deal with technology like this before. Do you all realize like how hard it is to be a parent today when it comes to technology? All your kids, everyone's kids, kids are getting cell phones at the age of seven. So I have to start fighting this battle today as a parent. And this is the thing about parenting that we don't understand. How do you learn how to parent? You grow up with parents. You learn what your parents did, right? That's how we learn parenting. It's not like we take classes. You don't have to take a class. You just need PIV in and out, in and out, right? That's all you need. And that works. There's no parenting courses for Impala or chimpanzees or human beings. And it's worked for like the history of existence of life forms on the planet. And it's not working anymore because our parents didn't have to deal with this. So they couldn't teach us how to deal with this.
