 So if we are driven towards a behavior due to an emotion, like let's say that I am lonely, I use that loneliness as fuel to connect with other people. That is not going to be a sustainable way to do things because as I'm lonely, a couple of things will happen. The first is that I may run into other negative emotions and then it becomes a battle of emotions. So then like, I'm lonely, so let me leave the house and then, uh-oh, here's social anxiety. You forgot about me because you were all alone in your house, but here I am. Now that we're interacting with other people, I'm going to tell you you're doing a terrible job and make you feel bad about yourself. And then what happens is since you gave into the emotion as your motivation, you are vulnerable to other kinds of emotions taking away that motivation.
