 So when you succeed, the mind of someone with imposter syndrome is going to default to thinking about what other people think. So when I get an A on a test, I'm not happy until my parents say, good job, kid, you're so smart. When I do a good job at work, what I really care about, I can't relax or feel competent or feel proud until my boss says, good job. And once I've made my boss happy, I have maintained the scam. This is another day that's gone by at work where they haven't figured out I'm incompetent and my boss still thinks that I'm a good person. So we really care what other people think and we're not able to take pride in our own accomplishments. The idea that I can be proud of something and someone else may be disappointed in it is completely foreign to someone with imposter syndrome. That just does not compute at all. There's no way I can be proud of something and someone else be disappointed in something.
