 The problem with depression is that we have an inciting event, something genuinely bad happens. This has an emotional reaction. This then turns into a cognitive bias, which then we have a bunch of ambiguous stimuli or even positive stimuli that we start interpreting in a negative way, and then we discount the stuff. So, this cognitive bias is what then what happens is the world that you live in becomes objectively worse because of your filtering out information. So if you're a demoralized programmer, strengthening your perception, which is one of the things that we have gotten the weakest at in our society, I think the number one reason why mental health is getting worse in the world today is because our powers of perception have gotten weaker. I actually, I talk about this quite a lot, is there's a joke that I have, which is the only day that the way that people act on April Fool's Day is the way that they should act in general, which is they meet the internet with scrutiny. They say, wait a minute, is that real? Before they immediately engage and kind of go on with it. April Fool's Day is the only day that happens, and that should be every day. April Fool's Day should be every day. Yeah, love that.
