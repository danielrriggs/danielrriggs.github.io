 People can play games, I certainly have, for eight, 12 hours at a stretch. But if you ask that person, hour five, hour six, hour seven, are you having fun? They're not gonna be having fun. If you watch them, they're not gonna be like smiling and laughing and triumphing. In fact, quite the opposite, what you're gonna see is that they're tilting more, they're getting more frustrated, shorter fused. Tilting is when you basically like get really, really angry and lose your focus in a video game. Okay. So in competitive sports, you know, people will like, if you lose a point or something, you'll go in, you'll be angry and then people will start to play poorly because you're not like focused. Oh, it's like getting the yips in a normal sport, like baseball or whatever, the guy just can't hit. Yeah. Can't hit the, right, okay.
