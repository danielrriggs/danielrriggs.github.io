 People who are sensitive to rejection really negotiate against themselves when it comes to social situations. So you will take any kind of neutral situation or any kind of situation and you will assume the worst and secondly blame yourself the most. So if someone says, hey, I'm sorry, I can't hang out today or they cancel the last minute, you're not going to interpret that as, oh, this person is flaky or they're sick or this is a problem on their end. You are automatically going to interpret that as a problem on your end. So you need to really be aware of the way that you actually like give yourself very little credit and you give them a bunch of credit. You're sort of really willing to negotiate yourself and always take on the mantle of being the bad guy. Because remember in the household that you grew up in, whose fault was it if mommy or daddy were mad? It was your fault. You need to be quieter. I can't believe you didn't put away your toys and they kind of blame you for all this kind of stuff. So you get into a pattern of blaming yourself. So become aware of that pattern.
