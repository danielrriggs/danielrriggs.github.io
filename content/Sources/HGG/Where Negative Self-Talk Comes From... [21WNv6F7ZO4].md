 Where does the negative self-talk in your head come from? It comes from the outside. That's where it starts. So when you have kids that are brow-beaten by parents, nagged by parents, always making comparisons to your older, brighter, stronger, faster, more charismatic sibling, when they always make those comparisons, you learn that in the same way that you learn slang and you learn the language that you speak at home. You learn that kind of self-talk because other people speak to you that way. So if you look at some of these relationships like therapy or coaching or even intimate friendships, intimate romantic partners, mentors, mentees, as people start treating you non-judgmentally, you will learn how to look at yourself non-judgmentally. And by going through your life historically and sort of recognizing how your shame built up over time, as we start to rewrite that history, reinterpret those events, the idealistic self will start to decrease. As the idealistic self starts to decrease, the shame decreases with it because it's the gap between these two things.
