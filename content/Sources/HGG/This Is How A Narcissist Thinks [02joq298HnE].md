 If I get pissed at someone, if I feel hurt and angry at someone, what kind of logic does my mind produce? Does my mind take a step back and be like, hmm, you know, even though I'm pissed at them, maybe I'm the one that's at fault, right? I should really think about their perspective and like, maybe I'm the one who's screwing up here. Of course not. When you get pissed at someone, or more importantly, when someone gets pissed at you, what happens to their rational thinking? It justifies whatever the emotion is, right? When I get angry at someone, they did this wrong, and they did this wrong, and they did this wrong, and if anyone tries to argue with me, I'm going to be like, screw you. You're wrong, right? Why are you wrong? Because I'm angry. Now, flip side, if you've been on the receiving end on this, my heart goes out to you. When someone's mad at you, they'll come up with a thousand reasons to prove their point.
