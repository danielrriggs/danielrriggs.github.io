 we're we're set right we're good yeah can you just tell me if stream looks okay because I'm not going to be able to see it can you guys hear me okay both so both stream looks good okay perfect let's just let's do it so Jessica thank you very much for coming on stream I appreciate it awesome yeah I'm nervous but glad to be here yeah so tell tell us a little bit do you prefer to be called Jessica or madam Faye Jessica's fine so Jessica tell me help me understand a little bit about what sort of motivated you to come on stream and what we're going to be talking about today my husband actually watches Tomination time a lot okay and then he found you through him and he's like I think you would really like this doctor the way he talks about things seems like you would benefit from so I watched a couple videos like yeah yeah I really like this and the the big kicker was the interview that you did with Tom and the exchange that you guys had it wasn't just one person talking you guys both talked about things and I really liked the exchange so after I watched that I sent the email okay well thanks for reaching out so what would you like to talk about today I sent an email and I gave a little bit of details and I can kind of try to backtrack a bit yeah I have I have a lot of self judgment that I have struggled with for a long time mm-hmm and I've been trying to make I guess I try to move forward and figure out how to quell the judgment and just have a better a better healthy self-image uh-huh and I'm just I have no idea where start okay beautiful so I think I already know what your problem is which is that you're trying to quell the self judgment yeah so the first thing to point out is that like so sometimes we have thoughts about ourselves and we're critical and and what do you do when you have those critical thoughts about yourselves I mean it personally it sort of depends on the day sometimes they just keep going other times I'm like no you're you're better than that you're worth more than that yeah that you need to stop doing that and let's go and do something different yeah and so if I were to put it and we'll go into more details but I just kind of want to outline things for the people who are watching so the first thing is like you fight against them right so it's a battle yes and do you know who wins when you fight against yourself probably no one absolutely right so that's the first thing to understand is that like when you fight against yourself you just can't win there's like there's no winning because like you're gonna lose and you're gonna win like that's just and I think this is what happens with self-judgment is like I'm gonna ask you a couple of questions okay Jessica so do you feel like every day so you're you're not fighting against like you're in a war against yourself yeah is that what it feels like yes and it's like kind of a war of attrition yeah and there are some days that you win battles but you're not making progress in the war no it's just it never stops yeah so I want to just point out to you that like you can't like you can overcome that judgment temporarily but over time like like that takes a lot of energy when you overcome it right yes and then eventually like there's gonna be a day I understand you have kids yes yeah so like how many kids you have I have two girls and one of them is almost three and the other one's one and a half yeah so like when you have two young kids at home you're just gonna lose battles of discipline and motivation because kids just take an unbelievable amount of energy investment you've got nothing left for yourself that's very true and so we've got to think about how can we change the way in which you talk to yourself that is a why we're calling absolutely we're talking to so why don't we start by telling can you tell me a little bit about how long you've been judging yourself ever since I can remember okay so what do you remember like when you were let's say like in middle school um middle school I wanted to be part of like the popular kids group uh-huh and I did my best to socialize with those people but I could never really find common ground with them uh-huh and I kind of figured that they just didn't like me okay and so did you think this is gonna sound so the first thing to think about is that you you tried to be something so did you try really hard to get them to like you at the time I probably thought I tried really hard but looking back I don't think I did I think when I met rejection I just kind of withdrew from the whole thing okay I didn't really put a lot of effort after that uh-huh and and what do you think it was that make you withdrew withdraw I'm not sure how to handle rejection okay I it makes me have a worse self-judgment and I don't know how to reconcile that I don't know how to accept rejection okay I'm gonna just think about that for a second okay so this is gonna sound kind of weird but are you sure you don't accept rejection too much I guess that's a possibility right so if you're telling me that when when someone rejects like let me let me put it to you this way like let's say that I go to a used car salesman and the used car salesman says hey I'd like you to buy this car and I say no if that person doesn't accept rejection what are they gonna do I'm still fight for you to buy that even though you've said no exactly but what I'm hearing you say is that you actually don't do that right when when they turn away what you're actually saying is that when they shut you down you don't try hard enough so in a bizarre way it sounds to me like you actually accept rejection way too easily I never thought about that but yeah how does that feel when I say that like does that resonate is that what could be going on it's a definitely a new idea and yes it does resonate okay so now like so this is why people don't move forward because their conception of what's wrong with them is actually wrong because good diagnosis precedes good treatment and so here you are saying that you don't accept rejection easily enough but I think like the problem here is that you accept it too easily and that's what traps you you see that yeah and so what we have to teach you how to do is actually do the very thing so if you think that you're running a certain play but you're actually running an opposite play if you think you're playing a passing game do you watch football okay do you understand about it to follow you okay so like if I think I'm running a passing game but I'm actually running a running game and that's not working like what I need to do is like get like improve my passing game but you're does that make sense like you're actually you're you think you're doing the thing that you're not doing so no wonder it's not working because you think you're doing something entirely different yeah right so yeah weird so now we get to a real question right so which is why do you accept rejection so easily so if we talk about confidence now this is making sense because the problem here is that when someone rejects you you take you you value their opinion over what you feel yourself does that make sense yes are you getting emotional I get emotional when I talk about this stuff yes what are you feeling that what you're saying is the truth and it's hard to accept what's hard to accept about it that I don't value myself enough absolutely right so that's beautiful I mean not it's not beautiful that you don't value yourself enough what I think is beautiful it's like I don't have to explain the to you right so here I in my mind I had started out with this kind of whole map of like getting you to the conclusion that you don't value yourself as much as you need to but you figure that power part out all on your own yeah I do that a lot you do what you figure things out on your own good yeah makes our life easy makes my life easy I do a lot of self-introspection and try to understand why I do the things that I do but you know if I was thinking that I was doing one thing and I'm doing another it makes a lot of sense well I could figure this one out on my own yeah and so I want you to be really careful here because when you're not able to figure things out on your own you're probably judging yourself for not being able to fix yourself yeah right all the time and that in turn makes you feel more and more like a piece of shit which in turn makes it easier for you to be rejected because deep down you don't believe that you're worthy of being accepted yep now what are we going to do about that yeah consider this this uh new information and gotta put some kind of action into play in here about incorrect incorrect incorrect we're not gonna action is not where you're you're you're going wrong jessica okay right like where you're going wrong is like so you're hurt you don't have confidence in yourself so let me ask you a question so you have a three-year-old right boy or girl yes two girls okay so you've got a three-year-old girl when she has a problem with confidence what do you do do you implement an action plan to build her confidence um well we really haven't had any issues with that that i've seen just yet but i think what i would do would be just to sit down and talk to her about what's going on and why she feels that way yeah and you know what that's probably not what you do to yourself what i guess is that you tell yourself hey i need to be more confident and i need to get my fucking shit in order and and i need to stop feeling this way and i need to implement actions to change the person that i am how would that work with your kid she wouldn't understand what i was telling her yeah and so i think what you need to learn is like how to talk to yourself and instead of like being you know instead of being so corrective be a little bit compassionate yeah are you nice to yourself okay so i could ask you why aren't you nice to yourself but i don't think that's actually a productive question i'm gonna ask you a different question instead instead when did you learn and this can be hard to answer so we can you know i can ask this a bunch of ways when did you learn that you're not worth being nice to that is a kind of a long story there we go so let's hear it i might be able to condense it so it's not no wait a whole hour we don't need to condense it just start okay see like let me pause for a second so i want to point something out to you so when you say that you want to condense it that's the problem like you're not letting yourself like you're saying that my story needs to be condensed you're not accepting what the actual like you're like what you need to do in that moment is not condense it right you need to you need to accept like who you are fully and that the reason you are this way is like long and complicated and that like cliff notes is not like there's a part of you that says oh i need to do the cliff notes version because everyone else you know i'm not worth their time and we have more important things to talk like you see how you're doing that it's so fucking it's automatic like oh like the cliff notes version because i'm not worth it like i'm not worth the full hour i need to condense things so that we can move on to the action plan it's so it's so automatic it's like insidious because it's become your default programming so we're going to stop right there and i want you to notice that when you like try to condense it what you're actually doing is like invalidating yourself okay so let's hear the long version um my parents got divorced when i was little i would say probably five or six i'm not sure about the type frame on that but my dad got remarried 98-ish i think i was 10 or 11 and uh middle school actually about that time i started noticing some different things when we would visit my dad on the weekend uh like i would have just gotten out of the shower at mom's house get ready to go to dad's house and get the card first thing he says to me is you you need to get the shower as soon as we get there my hair is still wet why do i need to get the shower we get there we can't sit on the furniture i have a stepsister who lived with them but she can sit on the furniture she can come upstairs out of the the designated playroom or play area that they had but my brother and i we had to stay down there i would want to go to school dances in junior high we weren't i wasn't allowed to do that if i still wanted to go to dad's house because it was his time i was interested in religion at a very early age and i got interested in more alternative religions and brought that to him and the biggest memory about that conversation that i have is you're going to hell because i'm not interested in the same things that he's interested in he would call and i actually stopped going to his house after a while because there were just so many small little things that ended up just piling up like this and i would tell him i'm not i'm not coming i'm not coming to your house so he would call and we would try to have these phone conversations to figure out why i don't want to go to his house anymore and they would go nowhere he would say things like well you don't have any opinions of your own they're all your mother's opinions i'm the adult you're the child you need to do what i say sort of thing my mom you know she'd sit there with me while i have these conversations on the phone with dad she'd do her best to just be there for me and then after these conversations were over she you know i understand what's going on here you you probably should still go to your dad's but she would never force me to do anything like that because she she could see what was happening my brother still went to my father's house and i'm not sure what his time was like when he was there but after a while my mom told me that when he was there dad would just be like well why isn't your sister coming over my brother and i have a terrible relationship we are civil to each other we show up at family events but we're we're not close at all there's there's no want to be close either like neither one of us really want to go further and try to be closer i uh i to this day i don't have a want to have a relationship with my father i will answer his phone calls um talk about whatever it is he's called to talk about i don't do holidays with him and my daughter turned one in june we had a small birthday at our house i did not call to invite him and i did not feel guilty about that it felt like a relief i don't have a want to be closer to him i have a want to figure out how to just be okay with what happened yeah so damn jessica thank you so much there's so much there i imagine twitch chat is exploding right now but i can't see them so that's probably good so and you shouldn't watch him either no watching twitch i'm not good so jessica my first question i'm going to ask kind of weird questions okay so the first thing that i want to point out is like do you feel so why don't you feel guilty for treating your dad the way that you do um because i did feel guilty about it for a long time because you know he's your dad you should be close to your dad and i i think i i did try for a little while to figure out how to make some type of relationship work but it just stressed me out it made me feel worse it never made me feel better so i don't give it that effort anymore beautiful so if you want to think i'm sorry did you want to say something else i was going to say that um something that i didn't really talk about is uh another thing that he would say to me my stepmother is by racial he would tell me that i don't want to come over because i'm racist he would say things like that as well and i actually tried to have a direct conversation with her a little over a year ago i have the conversation on my phone still and i don't know how to explain it other than she still wanted to treat me like i was 12 years old and that everything that i did was wrong and she had no fault of her own and anything that happened and i asked my father to read that conversation and i asked him if we could have a discussion about the things that we talked about and the way that i feel about what happened and he told me that he can't fix what's in the past so he doesn't want to talk about it so wow what do you think about that that was kind of a a reinforcement on the fact that i don't need to give it effort if i'm not going to get anything from it okay so i want to say something so i think your road forward actually comes from your current relationship with your dad because in a weird way like even though you're doing things like so just think about this your self-judgmental self-critical nature tends to latch on to all kinds of stuff to make you feel like a piece of shit and when it comes to the way that you treat your dad i would think that the self-judgmental part of you has plenty of ammo to be self-critical of you with the way that you treat your dad now right yeah but you but it doesn't you see that so that's actually true north for us that's your solution if you can understand what has happened in your mind to accept your relationship with your dad and not feel guilty about it because you're not self-critical even though you're on paper doing things that a lot of people would think would be like not treating your dad well like not inviting to his grandkids first birthday party on paper that's something that feels like neglectful and mean but it isn't and more importantly you don't trick yourself into thinking it isn't so you actually feel confident and accept yourself even though on paper that behavior can be perceived as bad right right so like do you see how that's our kernel of confidence all we have to do is understand like how did you get to that place with your dad and if we can understand how you got to that place and we can duplicate it then you're going to be fine does that make sense yeah it does okay so um now i'm going to ask you so um now i'm going to ask you so you said earlier that like there were a lot of these things that piled up with your dad right you mentioned that like even though you had just showered like he wouldn't let you sit on furniture yes he wouldn't let you go to school dances he thinks you're racist um so what do you when you say all of that stuff piled up what is it there that's piling up um it was kind of like little messages that you're uh you're not worth my love yeah so jessica now i'm going to ask you a question when you're self-critical to when you when you beat yourself up is there some sentiment that you are not worth your own love i don't know how does it feel when you beat yourself up um i don't really know how to answer that okay so let's do this why don't you tell me a little bit about how so this is the barrier right like this is the barrier of our understanding so we've come to a point where we're like we're not going to be able to answer that question so let's just say the barrier of our understanding so we've come this far and i think you're doing fantastic by the way um and i can see that we're bringing up a lot of very raw feelings for you how are you holding up actually let me ask you that first um i'm okay because it's not like this hasn't happened before okay i'm trying to uh remain a little bit in control so we can still talk okay i appreciate that and also if you don't want to remain in control that's fine too okay um and you know we can pull the plug anytime you want to so i i don't you know just let me know where your you know where your limit is but now let me so tell me a little bit about like give me an example of like how you're critical towards yourself or something that you judge yourself for um i'm actually a student at school currently as well okay so that's insane yeah but i i do really well at school actually and i'm not surprised very important that i do really well and if i do less than well i i could beat myself up about that why is it important that you do well because when i started school i was actually started college i was 17 oh wow uh but i didn't do well then okay i i didn't go i didn't follow through on assignments i withdrew from classes tried again another semester it was just the same cycle over and over again so i want to succeed this time okay i like i know i can succeed and i don't want to go back into that old pattern okay okay so when i'm not doing well it's like you don't want to you don't want to fall back you've got to pick it up you got to do better instead of me like like a 4.0 in a class is not that important it's okay if you get a 90 and not 100 like part of me knows this but i don't think i allowed myself to do that okay and what happens when you get a let's say a 90 or heaven forbid an 88 i don't write um i try to figure out what i did wrong and what i could have done better and make sure that that doesn't happen on the next assignment okay there's not i don't spend a lot of time being like oh you're stupid i don't do that it's just so there's not a lot of focus yeah so this feels this feels um like it's in the wrong direction actually to me okay like the sentiment that i'm getting from your college experience seems like the emotions that are tied up there have to do with your performance when you were 17 and like fixing that mistake this feels like it's very different from like what your dad made you feel like okay it also feels like relatively balanced to me like do you think that the way that you beat yourself up over college is like a problem or you think you do a pretty good job with it i don't think it's a problem i just couldn't really think of any examples other than that that was the first thing okay so i think i think once again it sounds to me like you're actually doing pretty well there yeah like you kind of screwed up like you're sort of proactive and you're telling me that you don't beat yourself up when you get an 88 therefore it's not what we're looking for right like because we're talking about when you beat yourself up so um and it's okay like so it's great that you shared that example so like a lot of times you know when we're talking about things we sort of like it's going to take us some time to find what we're looking for and it was really bizarre that you went right to it you know in the first five minutes like that's awesome but we can't accept expect that kind of success going forward so what's something else that you beat yourself up for um okay um for the longest time i i didn't have friends i didn't try to have friends so i've made sure to do things like a story time with my kids so they have some sort of socialization even though that whole thing makes me uncomfortable okay and when i when i don't do that with them well they're going to be just like you and you can't let that happen that sort of thing okay i think now we're getting to it so when you say they're going to be just like you what does that you what does that mean what are you like jessica i don't know how to talk to people uh-huh and what kind of person doesn't know how to talk to people um the first thing i said was not a very good one what do you mean by that someone that knew how to talk to people is a better person someone who knows how to socialize with people and so you're afraid that your kids are going to end up like what isolated not know how to relate to the world okay and you feel like you're isolated and you don't know how to relate to the world most of the time yes and what do you think it it like so this is going to sound kind of weird but there are all kinds of reasons why people will be isolated and not be able to relate to the world why do what's the reason that you're not able to do it probably because i accepted too much rejection and just kind of let that feed the feeling that i needed to be isolated this isn't okay so i'm going to stop you you're not allowed to use anything that i tell you okay okay like i hate it when people give me the right answer so like this is this is the part of you that's like coming up with the right like that's a cognitive answer i'm asking you like like there's a part of you that feels like you're just not okay with the rest of the world right right like tell me about that part don't spoon feed me my own bullshit okay i mean you're right but let's step away from that right so like what like why do you feel like let's say one year ago or let's actually go back to when you said that you haven't had a whole lot of friends for for a while let's say like four years ago did you have friends okay uh one okay why didn't you feel like you had a whole like did you have no friends at one point i've had steadily i've had one friend that we've been close with off and on and i guess i could kind of see people that you know they go out with their friends on the weekend i never did that sort of thing i was i was never really interested in the things that they would do like go to bars and whatnot yeah that wasn't my thing and i guess i just never found somebody that was interested in the same type of things that i was when i was interested in them i never found somebody who i had common ground with and i thought that that meant there was something wrong with me yeah and what did tell me about that feeling um it made me not want to socialize because if there's something wrong with me then who would want to talk with me sort of thing so i want you to notice something that's going on right now right so you're you're using some amount of cognition to rationalize like good reasons why you weren't able to make friends like you just weren't interested in going out and getting hammered you know and most of the people who you were hanging out with were interested in going out and getting hammered that makes perfect sense and every time you say something like that it moves away from the feeling that like some part of you felt like you just weren't worth getting to know right you see that yeah and and so i can also see that your your facial expression has changed you seem calmer to me now so it makes me calmer to try to rationalize things absolutely right so what do you do like tell me about that how like how does rationalizing help you stay calm my emotions can be very turbulent turbulent yep and in the past i've gotten so caught up in them that they they've led me to some pretty bad places yeah like what i uh had a problem i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and about that time with my diagnosis i had a lot of suicidal ideation so i guess it's been kind of like a i want to say a coping mechanism but i'm not sure how to express it beautiful you mean rationalized thinking yeah yeah try to we call that it yep we call that a defense mechanism yeah there you go so but let me ask you something um i have a couple questions for you jessica so do you do you feel like the judgment that so the self-judgmental part of you and i want you to kind of envision that like so you're like i think there's a part of you that recognizes that you're an awesome and wonderful person that true yes and then there's this other part of you that thinks that you're a piece of shit yes so let me ask you something does that person that thinks you're a piece of shit is that rooted in emotion or rooted in rationality emotion absolutely right so i want you i want you and other people to kind of understand this that like what happens is that part of your mind hijacks your rational thinking it's like there's like a rational part of your mind that knows that you're a good person but when those emotions rise up they like bully your rational mind and they say hey i feel like a piece of shit and i want you to give me a thousand reasons why i'm a piece of shit and then your mind starts thinking those thoughts does that make sense yes but the root is emotion and i think this is where like the crazy thing here is that jessica i think you were taught you're not like mentally ill you were taught that you're like like this is important to understand you were taught that you're not worth it right do you see that like this is a lesson that you learned because when we're kids and we're growing up we learn all kinds of things that are not like we learn all kinds of things that are not like information that are not like state capitals and mathematics yeah our parents give us a sense of value in like who we are and and right now i imagine that you're an amazing parent yeah yeah right yeah and like how long does it take when your three-year-old starts crying how long does it take to calm her down it depends on the situation but not very long usually like how long are we talking a couple minutes really a couple minutes i would say like five minutes tops tops can you calm her down in less than two minutes usually yeah yeah like i would be surprised if actually i wouldn't be surprised if half the time you calmed her down in less than 60 seconds yeah like 60 seconds of crying is a lot right it is yeah yeah so i think actually i would i would be i wouldn't be surprised if all like you calmed her down in 30 seconds and that tells me that you're actually doing an amazing job at being a mother because kids who get calmed down are kids that are secure yeah and so when mom tells me everything is going to be okay like she has faith in you and she wouldn't have that faith in you like kids don't have faith in in like bad parents right like the reason that they have faith in you is because like they know that when you say everything is okay actually everything ends up okay and 99 percent of the time everything ends up okay so she has faith in you and that means you're doing an awesome job it's something called secure attachment you can like do a google scholar search but i would guess that your kid my my degree that i'm getting is child development oh perfect so like your kids have i think they have very secure attachment yeah and so i think you're an awesome person and you're giving you're instilling them a sense of confidence and what they're learning like is that they're a good person that the world like makes sense right whereas what you learn from your dad is that the world is a confusing place and that actually like you don't have a voice and you're not like a good person right right that you can take a shower and he tells you like you're you're fucking not allowed to sit in furniture right like if you think about one of the things that makes like you know that that feels to me like he's making you feel subhuman yeah like you know i wasn't alive when civil rights was like a big thing back in the 60s but i can imagine that when you're a human being and you were told that you're not allowed to drink at one water fountain you have to drink it a different water fountain like it makes people feel subhuman and when i hear the way that your dad treated you it makes me feel like he treated you in a subhuman way and when you beat yourself up i think it there's a part of you that lives you know a part of you that learned that you were subhuman and you can and that that emotion is there and you can argue against it all you want to but that emotion doesn't give a fuck does that make sense because when it starts to hijack your rational reasoning like it's like a tidal wave and you can try to put up whatever kind of like you can try to you know blow or splash towards the tidal wave as much as you want to but it's not going to stop it and it doesn't fucking work right right so now the question becomes how how do you fix this what do you think i have no idea how do you help your child feel like a human being i talk to her like she matters yeah do you talk to yourself like you matter yes there we go right remember when i said like the school is not that's not the right example because i think that's a good example of what you're doing right when you're when you feel guilty for not inviting your dad to your daughter's first birthday party how do you talk to yourself i didn't feel guilty for that yeah i didn't feel guilty for that yeah i didn't feel guilty for that yeah i didn't feel guilty for that yeah i didn't feel guilty for that yeah right so and this is the key thing i think you did feel guilty and i think you talk to yourself like you mattered and what you actually told yourself was that hey on paper i know that i should i should invite him but like he's an asshole and i don't want him to be a part of my daughter's life and like you talk to yourself like you matter right like in that moment you matter to yourself and your opinion matters and what you believe matters and the love that you have for your child matters more than his feelings and in a weird way like in the same way that it's instinctive for you to beat yourself up it's actually instinctive sometimes for you to treat yourself like you matter like when you get into a fight with your with your husband and i'm assuming you're married to man but when you get into a fight with your husband and like he's in the wrong how do you talk to yourself we don't have many arguments okay um i'm trying to think of an example yeah so actually you don't have to because i think that's telling right so there's like there's a chance that the reason that you guys don't have arguments is because you know like it's a very like pat like you're not willing to argue with him or he's not willing to argue with you like maybe one of you guys has like there's a big power dynamic and you guys don't want to pick a fight but i'd guess the reason that you don't have arguments with him is because you actually advocate and when you talk to him you treat yourself like you matter and you make sure that he understands that yes and like that's that's your answer you're already doing it in some dimensions of your life but there there's a part of you that that you don't you don't treat yourself like that right like so when it comes to your when it comes to your kids when it comes to school when it comes to your current relationship with your dad and when it comes to your relationship with your husband you treat yourself like you matter but there are other things other feelings that you have where you feel like you're a piece of shit and what you do is you try to bully that part right you fight against it you say oh you shouldn't feel that way but my guess is that when your daughter is not feeling well you never tell her you shouldn't feel that way no right what do you tell her um try to talk about the situation like you said it's it's going to be okay yeah but when yourself now now here's the here's the punch line jessica when you're self-critical towards yourself do you ever tell yourself does the thought it's going to be okay ever enter your mind no absolutely right what enters your mind is a fucking action plan you're not okay but if you were to do these things you'll be okay in the future that's not what you tell your daughter you don't tell her you have to do x y and z and then things will be okay you tell her have faith in yourself things are going to be okay no matter what we'll figure this out i'm here with you that's what you tell her but that's not what you tell yourself and if you can learn how to tell yourself that then you're going to be fine so good sigh how you feeling right now that i'm glad i prepared my desk with tissues yeah i'm feeling like we're getting somewhere yeah yeah you look a little bit lighter yeah it's weird how that feels right that's good though yeah it's very good it means we're getting somewhere yeah you have any thoughts or questions at this point okay i had a thought yeah i'll share it i thought about making a sign for my desk that you know it's going to be okay and just kind of putting it up there what do you think about that what do you think about it sounds like a good idea to me okay then right yeah i think the one thing i would caution you about is watch out for the judgment even with that so in a weird way what i what i what i can foresee happening is that you look up at the sign and you say oh i used to believe that but now i don't anymore and you can judge yourself for like does that make sense yes you can even judge yourself for like not believing the sign and you're like you can even tell yourself oh i used to be on the right path but fuck look at where i got myself now so watch out for that okay so i think that that sign can be wonderful and inspiring and at the same time you should maybe tack a smaller sign which is that if that's not how i'm feeling right now that's okay too i like that you get that yeah it makes me think of my husband when we were dating he made a sign that's actually hanging up in our house it was uh the plan you know get married have kids graduate get jobs happily ever fucking afters what it says on the bottom of it it just makes me think of that yeah absolutely because it's that last part right it's not the plan it's the whatever yeah the whatever at the bottom and that's what you need to learn how to do for yourself yeah concretely i think if you're not seeing a therapist you should really think about it i do okay great perfect yeah yeah well i mean i'm gonna say that maybe we should go ahead and and stop because i think this is a great place to stop how do you feel i agree okay well thanks for coming on jessica i'm gonna um thank you very much and strong work today
