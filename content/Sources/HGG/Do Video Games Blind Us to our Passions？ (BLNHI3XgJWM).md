 Yeah, so any chance that playing a lot of video games blinds us to our passions? Absolutely. So here's the key thing that a video game does. It does not cause you to internalize or introspect at all. What video games do is they take your mind and they externalize it towards a particular thing and they keep it occupied over here without any effort for like a period of hours. And so there's no sense of like internal exploration with a video game. All it is is like that straight dope and menergic stuff without like any of the other stuff. That's part of the reason that we're getting disconnected from our passions because we don't know how to look within anymore. I'm not saying they're bad. I like them too. I play. I played Lost Ark yesterday. That's okay.
