 I recently joined forces with the daily wire in a new venture they call daily wire plus The plan is to build a multimedia empire offering services on the philosophical educational journalistic and entertainment front Including movies TV shows and media for children and an empire that will not fall prey to the woke Authoritarianism that has become increasingly mandatory in so many places including let's say the once great Disney Why did I decide to do this and what does daily wire plus offer? First I like working with Ben Shapiro and his crew Shapiro and I have some great plans to undertake things together that we could not do easily apart We're gonna run a seminar on Exodus for example in late July Bringing together the smartest and most articulate people we both know to run through that book in an attempt to enlighten ourselves And others and prepare me to do another biblical series in the same vein as the Genesis productions of 2017 then we're going to Israel to do something similar there with the holy sites of Judaism Christianity and Islam in April and May of next year We're planning to tour Eastern Europe to talk with political and cultural leaders there particularly about the legacy of communism and their well-grounded fears of the resurgence of such ideas in the West and that's Not all second. I like the unabashedly shameless Capitalist ethos of the daily wire crew. They made me a great deal financially one that offers me essentially unlimited creative freedom and Opportunity and still means that I can use YouTube as I have been to offer free content to a worldwide audience I've always deemed myself an evil capitalist I run my own businesses on a for-profit basis with few exceptions Learning through hard experience that the discipline imposed by the necessity of pleasing an audience on an ongoing basis Is a plus not a minus Third I have been working in isolation for a long time essentially since departing from the university I've had a very good team of people around me, but we can only do so much well concentrating on producing high quality educational and journalistic content and having a professional crew of several hundred people available to handle logistics filming production travel editing distribution marketing and Merchandising is a non-trivial advantage Fourth it was prudent to protect myself and the intellectual property I have produced and will continue to produce I Was just banned from Twitter Synchronistically so to speak the same day. I partnered with the daily wire YouTube and I are getting along for now Although their lack of transparency on the algorithm front is worrisome But God only knows when I will say something that the invisible powers that be Including some that are artificially intelligent nature will decide that they've heard enough from the reprehensible magic super nazi There are more reasons, but that's a good start I would like to also let everyone watching and listening know that I have pored over the details of this arrangement for months and Thank you to my daughter Michaela and her husband Jordan Fuller For attending so carefully to the details of this and that we are thrilled with the outcome and ready to go forward No holds barred to subscribe Go to dailywireplus.com You will have immediate access to the new projects that we have posted including a new miniseries Dragons monsters and men that I recorded as the kickoff for the DW plus project dailywireplus has 890,000 subscribers Netflix has 200 million DW plus is not woke is Netflix Decide that for yourself But give some consideration to supporting this new joint venture and help us continue educating and informing and Battling on the side of tradition in the raging culture war go if you would to dailywireplus.com To subscribe that's dailywireplus.com And if you haven't yet done so and you feel like doing it hit the subscribe button on my youtube channel Thanks very much all of you
