 Hey dad. Hey Mick. Fancy meeting you here. Yeah, fancy seeing you here too. Well this might not be the most fun conversation but I thought before we delve into how awful this is I thought I could just read a brief background I wrote about what's been going on so people are caught up to speed. Is that okay? Yep. Okay. The gist of it is it looks like your license is getting taken away but starting from the beginning the College of Psychologists of Ontario a regulatory board that was formed to monitor psychologists relationships with their clients mainly has been after you for is it three years or is it longer than that? It depends on the waves but for this issue it's been three or four years yeah. So working professionals like doctors, lawyers, massage therapists even are all overseen by regulatory boards. What regulatory boards are supposed to do is give clients who've been basically abused by working professionals a place to go to to complain to. What happened to you is a bunch of people who weren't your clients random people online from all over the world complained about a number of your tweets as well as comments you made on Joe Rogan. The sorry not beautiful tweet in reference to a extremely obese swimsuit model. A tweet criticizing the government of Canada. A tweet saying that physicians removing women's breasts for being trans was criminal and one I thought fairly entertaining tweets suggesting that this is the tweet that people online are saying you were inciting suicide which honestly I think you'd have to have the IQ of a beetle in order to think that but anyway you responded to someone who thought the world's population was too high and suggested that he should include himself in the depopulation he was already suggesting. The college basically took all those complaints and decided that you pose a moderate risk to the public and I quote the tweets were undermining public trust in the profession of psychology and trust in the college's ability to regulate the profession in the public interest. So completely ignoring the fact that one morbid obesity should not be encouraged as it kills people. Removing your breasts and sterilizing yourself should not be encouraged and I'm not even sure why we'd have to explain that criticizing the government should be protected and sarcasm is a form of humor. They decided you have to undergo re-education which you fought back against and lost and appealed and lost because in my opinion the court system in Canada is full of woke judges so there was no winning there and now you're basically in a position where you either undergo re-education which won't work because you won't get turned woke or I don't lose your license you don't know. You never know this time next year man it's pink hair and away we go on the radical leftist side. Yeah. No you don't think so. I don't think so. So that's that's the overview so I guess we could start with like how are you feeling about all this? I think you were insulting to Beatles. What have they ever done to you Michaela? Okay anyways. Yeah so are you okay? It's tiring you know like I'm preparing for this tour. I have a I'm finishing up two books they're very complicated they take pretty much all my attention and having to fight this war well it's tiring you know I have to plot strategize write watch my tongue consider my next best move and I also have to face the dismal reality that as I wrote in the National Post in Canada's National Post this week that in some real fundamental sense Canada's Charter of Rights isn't worth the paper it's written on and likely professionals in this country can say goodbye to their right to express themselves politically or otherwise politically or professionally. I don't think that my tweets some of my tweets were political in a sense in that I was criticizing certain government figures Councilman Trudeau's former Chief of Staff and Justin the WAF puppet himself and I suppose you could argue that those were political opinions and fair enough but I have the right to my political opinions. The tweets that I really got criticized for particularly the one regarding Page or Page or however he or she wants to be referred to I also regarded that as a professional obligation because I think it's incumbent on psychologists with an ounce of integrity to point out the danger of self of having self-deluded narcissistic self-destructive celebrities parade their proclivity to self sterilize and self mutilate as a public good on their public forums so I don't regret any of that and I certainly you know me Michaela I can feel guilty at the drop of a hat it's actually one of my outstanding features and I've scoured my conscience with regards to these accusations and the best I can do is to find them grimly amusing it this is so ridiculous I mean the fact that the college accepted a complaint that was the entire transcript of my three-hour discussion with Joe Rogan pretty much says it all and by the way on the climate front just so that everyone is crystal clear about this I think the climate models that are used to justify the encroaching tyranny plan by the WF are 100% untrustworthy and I think that the notion that we should let people terrify us to death with notions of an impending climate apocalypse so that we have to be locked down in every possible manner give up our automobiles give up our private give up our flights private or otherwise give up our right to buy clothing give up our right to eat give up our right to keep grandma warm or cool in the summer let's say it's like no sorry no wrong in every possible way and more and more people are waking up to that realization you know some of these tweets are now two years old I think they've aged remarkably well personally and so I just I don't see where the crime is here man I think the crime would have been holding my tongue so and you know you asked me how I'm doing it's like this didn't really come as a surprise so I'd already prepared for it and as you and I spoke about last night and I've talked over with Tammy too and with Julian my son for you know to some degree we're going to see what good we can make arise from this and if this is my opportunity to further expose the machinations of the radical left narcissistic resentful woke mob then bring it on boys we saw what happened to Claudine Gay we saw what happened to the president of UPenn if the good people at the Ontario College of Psychologists think they're immune from such things they have another think coming so you know and maybe I'm wrong I'm not wrong about the damn tweets you know I might be wrong about how this is gonna unfold but even there the worst thing they can do to me is take my license now they're definitely planning to do that because the rule is I have to be educated by people of their choice at my expense for whatever length of time they deem suitable until by their standards I've learned whatever the hell lesson I'm supposed to learn and I can't even imagine what that lesson would be it's like what don't tweet don't speak don't think don't tell my clients the truth so I don't know how to learn that lesson I don't know how they're gonna measure whether or not I've learned it I don't know they're gonna get to measure it I have no idea who they're gonna get to teach me I guess we're gonna find out I would like to find out oh very curious about that person and so I'm set up for failure and you know my detractors will say well dr. Peterson you say yourself up for failure you know whatever but those are the Beatles I was referring to yeah yeah yeah I know I know and well I don't think I've set myself up for failure I wouldn't say the evidence so far suggests that I have and so you know it's so much of its preposterous one of the things I asked the college they never answered I asked them 40 questions in a letter of this level of impossibility so one of them was all right so you got about a dozen complaints maybe they got like 17 complaints and decided to proceed with 13 something like that from people from all over the world detailing out the my crimes as we discussed many of those complainants claimed falsely in writing to be clients of mine by the way which didn't invalidate their opinions apparently none of them just to be clear about this none of the more clients of mine or new clients of mine or were anyone I commented about on Twitter or knew anyone I commented about on Twitter so we want to be clear about that and I can't see how this can play out in any other way then I take the course it doesn't work because it's set up not to work then they take my license okay now what's the consequence of me losing my license well it's annoying you know because those are hard licenses to get and I worked very hard to earn and deserve that license and to maintain it and also very hard at being a good therapist which I was there were no complaints taken about against me by anyone until I became known in the public sphere you know so that's a good thing to consider and I'm not that happy about the prospect of the woke beetles that you described having their way with my professional credentials it annoys me deeply now on the other hand I'm not dependent on that license anymore I have other tricks up my sleeve so to speak anyways and at some point I'm going to determine that being a member of their pathetic little incestuous ideologically addled resentment ridden bureaucratic pea-brained micro-sold club is not worth the effort and I suppose we're probably there already but I have something to do publicly you know in my delusion and like I said maybe I'm wrong and I should just shut the hell up and but my sense grandiose though it may be is that these bloody colleges regulatory boards they pose a major threat to the free speech and free thought of all Canadians not just professionals Canadians can think for themselves what sort of professional consultation are you going to be able to obtain when the people you're talking to are terrified of telling you the truth when you bring them your 13 year old daughter who's in major distress who's so concerned about her body that she's thinking about sterilizing herself and having your breasts removed and your psychologist isn't going to be able to do anything except lie to you that it's all right how's that going to go for you you think that through for like 15 seconds and if you don't think that'll happen to someone in your family soon you either don't have a family or you're diluted because it's coming your way real soon so you know I feel that I have an obligation to fight this out in the public sphere in many ways it would be simpler for me just to tell them to go directly to hell and give up my license proudly you know and not worry about this again but I don't know I'm not there yet might happen I'm not there yet will play out this farce to its end and I'll do that in the faith that if I conduct myself with a certain degree of honor and care that the results won't be precisely what my would-be enemies intend let's put it that way yeah this is this is this is what I mean luckily you're in a position where this isn't going to crush you but if this happened to somebody who didn't have multiple streams of income what would they do they just be re-educated and lie I suppose or quit well the problem with being it's not that easy to be re-educated lie I mean first of all you know it's pretty hard on your soul second you can't lie persistently without becoming corrupted you can't pretend without tilting in the direction of your pretense and so an honorable person in this situation is basically they're basically screwed like there's nothing they can really do you know because if they quit which is what they should do they should tell them to go to hell publicly and repeatedly Amy Ham the nurse in month in British Columbia she's they've tortured her to death and she was very afraid of them and she's come out swinging again so you know she's got some spine that girl did she know she did she um oppose what was going on with cove it that that's her story well she really got in trouble as I understand it for insisting that there was a biological difference between men and women which is the most basic of facts right of all facts that is the most basic if you are willing to compromise yourself on the issue of the reality of biological sex there is no lie you won't swallow and that's why we're being tempted with that particular proposition because the evil system of ideas that has the woke ideologues in its clutches has as part of its structure of implicit knowledge the certainty that if the lie of gender fluidity well let's say biological sex fluidity can be promulgated there's no limit whatsoever so you know and people they want to delay the inevitable if the woke mob comes knocking they'll kowtow and apologize and it's certainly understandable because who the hell wants to put their family's financial security at risk their professional license but you know at some point you can have a certain amount of hell now or you can have way more hell later and I've never been someone to wait around for the next wave of hell when I can just get it over with right now you know and I guess that's what accounts for whatever degree of combativeness I have it's we're gonna have a fight we're gonna have it right now and we're gonna get to the bottom of it so pleasant as though pleasant though that will be so I don't know what the sardonic part of me like there's a blackly amusing element to this it's so ridiculous that it's almost incomprehensible and so I'm curious it's like okay yep with each move that's this gets either I get more deluded or this gets darker you know depending on how you look at it I presume it's that it's that it gets darker like the rot within the Canadian the rot within Canada gets exposed more deeply I mean we've seen something similar as I said take place on the university front in the United States and you know there are lots of people jumping up and down about that like right now like Bill Ackman and Christopher Ruffo and Ruffo probably knows more than anyone else about how deep that rot goes but you know would-be Democrats like Ackman you know they're shocked by Claudine Gaye and the president of UPenn and MIT it's like if that shocked you you guys have a lot more you have a lot more devils to encounter in the next few months this is a big problem you know in Canadians I thought about this a lot for about 150 years Canadians could rest assured in the essential reliability of their fundamental institutions and maybe Canada foremost among countries in the world you know I mean arguably the Scandinavian countries were in the same league in certain European countries and the United States on a good day but Canada was pretty damn stable kind of dull little hard-on-excellence but reliable orderly stable predictable peace order and good government sort of place and like that was 1995 boys and girls and wherever the hell you are now it's not there and Canadians not only don't know that they don't want to know that but also they don't even know how to find out to know that because especially the older Canadians they're accustomed to relying on legacy news services like CBC Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to provide them with you know at least quasi valid information well forget about that like those days are gone that that ended in 2015 that's quite a while ago now so so you know let's let the comedy roll man and you know one of the things the CPO people don't understand probably don't want to understand is that I had to hold my tongue and bide my time while this legal action was proceeding and now it's like it's very dangerous to put someone in a position where they don't have anything to lose I don't have anything to lose the worst they can do and this is what they'll do is they'll take my license and then I'll be known by those who wish to foster enmity against me as now disgraced Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson but what that's going to do I believe is bring disgrace to those who levy that epithet it'll just undermine the validity of the designation itself it'll undermine public trust in the idea of psychologist in the reliability of that designation now you know that's a pretty preposterous claim but and maybe I'm wrong and if I'm wrong well I'm willing to take the punches but but there's a reason that people bought 11 million copies of my book the reason they bought 11 million copies of 12 rules for life was that they found it helpful like psychologically helpful which was its purpose there's a reason that the video interviews and lectures that I produced on YouTube and released on YouTube mostly for free not that I haven't benefited financially from all of this because I certainly have and I'm not the least bit ashamed of that fact I'm pretty happy about it and grateful for it and hope it will continue and I'm striving to make sure it does it's like there's a reason people are watching those videos and listening so we'll see whose reputation suffers hopefully I won't do anything too stupid and angry along the way and I don't think I will because I'm actually not particularly angry it's like I digested all this a long time ago I'm sad about it I'm sad for my country you know and we've talked to you moved I can move to Arizona and have a heartbeat yeah you know my son Julian he's an American he could leave lots of Canadians are moving three times as many Canadians move to the US as vice versa we're going to be the worst performing economy in the developed world for the next 30 years by the current projections really we make less money now in Canada on average than people in Mississippi and sorry for everybody in Mississippi to use you as that example but hey you're all doing better than Canadians so you can be happy about that it'd be much simpler for me just to say oh you know pack up all my troubles in the old kit bag and hit the road you know it's not like I'm not used to moving around but I don't know it's kind of interesting so and I'm I also feel a certain moral obligation do you think that you're gonna continue this battle legally well we do have one avenue there is there is one appeal route left we can appeal directly to the Supreme Court it's a very low probability maneuver and you know another loss who knows right because assume that gets rejected which is the Well then those who are not very fond of me will say to those who want to believe well you know three different levels of Canadian judiciary decided that Dr. Peterson was wrong who the hell is he to make claims that this is what an inappropriate response and look I can understand why people would believe that I would want to believe that you know that's the entire entire court system is compromised well it implies it certainly implies that you'll you'll you'll be happy to know now though that the federal court today announced that you have the right or even the obligation to reveal your pronouns when you address the court and that you also can start your whatever it is you're doing with an indigenous land acknowledgement so make of that what they want yeah they just announced that on Twitter today Arizona sounds like sounds like the right move that's my opinion yeah yeah well you have a personal stake in the matter too but I also appreciate that you know it's I'm pretty happy that you'd be happy if we move down there but you know I've got well Julian's here and he should know he plans to stay yeah well there's plenty of people thinking in that direction but for now I think we'll continue our I'll continue in the course that I've set myself on and Tammy's behind it and and you know I'm willing to play come what may you know I I already have my ducks in order with regards to my strategies I'm gonna say what I think I already care what happens like that that's not exactly it's not like I don't care that's wrong sorry that that's ill-stated there isn't anything better that could conceivably happen to me than exactly what will happen to me regardless of how it appears if I am careful and state the truth I

either because I have some pretty damn good researchers on my staff and we're doing some remarkable things at a rate that was like a hundred times faster than anything I could do in the university like I don't think in some sense I haven't lost anything like I had to change I'm not a full-time practicing professor anymore although I'm still a professor of emeritus so I have that designation I don't have a clinical practice but I'm kind of practicing on a global stage that's not an over that's not an exaggeration I don't have a university but I'm building one that's kind of interesting so not there's nothing in it that hasn't been gained apart from a certain amount of stress but you know what are you gonna have a life without stress I don't think you're not worrying about something big that's real you're gonna worry about something that's small and delusional so you can forget the whole stress-free thing you wouldn't even want that if you could have it you know people are way too ordinary and unreasonable to want a stress-free existence you know you hear people say I just want to be happy it's like oh just that's all you want is to be like walking around in a cloud of delight 100% of the time and then they say just as if that's the easiest thing in the world for anyone to imagine and manage it's like no definitely not do you think like is there so I've been talking about this a bit on my Instagram and people have reached out and said is there anything I can do to help but yeah okay sure paper would be best but if you have to do it electronically do it electronically sure you know that's how you will we'll link that then in the description for anybody who's sure I still think it's all like you're doomed your license was gone I guess soon as you became famous in 2017 like it wasn't gonna be there which you said to yourself I think in 2016 or 2017 that speaking out like this is going to I mean you were a bit more doomsday about it something about lose you your career but well I lost my professorship essentially it just became impossible people might be curious about that you know I couldn't figure out if I could go back to the university for quite a long time and it certainly would have been uncomfortable to do so given the woke direction of all educational institutions but I think I could have gone back and made peace with my colleagues it's not like I didn't fundamentally get along with them you know but I realized once I recovered and could think clearly that I couldn't take graduate students anymore I couldn't train researchers because one of the things you're hoping if you train researchers is that they go off to be professors and I trained plenty of professors which is a high level of success for an academic researcher by the way it's one of the standards by which attainment in those fields it's judged there isn't a hope in hell that anyone who ever worked for me much less got a letter of reference from me let's say because they were my student or who even agreed to be in my lab would ever get an academic position so how could I continue as a professor and then with regards to being a clinical psychologist well first of all once things blew up around me my life was so complicated that I just didn't have the capacity free capacity necessary to concentrate as diligently on my clients welfare as would it be necessary because when you're in a clinical session with someone for an hour nothing that's about you is supposed to happen right so if you're preoccupied well that that's not good and plus you'll make a mistake especially if people are talking to you about really important things and then also I have to have free time outside of my practice to take phone calls and so forth and to drop everything at the drop of a hat in case there's an emergency you know you remember when you were growing up oh yeah how often did the phone ring in during the week from a client in a client in rough shape I was gonna bring that up during this podcast I mean I feel like there are a few clients where it might have been every day like it was really well I gave them my phone number too yeah so yeah you got to be all in if you're a psychotherapist and there's just no way I could continue with that not in good conscience you know and that was really painful because yeah I liked my clients and they liked me and you know some of them I had a relationship with that was as deep as you typically have with a family member certainly like you get to know people in a clinical environment may be better than anyone else has ever known them you know and if the thing goes well those are close relationships and so it was very painful for me and for my clients to have that all evaporate but the writing was on the wall you know and you when reality comes knocking you're a fool if you turn away regardless of what it is so and this is the same thing now it's like this looks like bad news and it's certainly bad news for other professionals and I think Canadian professionals who aren't woke themselves and who don't have their heads fully in the sand and their nether regions exposed for exploitation let's say they know this is bad news well that's the image that came to mind the other day when I was thinking about yeah I know I know yeah that's part of what happens when you let your shadow talk to you you know oh oh man yeah pretty rough man so so it's tiring you know I've been very tired this week and it's been difficult to concentrate on my book wine wine and that is a problem because it's due right away and I I suppose to the degree I am angry I'm angry because I don't like having my time stolen by dimwits who don't have anything better to do with their lives then promote the dogma of ignorant men and moralize about it I don't like that to say the least and I'm part of the reason I don't like that is because I know where it goes where it goes is not good and where Canada is going is not good it might already be that where Canada is is not good the biggest fear I have right now for the country is that true to hang on for another year because getting rid of that man is like trying to get a fly out of sticky paper yeah with all the mess that would entail and then Pierre Paulia will be elected and then we'll find out just how bad things are and that'll be dumped on his shoulders and his government will fail because of the cataclysm that he's inherited the conservatives will have a one-term shot at it and then like Mark Carney will be the new Prime Minister of Canada that's the most likely outcome and by that time Canadians will make 40% of what Americans make instead of the 60% they make now yeah yeah so you know that's that's rough and likely so maybe not but you know I have I have some of the abilities of Cassandra Cassandra was a seer who was fated to be entirely accurate in her predictions her torture was that no one ever listened to her so I don't have that problem because people do listen to me but I do have some ability to see down the road to where things are going I mean I'm optimistic fundamentally I certainly do believe that as a species we're on the cusp of we are on the cusp of a potential prosperity and realm of possibility that's unparalleled in it's unparalleled I like that better I tell you we could sure carry everything to to an unimaginable hell in a handbasket with equal ease and you know I'm hoping that we're all wise enough to pick the former route and not to engage too carelessly in the delights of the latter and you everyone can see that playing itself out I feel like another outcome could be Trump winning in America and I feel like Canada all always kind of trails behind what America does a little bit and so potentially Trump could turn around America and then Canada could follow suit after that give or take five years after or something that'd be a more you know I mean it's certainly the case that the Jewish community in the United States and Canada are waking up to the dangers of the progressive idiocy that they so foolishly by majority supported so that's a good thing certainly MIT Harvard and you Penn revealed their hand so the degree of rot in the educational institutions is becoming to be somewhat apparent even to people who are inclined not to believe it which is like everyone because who the hell wants to believe that there are certainly signs that the public has had enough of the woke nonsense especially on the green front I mean the German working class is let's put it this way not very happy we saw what happened in Argentina did you see the president went to the WAF yeah did you see yeah I did did you see AI translated version in English no no oh oh man it's good yeah the AI is really coming along we're gonna use that for Peterson Academy I think it looks like he's speaking in English and he even has it's in his voice in his accent it's really good I'll send it to you yeah okay okay yeah well he I mean he for everyone who's watching and listening I mean he went to the WAF in debt to Davos and said you guys have got the problem wrong you're the problem and that's what I think it's like top-down centralizing globalist green utopians moralizing about the poor expelling carbon while flying around the world in their jets yep they're the problem pretty obviously that's you El Gore it's interesting that they invited him I thought that was interesting it is interesting yeah yeah right enough and well and also and also good you know I mean that is one of the things that you know you have to give the devil is due they did have enough gall to invite him so and he had enough courage to speak so you know that could be worse you know and there are other things unfolding around me that are very very optimistic we're launching Peterson Academy as you pointed out the end of February and that's fun you know it's a great adventure to see if we can offer high-level university equivalent education for like 10% of the price to everyone that's a cool thing the art conference you know I started getting involved with this organization the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship which is trying to promote a vision of decentralized responsibility as the antithesis of top-down centralizing globalist green utopia slash hell and we had a lovely time at the conference it was a smashing hit we got 15,000 people at the 02 afterwards for a public event that's going great guns and it was really I really enjoy working with the people that I've been working with you know so I have a lot of reasons to be optimistic in my own life Tammy's doing well you're doing well Julian's thriving I'm not 98% dead so you know that's a good thing so the college thing is a bump in the road in some real way and also an opportunity it's an opportunity it's an annoying opportunity you know well it is an annoying opportunity but I'm doing my best to be grateful for it too because I think I do believe and we've had lots of experience like this we've already talked about this is that just because the thing that's happening to you at the moment presents a problem doesn't mean it isn't rife with opportunity and I do think that's a reflection of the old dragon gold symbolism you know it's like you have to confront a dragon to get the gold but what that also implies is that well it might look like a dragon but maybe it's a treasure house you know and we're we're sort of taking that attitude with regards to Peterson Academy and also with essay though app that I'm working on with Julian it's like nobody teaches people how to write okay well if nobody's doing it and you see that well then you could do it the universities are disintegrating okay well hey people still need to be educated and that's a better way of looking at the world is just because it looks like I don't know if there's any such thing as an opportunity that doesn't present itself as a problem it's a great way of thinking about problems it's not naive that doesn't make it easy you know if you're really having trouble with your wife and you figure out what the trouble is you could radically improve her life and your life and maybe the ability of both of you to communicate with everyone else that's a hell of a gift you know in the guise of that problem so so I'm okay tired that's the only problem you know because I was already working pretty much at a hundred percent capacity and I suppose there's some danger in that but I'm trying to finish this book and it's a really hard book and so when something like this comes along it I'm burning up energy I really don't have and there's a certain danger in that and I get a little more irritable I think I was mouthy on Twitter last night again after not being so you know for a number of months and that was a bit of a slip but and that's a danger you know and and it's one of the dangers of this sort of trial by process that I'm in at the moment is that one of the typical outcomes for people who are pinned down by responsibility less bureaucrats hiding behind the luxury of their positions is that they get pushed to the point where they do something stupid then as soon as they do something stupid you know of course they're screwed because they're tormentors jump all over them and say well we knew you were like that from the beginning and that's what we were warning everyone for that's the social justice birds voice by the way Casey we're wondering lovely yeah yeah yeah yeah dictatorship by screeching Harpy that's where we're at now right we're gonna find out what the feminine proclivity for totalitarianism is real soon we're just doing this for your own good that's no good okay well I feel like is there anything else we want people to know that pretty much sums it up and yes we could you know we could speak directly to Canadians for a moment it's like yeah if you're watching and listening this and you want to do something about it well write the Ontario College of Psychologists and let them know what you think right your member of Parliament or your federally or your member of Parliament provincially if you live in Ontario ask them what the hell's going on you know and what they think about the fact that the regulatory boards in Canada now have final say even over the Charter Rights of Canadian professionals ask them what they think that means for the rights of the typical person look guys who are watching and listening and think about it for a minute if the right to free speech and thought can be denied by my regulatory board and the courts what bloody chance do you think you have and then if that doesn't bother you enough then ask yourself this what chance do your children have you know and if you think I'm a crank and that I'm exaggerating this well fine you you're welcome to that opinion you might even be right I don't think so but you might be and you can take your chances just like everyone else but if you think I am right you better think about it because the news on the Canadian front is not good this country is in serious trouble way more than people think and the most likely outcome is exactly I think the one I described the liberals will be turfed out temporarily Pierre Poliev will take the hit by and certainly the establishment will do everything they possibly can to blame everything cataclysmic that Trudeau has been producing on Poliev that's obviously the best strategy and then we'll have another Trudeau clone some elitist intellectual even though Trudeau is by no means intellectual he has all the pretensions of an intellectual as a none of the intelligence or wisdom a certain cunning that's for sure and no shortage of self-confidence we'll get another one like him and then then it'll be time to move to Arizona okay well anything else kiddo any cautions on your part I don't think so I think we're set up pretty well I mean be careful on Twitter or X yeah I will I would be my caution be careful on yeah but um yeah and and sleep and don't get too upset or angry because it's just well it's kind of out of your it's really you're really just along for the ride here you know that's kind of true of life in general you know you're you're kind of swept along and you got to ask yourself what you want to be swept along by and I would say you want to be swept along by your relationship with God and you want to be swept along by the truth because if you're swept along by falsehood and the prince of lies you're being swept towards something so abysmal that the worst of your paranoid imagination would stretch itself beyond its capacity to imagine so it'll say what I think like I have for years and I'll pay my price whatever that is and I'll reap my rewards whatever those might be and I have confidence in the not only in the outcome but even in the process painful though it may be you know at certain moments I got lots of support you know and Tam and I are on the same page that makes a big difference and so same with you and Julie and I've got lots of support and we've been through we've been through worse than this man by a lot so and we get to see what happens you know it's not boring that's for sure it's not boring yeah okay well I think that wraps up that very nicely thanks dad good luck with everything okay bye bye
