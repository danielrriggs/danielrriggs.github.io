 The people of the world who've had experienced Eastern Europeans who had to live under the Dark umbrella of communism those who have escaped tyrannical regimes that lady you head on from South Korea But they come over here now and they see what we're doing with our freedoms Which is essentially turning them upside down and mocking them and under under the name of political correctness or woke ism insisting pushing evangelizing these toxically stupid ideas and and perverting the education system in their bay Putin and the warriors of the world as Edward Lutwock calls them. They're laughing their heads off Because they know this is a form of almost collective dimension Hello everyone, I'm here today with mr. Rex Murphy Which is always a pleasure Rex is a Canadian commentator and author primarily on Canadian political and social matters He was the regular host of CBC radio one's cross-country checkup a nationwide call-in show For 21 years before stepping down in September of 2015 He is perhaps Canada's best recognized and most admired and indeed most recognized And most admired and indeed most loved journalist pleasure to see you Rex. I'm glad we have a chance to talk again. I Think we should go over that by all part where you mentioned most loved. I think there are three dogs and two cats Yeah, well, it's hard to it's hard to believe if you're loved but but it's definitely the case So I wanted to talk to you today about the Trudeau government and just exactly what's going on I thought might give you a bit of background about exactly why I thought we should talk again so I've been traveling through the US and Europe for the last three months I think 40 cities in the US and then 14 cities in Europe and I've noticed I've talked with a lot of people about Their attitude towards Canada and how that's changed as a consequence of Trudeau and so in the US what I noticed in particular was that people whether they were Democrats or Republicans Were very unhappy with Trudeau's treatment of the trucker convoy and also Shocked I would say that he blamed it on the Americans Especially on the conservatives and also appalled that he froze bank accounts That was not a wise move and then in Europe, I would say Canada's international reputation has taken a vicious hit People are shocked I would say Again at what happened around the trucker convoy Specifically the freezing of the bank accounts But also there's a fair bit of buzz about the new bill C11 and the internet censorship And so I don't think Canadians really are aware of how vicious I hit The reputation of our country has taken under our current Prime Minister and so I thought I would talk to you about the Peculiar times that we seem to find ourselves in in Canada My sense is that we get a scandal every week and have for about six months that under normal Circumstances would be sufficient to bring down a government. Yeah Well, I'll pick you up on a couple of things before I go to the actual scandal point In reference to Canada standing either in the US or in Europe Even within the last three days with the decision Roe versus Wade Mr. Trudeau was in Rwanda Which is not near Quebec when he commented on the operations of the Supreme Judiciary of the United States and probably the most electric issue in American politics and here's what he had to say actually Brought the brought the paper with me. I'm only quoting a small bit of it here He is commenting on it. This is very important. He's commenting on the Supreme Court One-third of the constitutional government of the United States an equal party to Congress and the executive This is a prime minister in a separate country. And here's his first response to the decision The news coming out of the United States is horrific. I pause there He's not never mind the particular issue He's saying that the operation judgment determination and and rumination of a court of a judiciary of Judicature of the United States the constitutional balance part He's commenting on the operation of the essential element of government and especially on the judges and he's calling it horrific number two He goes on now. He's going to what he would call substance. My heart goes out To the millions of American women who are now set to lose their legal right to an abortion The last phrase is patently false but the biggest thing there is Who was he to play the Bill Clinton? empathizer to the constituents of another nation now if you were telling me he he's earned a bad reputation in the United States because of Blaming American right-wing authorities for Bringing money into the convoy at which was proven false The majority and by far of the money that went to the convoy came from ordinary donors in Canada But every time Trudeau has a problem in Canada He looks to look to the right wing of the United States as his convenient villain Well, what do you think he's gonna go to do now when it when the people in the United States and in the government Democrats should be pissed with this as well he's saying that the United States Supreme Court is an agency of horrific decisions and implying that they're deliberately bringing great pain to American women and Stirring up anger and I'll tap that off by pointing out one other thing. You've already had a night of rage You've had people storming the private houses of the US Supreme Court. You've had a a a An institution burnt down. You've had the legislature. I think it was in Arizona Invaded so that the police had to get well, you know If it were a reverse situation words of encouragement from an outside prime minister Saying that the decision was horrific and that is going to cause anger on an issue this hot That was grotesquely irresponsible and If we're gonna blame people's actions on public words, which is a liberal thing to do Then part of the mayhem that was we're going to see in the United States over this decision comes from encouragement From our dilettante prime minister here in Canada. Well, I also don't understand it strategically in some real sense because it looks self-evident that the Democrats are going to face a catastrophic electoral defeat in the fall and that means that the Trudeau government Assuming it lasts the next two or three years that it's hypothetically likely to last is going to be dealing with a much more conservative ally on the southern front and the steps taken to alienate all those people especially after he also blamed the maggot type Republicans for funding the trucker convoy to destabilize Canadian democracy Just doesn't seem like the most diplomatic or wise thing to do when you're dealing with people who are well Crucial to us on the trading front. Let's say and not say nothing of defense Well, one thing you don't look for in the pronouncements of Trudeau is wisdom That's a ridiculous effort to begin with and it will give you no results whatsoever what you should look for and which is given evidence of Over the last seven years that what he might lack in intellectual sweep He more than compensates by a certain instinct of cunning and the reason for slamming role versus Wade Is that he thinks he's found yet another issue Even though it's in another country and even though the judicial determinations of the US Supreme Court have no valence or relevance to Canadians nonetheless, it's the kind of as Yeah, he calls it's kind of raw meat to use an expression He likes a lot when he applies it to the concern kind of raw meat you throw out. I found it even more annoying That here you are in Rwanda on your way to a castle in Bavaria Being being hit by this RCMP scandal and you got to jump out of your chair Three minutes after the Supreme Court decision is announced to let the world know you think their deliberation was horrific to stir up the already angry hard leftists in the United States and Detract from any attention being paid to issues in Canada like inflation gasoline prices food prices the closing of parliament, but I won't go on with those until we get to them Let's start with the issue of the strange political times that we seem To be in in Canada and perhaps touch on the collusion of the NDP and the media in producing that Because my sense is as I mentioned before that in over the span of my life one of the great advantages of a parliamentary system is that when a government especially one that doesn't have a strong majority becomes continually scandal-ridden that the The The precedent is for parliament to dissolve and for an election to take place now I know we just had an election that was completely unnecessary But we have a situation in Canada where the liberals have moved radically to the left They've supplanted the NDP who are supporting them constantly in what is essentially a coalition government and we have the horrible fascistic Of the Canadian government radically subsidizing the legacy media in Canada in general and the cbc and specifically to the tune of 1.2 billion dollars a year to produce no audience and a set of facts that are entirely convenient to the Trudeau government and so We have this perfect storm, especially if you add to that the fact that Trudeau has essentially Gutted parliament for two years partly partly as a consequence in principle of the covid scandal But they just announced this week or last week that Virtual parliament is going to continue for another year which year this is just Every month every week. There's something else the Trudeau government does that I find so Preposterous and unbelievable that it makes me think that there's something wrong with the way that i'm looking at the news What the hell's going on with the virtual parliament, what is this? Well, i'll take the virtual parliament first, but I am going to circle back To another thing that you all several things you've already mentioned I thought for what it's worth And insofar as I can think I thought that even when the pandemic was fresh And we didn't have a clear understanding of its true risks or its true range Or whether the vaccines or or or other Emoluments were going to be available. I thought that even then When at least the grocery store clerks were still on the job and at that time by the way So were the much praised truckers. Mr Trudeau himself came out to say we must thank them for bringing our food and our medicines In the beginning of this pandemic. I thought even then That the idea that the people who had been elected To the highest office that this federal business this country can offer the house of commons in a time of emergency That's when they do meet And even if there was some element of risk involved That's when they do meet now that was at the beginning Now you drop down two years And the vacillating regime of covid it went up and went down. They changed this they changed that wear a mask Don't wear a mask. These are good. These are good. Take one vaccine take two vaccines Take two more booster shots stay six feet apart. Don't take it after two whole years When they finally concede that their own mismanagement Can't continue forever The idea that as he closes down parliament on june the 22nd of 2022 In not coalition in collusion with mr. Singh he announces in advance That this already gutted eviscerated disemboweled parliament of the last two years is now going to have another full year with people Sitting in their their washrooms in some cases going on zoom. There's a side point to this and it's important to make it Just because you have the mps Talking to each other by some teleconference That's not parliament The reason that parliament stands and the reasons that parliament always were they are places of assembly The newfoundland house, for example, actually wears the etymological force. It is the house of assembly And why do you talk of assembly? canada Is vast its geography is almost its defeat And therefore because of its vastness the various regions personalities and cultures of those regions are vastly Dissonant different to use a truco term diverse It's important for mps from all over the country to be in one place For a continuous time to have interaction response and mutual communication even if it's argument They have to learn from each other the whole of the country You don't do that with a zoom on your bookcase Well, one of the things i've been thinking about on the putin front is that one of the consequences of of the covid lockdowns is that Is that world leaders haven't had a chance to meet face to face? And now we've substituted zoom for that and zoom is a narrow channel now i've been in washington too and increasingly the congressmen in washington don't move to washington and 40 percent of them sleep in their Offices, they don't have apartment buildings and so they haven't built the social communities in washington that would enable the democrats to talk to one another Or the democrats to talk to the republicans across the aisle in the social interactions that you have if you generate a shared community And so this rush to substitute Narrow channels of electronic communication merely out of convenience. We have absolutely no idea whatsoever That what that will do to the parliament and it could easily destroy it Well, I'll tell you what? It it already does it to parliament zoom parliament is a ghost It is the ghost of a dead parliament the notion of again the the 300 plus Mps being forced by the nature of the country to be in ottawa to be in one huge building To share the same chamber to meet each other informally That's how they inform themselves of the range and nature of the country number two as you just point out The idea once you get there you you get this interaction The the fraud politics of the united states are partially because these people don't simply meet It's very easy to form enemies on twitter and facebook and via zoom But if you sit down and have a meal even with a person who wildly disagrees with you And you have to exchange the normal human courtesies You suddenly modify This visceral response that you throw out so rudely on on this ghost network of twitter and facebook And what you what you seem to see on the electronic communication front is that Differences get highlighted and similarities vanish and it is definitely the case that if you sit down with someone for a meal Or if your kids are on the same baseball team that you find out that you're really about 90 percent the same And 10 different and when the channels of communication are narrowed that inverts and flips and and then We also could add to that rex the fact that while parliament's a check on executive power And we could use some checks on trudeau's power, but when you and I were much younger And maybe only about 20 years ago The press was also an independent check and now the press is in the pockets of the government and I called that Fascist earlier and I I meant that what we're seeing worldwide is a fascist enterprise weirdly enough on the left side Um that involves a collusion between media technology and government and fascism the root of the word fascism means to bind together Together and the central right exactly the central element of a fascist state is collusion of the Of the elites let's say and the eradication of any checks and balances and that's sort of that's reminiscent to me of The desirability of that is reminiscent to me of trudeau's express admiration for the chinese communist party and its efficiency in moving forward Let's say on the environmental front something that he's expressed uh Explicit admiration for and so and I would also say that's hurting canada's International reputation in ways that canadians just don't seem to realize Including among moderate liberal types Well, let's go first with the with the media and the fact that the media the main media in this country legacy columbine you will Have accepted the devil's handshake It simply cannot be otherwise said that the press the media The instruments of inquiry skepticism and test Can be directly subsidized By the one major institution the whole government Which in many ways they are charged by their very nature To investigate to be skeptical about to inquire to collide with to contest And the idea that in this soft environment you accept huge sums of money And by the way the traffic between the news media and the political media how many journalists ends up as aides to the ministers Well, Mr. Truro's chief aide ben chin began on the toronto media station The the the cross currents between journalism and politics. That's one thing now, by the way in addition to the money That's a that's a really big thing and it should be a shock to any journalist Here's another thing that gives you an even deeper and I think in certain ways A more worrisome collusion and that is that the mindset of the majority and i'm not one of these Conspiracy people about the press but I know it enough from 25 or 26 years in it That the mindset the mentality The the tendency the the major media offices of Parliamentary and are already in tune with the agenda of the government They are constantly either indirectly subtly or not. So subtly actually supporting the government and Making themselves the opposition to the opposition It is really quite remarkable with rcmp scandals with emergency act with truckers with inflation with oil That pier polyvair who is still an outsider looking in Gets a lot of hits. He's going to tear apart Whereas this good giant media it's because they share the agenda they share the social identities business They certainly share the diversity thing The obsession with racialist politics and of course the the absorption entirely On the idea of sexual identity and pro- in other words all of the social justice issues The press and the parliament are in the same place So yeah being paid for his fascism and and finally that truda with the china thing. That's very good when he was not yet leader And when he felt he could relax so easily And talk about these things That's what we call the kinsey gaff. You say the thing you really mean and in his case, you know If we were china I could turn the environment around on the dime that the real thing there is not so much the dictatorship of china It shows that he has a fondness for the ability to merely operate by fiat And if you study the last five and six years and in particular the period from covet on Covid was a continuous fiat That completely gutted the civil rights the charter of rights He has people fired he has people and then when the convoy comes he calls them racist homophobes misogynist A fringe minority that should not note this word that should not be tolerated His empathy for china basically Constitutes one element of the personality. He does not does not like opposition He guts parliament to make sure that there isn't any and he makes a deal He makes a deal with his co-signer. Mr. Singh So that there will never be a confidence motion. And if he wants to have parliament zoom for another year Mr. Singh is there with the ready salute and the genuflection to give it to him now, well the the the this this certainty of Compulsion, let's say that drives trudeau forward seems to be rooted in his false moral sense that because he's concerned like the other members of the davos world economic forum, etc With the long-term health of the planet whatever that means that nothing That gets in his way could possibly be regarded as ethical or moral and so and the press who's now more than ever made up of political Nobelists utopian wannabes do everything they possibly can to collude and to move that agenda forward and then we could add to that rex I went through this new bill c11 because i'm one of the people Whom whom it will hypothetically affect although I have a number of maneuvers up my sleeve so to speak to bypass that entirely and I know canadians don't understand this but let's say that the new media Which is the internet itself? was capable of producing some of the opposition to the globalists and trudeau that the legacy media have Abandoned and i'm thinking of people like say, uh, russell brand who's on the left and not to mention You know any of the conservative commentators in the united states? but um Now what the now what the canadian what the what the bill c11 has done? Is basically and this is unbelievable. I can't believe I read it correctly. It basically defined all internet content of any sort as Subject to the same crtc canadian radio and television Uh core. What is it corporation? I don't remember the last word that doesn't really matter. No, it doesn't matter They've defined them as broadcasters that are equivalent. Let's say to cbc or ctv Now the reason that those broadcasters are different was because the government had to parse up the airwaves because the airwaves were actually a scarce resource Now and the internet is not a scarce resource and now as far as I can tell reading the reading bill c11 which is an unbelievably vague document if a internet Service provider a private one so a small business person like me. Let's say Doesn't broadcast in french and english and in indigenous languages and to any diverse range of people with disabilities And highlight canadian content then the government can do what it needs to do to Deprioritize their distribution and they'll do that by putting pressure on the uh search engine providers like youtube and google or Just stopping them all together and I read this bill and All of it again rex too. The bill is couched in all this diversity inclusivity and equity terminology Which it's the same solution to every problem, right? And so not only do we have this massive press collusion with the government that's absolutely unconscionable in a western democracy and and but we also have now the government clamping down More viciously than in any other developed country on the freedom for canadians to get access to All of the all of the information on the internet not just that produced by canadians I'm inclined to believe that this idea That these ah intellectuals It's mainly a shallow cabinet. I don't care how condescending that sounds but it mainly is That they somehow or other Have been given vatican-like infallibility To judge what is correct and is not correct To make decisions that will hold back by the way the whole idea of disinformation and misinformation coming out of the mouths of this government I mean They are the greatest purveyor of confusion and evasion and the idea that they then Are going to be the kind of grandmas or mrs Grundy as it used to be called in the 19th century and protect the tender sensibilities of minds that are better than their own Yeah, i'm tired of people and i'm sure you are too because it's getting so cliched to bringing up george orwell But because he put the stamp on it and gave the template The idea that a central authority Runs thought and speech and makes judgments on what is and what's not and under the banner of diversity inclusion and equity Which is really a hidden a hidden ideology pumped up by vast self-righteousness and granting pseudo infallibility to those who are sensitive We know this is not the case. Mr. Trudeau got rid of his only aboriginal female minister There's equity there's diversity They confuse this is a big point, too They confuse either at davos which you referenced or any other high meeting with saying that you are virtuous Is the same thing as being it And there's a hidden not a hidden there's a blatant arrogance attached to any government that thinks that in the modern communication system that it should have any business outside of The exact things that are defined by law as incitement and real rabid hate They will call hate something. They simply don't like it's not an easy It's not an easy emotion to define c11 as michael geist and I know you follow him Michael geist is the professor of communication who most And most articulately and most deeply is warning over and over to give this bunch That can't issue a passport That have a pay system for their own civil servants that's three or four years Misfunctioning that can't let passengers walk out of pierson airport within less than 24 hours should suddenly have the government of the thoughts and reactions And speeches and positions and films and talks like this like yours It's absurd But it's more than that This is truly frightening You mean What is this gulping for more power than you need? Well, it's the imposition of an ideology and go back to your china point. Here's the reason that he may really admire china Because china it happens to be communism in that case China is fired only as was russia By an ideology by a set of narrow ideas from which no deviation No criticism under penalty of exile or death is allowed not as hard over here But die is an ideology and ideology makes those claims and fills those who hold it with a completely a completely unacceptable level of moral Certitude not certainty milsie 11 is a disaster and one more quick point It is shameful It is shameful to the essence that the main main canadian press Are not as one voice And a one intense voice saying we're not having this We are simply not having this you are not going to rule on what is information and not information You are not going to rule on the presence of citizens on the new channels of communication And seeing you've already fouled the official or legacy means to some serious degree We're certainly not going to allow you to put a pillow over the mouth of the only possible new exchanges that we have It's a terrible idea An idea apart from arrogance righteousness and the belief in his own infallibility I can't see why but mario Why aren't the mps even in his own party? saying justin You're dreaming you're out of touch. We don't want to go there. We're not following you on this Where's the courage any of these caucuses? They hand wave about diversity inclusivity equity the environment and then in bill c11 They add the protection of the canadian culture to that and which sounds like something taken out of like 1979 or 1980 it's such an outdated idea and one of the other terror terrifying things about bill c11 is that We won't in canada if this is actually enforced With the collusion, let's say of google and youtube and so forth and the forced collusion in some sense because those companies are not going to break the law Canadians won't even know what information is being hidden from them because the laws will take the form of invisible algorithms that merely Deprioritize at the listing of content that doesn't meet the impossible criteria that have been laid down and bill c11 is basically written in a way That allows the government to interfere with the promulgation of any information that they deem Unacceptable for any reason because there are so many restrictions on what you're allowed to do now that there's no possible way that that any Any member of the alternative media can meet the criteria It's just not possible and it won't just be youtube broadcasters and podcasters It's going to be people who provide all sorts of services online because the bill is written in such a vast manner that The provision of any services on the internet and we're talking about the internet here, right? Which is something people really depend on that that'll all fall under the invisible auspices of a tiny coterie of Ideologically addled bureaucrats and algorithms. There are so many points to make in this As long as this is 2022, I haven't got the year exactly right but 1637 1640 or somewhere near that It was when milton wrote ariel pagidica, which is when parliament of great bit was deciding then that you know scurrilous pamphlets Usually of a religious orientation Of a religious orientation Uh had to be had to be prohibited had to be censored and of all the great speeches about free expression uh the value of books The value of publication of all the defenses of real free speech and real free thought The ariel pagidica is classic And as milton says, you know, whoever knew truth to be defeated in an open contest now, that's 1637 This is 2022 And how it can come to pass That a government with a military power With the ability to imprison we were making fun of or scared by the big tech companies Google slanting his search machine twitter deciding who should be banned and who should not be banned Who should be suspended and who should not be suspended we didn't like it when the private enterprise operators Did they make deals with china? How does google and facebook and and twitter work in those and we said my lord a couple of guys from you know From the tech valley ruling which thoughts can get on platforms and which cannot we thought that was pretty well, I still is pretty bad But now you have as michael geist said this is an alarming thing because geist Is a very calm individual. He's a solid intellectual and on this subject in particular. He knows what he's saying We have the only legislation In this in this arena That parallels get ready for it north korea You pile all this on and by the way, there's another reason why that's a new first for canada Yeah, but let's tie this together Why do you think he thought it was very useful to have a zoom parliament for another year? Because the gathering together of all the people who might wake up to this And who might because of personal interaction across the lines might see that this is not a step too far This is a gigantic leap between mountain peaks too far No, he wants the parliament closed down or as I said emasculated So that he could bring in in his life. This is his last term i'll make that a declarative statement Whatever big moves he wishes to make But again in this particular case We've had it as I said we go back to furthered milton even you don't let power determine information thought and speech I mean if if donald trump were president and decided to regulate the internet Nine-tenths of the world would fly up Just can go on about how horrific the justice system of the supreme court is while up here He plays a game halfway between animal farm in 1984 Uh, by the way, he's making so as you point out. There are so many scandals That one gulps and swallows the other They he has a scandal management that's better than any other Have a fresh scandal and then we kill the previous one It's hard to follow him. Yeah. Well exactly. Well you you asked a little earlier What scandal we should perhaps focus on most intently and it is very difficult to To do that when they're coming at you at a mile a minute when you have like 15 things that have been done in the last Six months that should have caused the collapse of the government, but I would say the worst thing that trudeau did it's a hybrid between Invoking and then rescinding the emergencies act for no reason whatsoever Then he relied on the information provided to him deceitfully by cbc who retracted it and then worst of all freezing the bank accounts and interfering with the bitcoin exchanges because trudeau established a precedent now that should Terrify canadians of any political engagement whatsoever, which is that if you happen to be peripherally involved with a demonstration No matter how legal the demonstration is at the moment and you donate money that first of all you'll be tracked And that's bad enough like that's terrifying enough, but not only Track but that all your ability to interact with the entire economic system because it's not just freezing your bank accounts, right? It's freezing your mortgage. It's freezing your visa. It's making it impossible for you to withdraw any cash It's putting your family at risk To compare this to what the chinese are doing with the social credit system is no Leap and that's a terrible conspiratorial thing to say but it also reflects a deep underlying reality and i'm telling you I I can't tell you how many people have expressed shock and dismay to me Throughout the united states and through europe about the fact that trudeau well implemented the emergencies act And and and and suspended civil liberties and then froze the bank accounts, especially because Canada has had a great reputation on the financial front for 150 years The integrity of our financial system including our banks has been one thing that canada really got right and now Well, what would you think if you were if you were a foreign investor or or anyone seriously considering doing business with canada? when you know now that if you're a republican Uh and heaven forbid a trump supporter But a republican even that your views are now deemed so extreme that it's neat and just To declare them an emergency and to steal all your money with no trial with no due process of law Completely arbitrarily and behind the scenes No, scotia bank apologized about two weeks ago. I don't know if any of the other big banks did They said they did it under duress well, that's because they're bloody cowards and they're foolish as well because They they've taken a catastrophic hit to their international reputation Well, I'll go i'll just start at the again go back to where you began yourself the imposition of revocation before ratification of the emergency act that had about seven to eight days of life We have not had yet We didn't have it then that's for sure We have not had yet the list of of circumstances That justified that's a really big word justice gave justice to the action That justified the imposition of the equivalent of the war measures act because that's what it was to completely suspend The charter of rights on a philosophic basis alone. He basically nullified The entire civil liberties of the entire population of this entire country Because some trucks were parked on an auto wall street, that's only the first part You mentioned the cbc reports that have been dismissed And that he relied on them. I'm not sure that's entirely the case He may have had some of his own Spin masters passed the stories on to cbc in the first place. I have no idea if that was true or not But we had other instances where you had an arson attempt in in a building in ottawa, which was dramatically enhanced by news coverage And mendicino or whatever his name is use that they're going to burn down buildings And lock the doors so people can't get out. We need an emergency act You had all sorts of fabricated faults or totally misleading assertions during a pseudo crisis And then you had the capstone That these people who drove 2500 miles in february across the northern landscape To protest a given government issue Actually were there and had to be paid attention to because they wanted to overthrow the canadian government That statement is so extreme That is beyond laughable And so when he hauls it back before the senate gets a chance to ratify it The legislation says you must Have an inquiry when you call out the highest the most lethal the thermonuclear Legislation of any government he can't avoid having a committee set up And I think it was last week or 10 days ago that christia freeland Who was the deputy deputy prime minister because jagmeet singh is the official deputy He's finally before a parliamentary committee And when they ask her questions either about the rcmp or about this or about that This corn and righteousness and smugness of response the idea that the The greatest invasion of civil liberties It has been passed by with so mellow a response And that gives you that gives them the appetite then if I can call up the emergency act and call a group of savvy common-sense citizens Fringe minority racist if I can if I can set one part of the community against the other And that division there's where the appetite comes from bill c11 got away with the emergency act Well, obviously I can bring in legislation that is even more toxic. Oh, yes I can interfere with rcmp investigations because it seems when I went to the aga con and violated all the ethics permission The rcmp then said well that might be criminal, but we're not considering criminal charges and Jagmeet singh is at the center of a lot of this and that's the point that eventually we will get to i'm sure but the emergency act is I think Because it's not justified because it was for political convenience Because he extemporized a narrative that these were villains and americans and were being funded by dark right-wing forces from outside the country That's the worst because it confounds so many issues together And it's also a stunning accusation. Yeah, it is levied against 50 percent of the population of our greatest ally to the south People in principle that he has to work with us certainly is going to have to work with when the fall comes And so that's just well, that's just another example of his stunning lack of wisdom uh, and his carelessness with his with his actions so So let's let's talk a little bit about a bit more about the interference with the rcmp I'd like you to make some comments about that if you would Well, that's that again people who know canadian politics. I want to apologize, but I'll simply say I regret Uh that is not so fascinating that the people who listen the range of viewers that you have Uh, it may not be as intimate with it as we would wish or I don't know if I'd wish it on them But nonetheless, well, it's a good example of fascist collusion though. I would say and Well, that's a threat to everyone in the west. Yeah, but it also has a great precedent The biggest scandal in terms of principle In terms of something fundamental something that reaches to the rule of law Came a couple of years back when he had an attorney general. I mentioned her already uh ravel ra The indigenous lady from bc. I'm getting your name fooled up in my head for just a second She took a stand that snc lavalin should not get special provisions and she Was ravel she was the attorney general and yet people from his pmo office himself uh the highest civil service cabinet ministers kept pressing Kept pressing her to change her mind. She warned the prime minister If you are attempting to influence an attorney general Who was a singular position in any cabinet? If you are attempting to this is terrible So for eight or nine months She resisted She said no the rule of law can't be politically interfered with now This was this was a prime minister on his office and aides and ministers attempting to bend The operation of justice in canada eventually Mr. Ravel gets fired or basically leaves herself and another fine female cabinet minister went with her but After a bit of a flutter, even though he denied any influence. He said in the globe mail the story is false It was proven to be true Jump ahead two years And now you find out that after the worst mass casually of that kind In canada the murder of 22 people in novscotia That the prime minister's office and his political aides are pressuring or asking or telling uh the head of the rcmp brenda lucky To get information from the investigators in halifax because they were bringing in gun control legislation next week in other words, they wanted to absorb some of the emotional context and the high sensitivity of a singular tragedy so they could advance a political agenda and didn't mind pushing And she didn't mind agreeing To put pressure on a halifax investigation Now you you hear back that the the That mr. Lev, you know all the relevant cabinet ministers. Oh, no, mr Trudeau had a really fine thing. We put no undue influence Under the rcmp the only one word in that sentence. You have to pay attention to it's undue Right exactly. Yeah And yeah, well rex this is all a pattern as far as i'm concerned And i'm speaking as a clinician here, although I hesitate to do so, but i've been watching trudeau for a long time I found it appalling. I found what he was doing appalling right from the beginning because trudeau was enticed into running for leadership As a consequence of what I would describe as a successful appeal to his overweening narcissism He had none of the education or ability or experience necessary To do something as complex as lead a modern country and it was obvious to all and it should have been obvious to him That the single reason that he was picked by the utterly cynical liberals who chose him was first of all his pleasant personal appearance and perhaps not first and foremost but first and foremost His name trudeau the dynastic name the fact that he already had broad-scale marketing and sales appeal and That was enough for him to justify to himself becoming prime minister and then You know, maybe you don't want to damn someone for that because just because he was pierre trudeau's son doesn't mean he doesn't have ability and so it would be possible that someone like that could Take the humble approach and decide that While better him than some evil conservative, let's say and that he could carefully learn to be competent and to do a good job But instead he leapt into the fray immediately Appointing 50 of his cabinet as women even though they were only 25 of the mps and thereby perhaps fatally impairing the qualifications and competence of the cabinet and then Doubling down on his idiot ideology die Let's say diversity inclusivity and equity plus a bit of environmentalism on the side and a hatred for the energy industry and he's been fiddling that fiddle ever since and this theme of narcissism, which I think is apt permeates everything that he does the admiration for china the Dismissiveness that he manifests when he's ever asked questions the overweening legislation like bill c11 that he passes without a seconds Consideration for the fact that maybe we could use some checks and balances in the governmental system on the off chance We might not be a hundred percent right about all our ideological presuppositions The fact that he basically ignores parliament and now that he's made it virtual and then we could add to that is another one Rex which I think is very interesting the fact that he denied Unvaccinated canadians about six million of them. Yes the the the right to travel Which is a big deal in a country like canada and a big deal in other countries as well but not only did he do that, but then when Every country in the world virtually had released people from the co-vid mandates and relaxed the Impositions they put on the rights. He did not Release canadians from that travel ban until months after there was every bit of evidence that it should have been done And all I can say about that was that that was that was sheer bloody narcissistic malevolence There was zero excuse for that and the mere fact that he didn't rescind that policy months ago That in itself should have been enough for the government to fall and if jagmeet singh had an ounce of spine or sense And he has neither he would not be supporting this government in the manner that he does Especially given the putative NDP What would you say affiliation for the common working man? Which is a complete bloody bunch of rubbish that those days are long gone All the union guys are out of the NDP. We have an elite set of utopians Whose presuppositions make the liberal idiocy look like well look look almost like nothing in contrast and the self Righteousness and moralizing that goes along with that and so rex. Why do you think canadians? Have found themselves in this position and why isn't there more? broad-scale Outrage if not rioting in the streets about what's happening at the federal government level Well, there are two or three things that I could say that are I think fairly relevant in this context The first thing is that when he first came in by the way Whether it's narcissism or not that being as it is a clinical as well as poetic term I don't think there's much doubt of it if you're using it in just a conventional lay language Uh why you would install as the leader of the country? Well, it came also because the liberals had been so ill-advised when they picked up for example, mr. Dianne or The traveling political salesman. Mr. Ignatiev who left incidentally within hours of losing and never even said goodbye sometimes the appetite for novelty triumphs over any prudence or consideration of forethought But having seen them for the first term and having seen the glorious appetite for display And for the the gesture Whether it's you know doing some yoga stand on a bench or making sure that you show up In in the right mood at a certain event or attending the pride parade There is there's no single symbolic gestural action That he ever avoided and he signaled he signaled Time and it is a it is in the early days, especially It was a government of signals That he was also a semi-celebrity vogue magazine did a thing on him and the canadian press had a wonderful way I never understood how supine they could be so quickly They talked about when we were having some dissatisfactions with the u.s That he was on a charm offensive And that a charm offensive would disarm either mr. Trump or whomever it was that he was the now you asked a deeper question In the early days. Yes You could put it up. Why are canadians? Not more resistant. Well, like two or three reasons are quite solid Especially as these things have accelerated and intensified meaning the invasions Of government into areas where it should not belong There was this two years Of the regime that more than any other provincial and federal governments imposed You had economy the economy knocked it to bits We do not have an inventory of the tens of thousands perhaps hundreds of thousands Of independent and small businesses that gasp for air That waited for the next in-breath Merely to see if they could make another day in the last two years You had relatives unable to see their elder parents or or or elder relatives, you know, you had socioeconomic Psychological and medical obsessions and anxieties That went from the from the primary from the intimate exchange of mother father daughter son to the broad scale And during that particular period, I think everyone was some somewhat off balance. And once again the news media were not doing your job They were all online We always must close everything down and you could have an announcement in the beginning of the pandemic As i've already referenced that masks are bad Actually that came from tam and two months later that you must wear them And no one in the media wanted to collide those two contradictions and say well Are you really as expert as you say that's the first reason covid Took away a lot of the energies that might have been invested in the public sphere And paying attention to politics because so many other strains that are much more intimate and close were at play secondly And I think this is really really telling that in the in the present five and six months when this thing really has Come to new levels Whatever was the deal? That the ndp which traditionally is really the oppositional not the conservatives The ndp are the ones that really put the bite On the liberals remember the war measures act was the forerunner of the emergency act What was the name of the man who even in a genuine crisis? You could make a case that the apprehended insurrection of the war measures act could be just I said make a case And it was popular especially In english canada in that time Who stood up against it who took the flak who took the bad public relations? It was tommy douglas The leader of the new democratic party saying it went too far Mr. Trudeau the elder should not have that power In a new world where you didn't have a genuine crisis and when they were warped when the emergency act was invoked in my judgment for spite and partisan reasons Jagmeet Singh had already guaranteed Justin Trudeau would have no parliamentary interference I don't know what's the deal they talk about dental plans and a few things the ndp won't but I don't know the internalities What was the discussion? What went on between mr Trudeau and mr Singh that he would oblige them meaning sing for the next three years and preserve them from criticism This is the telling moment. Well it's quite stunning Isn't it that the ndp can enter into a pact with the devil? Let's say And none of us even know why it's like what's in it for you jagmeet. Oh nothing. Well Well, nothing doesn't seem like a very good bargain. So what the hell's going on behind the scenes? Where are the this is a really good question The ndp does have some fairly vigorous uh, and and occasionally aggressive MPs they certainly can take on the tories when they want and they're by the way, they love taking on the tories That's a big caucus more ill relatively speaking Where are the indica's the ndp does have that that moral kind of aura? And people who join the ndp like to believe at least that there is a morality driving Then that is of a different scale or of a purer value than the other parties. Why are they letting mr sing? So desecrate the central image of the entire why aren't some of the mps In the party talking about and I also ask When it comes to the rcmp thing or the emergency act Why aren't liberals? liberal mps even some ministers Wilson raevo did it. Why is it that we're not hearing? From individual mp. They've been elected by a constituency. They do have autonomy if they want to use it They said talk about caucus discipline. There's only discipline in the caucus if you accept it And if you think the prime minister or a cabinet minister has stepped over the line or the leader of your party is Traducing the reputation of your party Then an mp in the ndp or an mps in the liberal caucus will say hey Mr. Trudeau was going too far with the information legislation He went far too far with the emergency act and his attempt to put the vision Especially against the working class of canadians during the trucker protest That was both unseemly We don't have opposition from the media in the main And obviously with mr sing guaranteeing mr. Trudeau. That's how mr Trudeau could cancel parliament for next year. This is the central dynamic of our entire of the entire Political moment of our time and I have not seen one Major interview from one major one major interview from one major presence on the canadian media scene Sit jagmeet singh down 30 minutes And let's have the story you have not seen it. Yeah. Well, that's unbelievable And well, maybe it's partly the fragmentation of parliament and so all the mps feel isolated and then I know From talking to conservative mps who didn't exactly distinguish themselves in terms of their courage over the last four years either that As individuals, they're all terrified of being isolated and mobbed And the fact that parliament is fragmented and that the media and the new media for that matter is more than capable and willing to mob We could use the former attorney general as case in point Yep means that people on the on the mp side the backbenchers are cowed in a way that I think is unparalleled so Let's turn rex because it's very difficult to cover all the scandals and we haven't even touched on another one. That's major beyond belief, which is that Trudeau has run up more debt in his short time in office than every single prime minister in canada managed in total Since the founding of the state and the consequence of that has been an incredible inflation asset inflation, especially in the housing market and an unparalleled level of Inflation and you can add to that the consequences of his idiot energy policies which have emboldened putin And which have also produced an unparalleled increase in energy prices across canada and so We were also and then that's not enough. That's not enough No, so in the past year I have tried to buy for what it's worth a new car A couple of small boats, uh, just fun boats and I know that's a luxury item, but that's not the point um a snowmobile I tried to make a vinyl record and i've tried to get penguin random house to put out a double edition of my book Penguin couldn't do it because there's a cardboard and paper shortage um the vinyl Uh record industry has an eight to twelve month delay. You can't get a snowmobile You can't get a small boat and no one can buy a car And the reason for that is the supply chains are so disrupted that we that it's cataclysmic One in five container ships are trapped in ports at the moment because the ports can't keep up with the demand We have no idea how badly fragmented the supply chains are and that's going to produce a catastrophic, uh outcome Especially come fall because we're going to have a very difficult time moving enough food around the world to say nothing of enough goods And so we have a massive debt. We have an inflation that's starting to get out of control Yeah, we have a housing bubble. That's no joke and we have And we have supply chain disruptions The magnitude of which have never been seen before at least not in the last 30 years and that pose a threat to the integrity Of the entire world economic system. Yeah, and so that's also seems to be a bit of a problem that trudeau has had a major hand in Producing and that's that's and that's that's along with his stated Disinterest in financial matters because he said that explicitly has no real interest in economic matters You'd never guess that in 2015. He said and I can almost quote I'm looking you straight in the eye now and i'm i'm speaking to you honestly as I always do This is what he was going to have 10 billion dollar deficits per year that by 2019 We will return to a balance by by 2019 now again pre-covid We can understand spending of a considerable magnitude beyond any promise During the regime of covid but the the the extent to which this government Wildly and we never did seek because again he was operating from the cottage He was walking down the steps of the rito hall cottage rather than going to parliament All alone and a little coffee Of media people under a canvas tent And he was throwing out billions this way and billions that way if you do not think that the billions upon billions upon billions that were Blushed out without scrutiny The auditor general did not have adequate means to survey them and he said that and he asked for other people We're going to have our harvest of scandals in years to come, but that's not the main point At the point that you're making That the spending levels of debt and deficit were well over a trillion dollars And the banks of bank of canada has already jacked up the interest rate twice. I talked to a financial man just yesterday It's going to be worse and worse and worse. We have had a holiday from economic reason During this period and he has overspent steven harper was correct The spending during covid may have been necessary, but this was overkill I would say overkill with magnitude and it was not governed. They're even now trying to get back serb payments from one million canadians When the interest rates rise and people who have houses and mortgages start to learn what it is like to be in previously normal times Inflation hits at the worst possible moment Two full years of economic devastation because of covid because of the regime They closed down things that didn't have to be closed. They kill businesses We're going to see tremendous devastation across and then the the the jihad Against alberta oil That is the most that is criminally stupid We are depriving not only alberta, but the canadian treasure During the now the return prices of natural oil and gas highest almost ever And we have made them. Sorry. Mr. Trudeau. Mr. Singh Elizabeth may and and the caval of professional environmentalists Have made poor alberta and saskatchewan's oil and gas industry a demonic presence So How do you reach the level of Political insanity that you kill a primary resource of your own country You just you estranged and anger Justifiably angry they are justifiably angry a whole province or or two And at the same time when mr. Putin who scorns the green philosophy and then that one He's actually right uses the the degenia flexion to greenism of europe and canada To amass the power to use his gas His oil as a leverage to control germany and to influence the operations of europe. He couldn't be in ukraine today If the green fantasy Right and now to threaten the uk with nuclear destruction that was and then let's also point out shall we that one of the consequences of the sanctions so So heroically placed on Putin by the idiot west is that the ruble is at its highest level ever And because oil prices have shot through the roof russia's actually arguably in some ways in better economic shape after the sanctions than they were Before yeah, so that's just bloody brilliant as well and this issue about Uh what's happened on the russian front is anybody with any sense looking at this up to say 10 years ago knew perfectly well that By dampening down oil and gas exploration in in north america and in europe that we were playing into the hands of the worst Impulses of the russians if you had to have your head buried in the sand or somewhere else to not notice that Absolutely explicitly and to hand wave about idiot environmentalism while at the same time producing this potentially fatal dependence on russian largesse and and goodwill is is an abdication of political Responsibility that you'd have to look Uh at history a long time to find an example that would supersede. I wish and I wish with utter futility That again the guardians of our public discourse Uh the official and powerful press Would would now forsake Their deep and intimate marriage with the green movement that they've had for 20 25 years If you watch tv o ontario you've seen an inconvenient truth Which was al gore's flush on the topic about a hundred times cbc is officially if it hasn't said so out loud Is officially a green peace activist network I would like to see now then say okay this embrace Of this virtue signaling hollow ideology Has empowered the most dangerous dictator on the earth the one with nuclear weapons It has impoverished part of the reason for the inflation in our food at the present moment is because of the energy crisis brought on by the by the fatuous pursuit of energy sources that can't work don't work aren't yet developed and don't have the structure or infrastructure even if they were If you want to hear the rest of my conversation with Rex murphy, please go to dailywiredplus.com and become a member today
