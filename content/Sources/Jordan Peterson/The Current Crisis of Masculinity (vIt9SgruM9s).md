 So Jordan, obviously this new series dragons monsters men the first one that we're doing together This series is focused in on how men can be men Why do you think there is such a crisis of masculinity in the first place? And why are there so many people out there who are angry at you for even talking to men? Well, I think it's I think you could think about it as a consequence in some sense of the lack of a concept of original sin oddly enough Mean people bear an existential burden, you know, it's an intrinsic part of life to I suppose to feel guilty in relationship to nature and To feel guilty in relationship to culture No, it's difficult for us to live in harmony with the natural world and for the natural world to live in harmony with us by the way and none of us are all we could be on the social front and One of the consequences and so we have that sense intrinsically, you know that there's a lack in us that needs to be redressed and unfortunately that can be Weaponized and has been and what I see happening to young men in particular boys as well not just young men and maybe even No, maybe starting at the age of toddlers is that we have this sense in the world that Human beings live in antagonism to nature and that we're actually a malevolent force and That our social structures which are clearly capable of the commission of atrocity are fundamentally oppressive patriarchal in their nature and so then if you're a male in a society with that ethos you're the motive force that drives you into the world to live is associated with rapaciousness and Despoil ation on the natural front and then oppression and atrocity on the social front It's like well, then if you're the least bit conscientious because this sort of Accusation hurts conscientious young men the most then the best you can do is Well, let's say castrate yourself. How would that be and that would be real comical Except that it's also happening So I guess that's why that's why I think there's a crisis and There's something serious at the root of it right because we do have to take the fact of our The potential damage we can do to the natural world and the social world we have to take that seriously, but the the proper consequence of taking that seriously is not to Commit harry-cury, let's say in a fit of moral Anxiety and take yourself completely out of the game, but that's the insistence now And it's really and I see that psychoanalytically you know I see that as a manifestation at a symbolic level of something like Well symbolically that's associated with the devouring mother right it's it's an overweening and destructive False compassion that has this devouring quality and that's the reason why I think that's the reason why I think that's the reason quality and Yeah, and that's basically where we're at so so No, it's one of the things that's striking about the sort of hatred that you've gotten from so many is that you've literally been asked Why you're even bothering to speak to men I mean there is this crisis masculinity right there is this idea that? Every form of masculine masculinity is toxic and you've spent your life trying to talk to men and say no no you can channel That masculinity in not only a good way But a necessary and productive and and useful way and people got an angry at you for this where do you think that's coming from? Why that's obviously a good thing that you're doing why are so many people upset with you for well? The thing is I never really set out to talk to men Specifically I but I did set out at least in part to make a case for the utility of both the feminine and the masculine Spirit and it turned out that making the case for the masculine spirit was something that was more demanded by the culture Let's say the anger that's a complicated issue We touched on some of it in relationship to the despoiling of nature and the idea of the oppressive and atrocity Atrocity committing patriarchy, but then there's another issue too, which I think is germane Because of family fragmentation There's a very large number of women Who have just like there's a very large number of men who have never had a real word of encouragement in their whole life It's a really sad thing to see it's a really really sad thing to see to see that deeply and to have seen that reflected In so many thousands of people, but there are many women who've never had a positive relationship with anyone male in their life And so one of the consequences of that we know for example that younger women are more likely to be Attracted to men who show dark triad traits narcissistic Machiavellian and psychopathic and people who have those traits are characterized by the mimicry of competence and so what women want in men more than anything else is competent generosity and the Data on that are very clear, but you can mimic that if you're narcissistic And if you're a young woman you what woman you can be deluded by that It's partly because it points to the problem of dissociating Competent confidence From the expression of power per se so we could call power I'll define that as the willingness and ability to use compulsion to attain your aims now if you are someone who Has a proclivity to manifest power then that looks like the manifestation of both ambition and will and If you haven't had a positive relationship with anyone masculine in your life And maybe with not even with your own internal masculinity say you can't discriminate between power and Competent the ambition that serves competence and so because that's terrifying because the power if you have Nate had only negative relationships with men They're their capability to use power becomes such a threat That it has to be opposed at all costs even if it manifests itself within the say within the developmental pathway of your own son and So so some of that's familial breakdown, and then you have a multi-generational pattern of that that makes it even worse And so that's that's definitely part of it. You know there's an ideological drum. That's being beaten constantly both on the Sociological constructivist front right that's the oppressive patriarch and then on the environmental front and then you add to that the fact that Well on the left this especially the radical types their whole damn doctrine It's the most pathological doctrine you could invent if you set out to invent a pathological doctrine And I mean that I'm not making a joke. I really mean that in the deepest possible sense the notion that The fundamental human motivation is the willingness and ability to use compulsion power power It's all about power and every time I hear that now from someone. I think that is not a sociological observation That is a confession on your part and so and it's also just complete bloody nonsense mean You all you all know this You have friends because they're compelled to be your friends Like that's definitely not how you have friends you might have Bully henchmen that way, but you don't have friends Power is an extraordinarily unstable basis to establish a marriage on plus It just doesn't work because it turns out that women who are so annoying are very difficult to oppress You know so you can try but yeah, it's not that easy And I don't think that we've been all that historically successful in doing so But it's also a it's also a preposterous proposition because because The expression of power with an intimate relationship does not produce intimacy or a relationship the best it can produce produces like a combination of tyranny and slavery and that does not characterize the institution of marriage per se so there is this insistence among them Among the radicals that power is the fundamental Motivation and that's and then you think too Okay, you're only motivated by power that means that we can only get along if our interests align because if you're motivated by power and I'm motivated by power and our interests don't align and There's nothing else but power Then the only option I have is to turn you into an enemy and try to destroy you because we can't engage in dialogue That's dialogue goes and the reason we can't engage in dialogue is because there's no logos. There's just power So there's no such this is why it's good thing for conservatives to understand you have to understand that the debate about free speech on campus In the deepest sense is not a debate about who should be allowed to speak freely That's nothing. That's that's a trivial debate. You can even understand it in some sense if I don't agree with you Maybe I don't want you to talk but the debate is about something much deeper Which is whether or not the idea of free speech itself is just a mask developed essentially by Europeans to justify the oppressive Patriarchy in the most devious possible way and the answer the radicals have to that question is yes That's exactly what it is. And so there's there's no free speech whatsoever That's an illusion that's promulgated by people are only trying to justify their claim to power That's what the bloody argument is about and so and I just think all of that's I it's wrong in every way It's wrong theologically. It's wrong psychologically. It's wrong scientifically even chimpanzees who have a patriarchal social structure their social structures if they are based on the on power on compulsion They're unstable and the alpha chimps who use power are very likely to meet an extraordinarily brutal and Premature end so Franz de Waal the Dutch primatologist has detailed out this wonderfully He's shown that even among our closest biological relatives It's the ability to make peace and to engage in reciprocal interactions that constitutes the basis for a stable polity even among chimps and it's obviously the case that that's The proper basis for social relations, especially among free people and I've been trying to puzzle out Especially my lecture to a recently what the antithesis to Power is to the will to power Let's say in terms of arbitrary compulsion and it's something like the spirit of free and voluntary play And that's a wonderful thing to know. It's so optimistic. We guys were talking about optimism earlier You know if you're so imagine this is that if you structure your relations optimally and I mean optimally with yourself with your Intimate partner with your family with your community the highest level of attainment of that structuring is The manifestation of the spirit of voluntary play and that's so lovely because there's nothing better than playing Fundamentally and you know human beings and other mammals as well also have a biological circuit that mediates play that was discovered by a man Yaak, Panksepp, and he showed that Play is unbelievably important to the development of children For a variety of complicated reasons partly because they're practicing to be competent adults But also that it can be suppressed by almost any other emotion or motivation So your kids can't really play if they're hungry or tired or wet or or upset The same would apply within your relationship if there's stresses and tensions the play disappears But if you optimize the relationship and the circumstance then the spirit of play can manifest itself And I would also say that's also the fundamental purpose of fathers in some sense is to imagine that paradise That's a walled garden. That's what paradise means so it's walls Structure and then the garden inside is nature and a nature that's tended that the masculine role in In child rearing is something like the erection of the walls So that play can manifest itself within the walls, and that's a real good combination of security because that's what the walls are for But then The kind of freedom that allows for untrammeled development to occur in the most positive possible sense, and so I would say that those of us who are standing against the Radicals who insist that the only human motivation is power Can oppose that in part by putting forward the observation that the proper antithesis to that is the spirit of voluntary play That's what I hope we're going to do with the daily wire You
