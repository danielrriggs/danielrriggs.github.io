 Kids are being led to believe and parents are being led to believe that you can step in with these very powerful medications, these hormones, and you can deny biology, and you can pause biology. You can create a persona of the opposite sex without paying a huge price. That is the lie that's being told, that you're not going to pay a price for this. Oh yeah, there might be a few side effects. No, no, no, no. I mean like a whole missing forearm, for example, and a penis that doesn't work, and sterility, and lowered voice, decreased bone density, and the increased probability of the development of cancer, and no evidence whatsoever that there's any mental health benefit, and all the trauma that you put your family through, and all the regret that's going to emerge later in life when you find out that you're sterile, no ability to breastfeed, and complete loss of erotic sensation in the nipples, and etc, etc. You mean those risks?
