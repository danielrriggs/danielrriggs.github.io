 The timing is suspect. Why would you drop off those laptops a week before your father announces his run for president? To call it careless is to barely scrape the surface. Especially when you know perfectly well what's on those laptops. Not only this treasure trove of homemade pornography, which is like a highly questionable enterprise in and of itself, you have to wonder exactly what motivates someone to continually film himself engaging in sexual activity with all the various hookers that he was consorting with and strippers and so forth. There's a vindictive carelessness about it that's also market. Because it's not one laptop, it's three. And three is a lot. There's this immense amount of detail about all of these business enterprises that have been accumulating for decades. Is he that addled that he didn't even notice that this was foolish? Or is there desire to be caught? Because that's certainly a possibility. Or is there revenge against his whole family, including his father? I mean, I don't know how to make heads or tails of this because it's so utterly preposterous.
