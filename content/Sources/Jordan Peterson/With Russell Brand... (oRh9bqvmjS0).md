 Here I am, Russell Brand, with Dr Professor Doctor, Dr Professor Jordan Peterson. You've got to join us and watch and listen to Under the Skin. What did we talk about? Oh God, we talked about everything under the sun. Yeah, yeah, you're an exhausting interviewer in the best possible way. We really, really enjoyed it. I think it was a good, open conversation. I think we went through a lot of topics, such as we talked about the controversies that you've been involved with, even some of my controversies. If you enjoy it, that would... We talked about inequality. We talked about inequality. We talked about politics. Power. Temperament. Who determines what words mean, where power lies. I mean, it's a pretty good conversation. We both have got vague headaches. Yes, yes. We both feel a bit sort of exhausted. This would probably be the bit where we would say something stupid. So please listen to Under the Skin and, well, do what you like with your life, really. But there's one thing you could do. You could do that within the scope of your freedoms. Right, right. Thank you, thank you. Thank you very much. Yeah, Under the Skin. Thank you.
