 Hi, this is the second of a 12-part series of short videos based on my new book Beyond order 12 more rules for life each video features one of the rules as well as a paragraph From the chapter based on that rule Rule two is imagine who you could be and then aim single-mindedly at that This paragraph is taken from a chapter subsection entitled who are you and who could you be? An unforgettable story captures the essence of humanity and distills Communicates and clarifies it bringing what we are and what we should be into focus It speaks to us motivating the attention that inspires imitation We learn to see and act in the manner of the heroes of the stories that captivate us These stories call to capacities that lie deep within our nature, but might still never develop without that call We are dormant adventurers Lovers leaders artists and rebels but need to discover that we are all those things By seeing the reflection of such patterns in dramatic and literary form That is part of being a creature that is part nature and part culture An unforgettable story advances our capacity to understand our behavior beyond habit and expectation toward an imaginative and then verbalized understanding Such a story presents us in the most compelling manner with the ultimate adventure the divine Romance and the eternal battle between good and evil All this helps us clarify our understanding of moral and immoral attitude Personal and social this can be seen everywhere and always Question Who are you or at least who could you be? answer part of the eternal force that constantly confronts the terrible unknown Voluntarily part of the eternal force that transcends naivety and becomes dangerous enough in a controlled manner to understand evil and beard it in its lair and part of the eternal force that faces chaos and turns it into productive order or The takes order that has become too restrictive reduces it to chaos and renders it productive once again and All of this being very difficult to understand consciously but vital to our survival is transmitted in the form of the stories that we cannot help but attend to and It is in this manner that we come to apprehend.
