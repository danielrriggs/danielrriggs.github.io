 Everyone makes mistakes in their lives and I would say probably everybody makes unforgivable mistakes. If we're going to take ourselves apart about that permanently, then we're all ruined. Well, you made the best decision you could with the information that you had at the time. Kind of sounds like a cop-out in a way, but it's actually not a cop-out at all. You make the best decision that you can with the information that you have at the time. And then I would always look at the guys and say, what was their intent behind this decision that they made? Look, why did they do that? You want to learn, but you don't want to dwell. If you dwell on the past, if you dwell on the mistakes you made, like you said, everybody is just doomed.
