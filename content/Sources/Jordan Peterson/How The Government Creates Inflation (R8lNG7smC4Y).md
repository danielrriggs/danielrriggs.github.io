 Inflation is really just another tax because governments create inflation. Inflation is also probably one of the most misunderstood words in the English language and deliberately so. I think governments around the world kind of led the campaign to redefine inflation. So if you go back to the origin of the word and if you have a dictionary, even from the 1980s, a Webster's dictionary, you'll get the real definition of inflation. So inflation is an expansion of the money supply. That's all it is. Deflation is a contraction of the money supply. So if you even think about the word inflate, inflate is to expand like a balloon. If you fill a balloon with air, it expands. So with inflation, what's being expanded is the money supply. Who expands the money supply? Governments.
