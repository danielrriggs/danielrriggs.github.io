 Hello there, mr. Rubin All right, JP January 1 we got anything good for the people Well, I don't know how good it is. I Guess we're gonna find out how good it is I it's not something I'm thrilled about by any stretch of the imagination So you and I have been talking for a couple of weeks now ever since this scandal around Carl Benjamin or Sargon of a Todd broke and We decided well a while back that we were going to well do a variety of things right we were going to Announce our departure from patreon, which is what we're doing in this video I'm going to leave patreon January 15th. I Also am going to leave patreon on January 15th, which by the way, we should just be clear This is not something that we wanted to do. We were both perfectly happy on patreon patreon at least for me It's been the backbone of my show I mean that's it's somewhere between 60 and 70 percent of our funding is through patreon So this is not something we wanted to do I know we're gonna talk about a whole bunch of things in this reporting But that New York Times article that came out the implication was oh, we're doing this for money It's like we're taking a major hit right now and opening ourselves up to all sorts of risks So I'm going ahead and doing that because I believe we can do something better We've got to figure out exactly what that is and that's what we're working on so we can say two things I mean I'd also like to thank the patreon people for what they did in the past because they provided me with a tremendous amount of or the ability the Opportunity to generate a tremendous amount of financial support at a time I really needed it and so I'm not happy in the least with what has happened I have thought about a lot and believe that Given patrons proclivity to censor and the reasons that they're doing it, especially as I've looked more and more deeply into the reasons Particularly with regards to my discovery of the website changed the terms I've become Increasingly convinced that it's unethical to continue my association with the company And I also agree Jack Conti said in that New York Times article trying to justify say Sam Harris's departure and our threatened departure It was motivated Primarily by financial gain and like look I've got nothing against financial gain You know, I've said that from the beginning I and if if things that I'm doing generate an honest amount of money that I can put to Reasonable use then so much the better but This is a major financial blow I'm using the patreon money for a variety of reasons most particularly to support this Educational endeavor that I've talked to people about right our attempt to build an online education system And so like it's a major hit. Yeah, and of course, you know just to be clear It's like when we're doing my show, I mean, I don't have to tell everybody about YouTube demonetization But for example my show a week or two ago with the mom to Edie was demonetized by the algorithm then Demonetized further after manual review by a human so it's patreon It's the it's the supporters the individual people that allow us to go ahead and do more of these Controversial so to speak episodes So yeah Just nothing that we're doing right now is against the people that have supported us or our patrons or anything like that This is no this is about making a stand against this ever moving encroachment on free speech on free expression and the rest of it And it's like this is one that we just feel is the right one To make the move on and the reason that we jointly decided on January 15th Well, there was a couple of reasons. The first was that we thought that we might have something approximating an alternative Potentially available for preliminary launch at that date Although we've decided to delay that because the user interface needs work Because that's the other thing right is that there needs perhaps to be a replacement for patreon if that's a possibility Like it's not obvious to me that corporations can run platforms for untrammeled communication Successfully on the net in today's climate and yeah anything I might design but let's not let's not gloss over that I mean it might be possible that the patreon method is not what's needed exactly for the future of the internet I mean, this is what we're trying to figure out right now, which is why we've got every engineer I mean people from Google and Facebook and Yahoo and everybody reaching out to us because it's like Everyone's trying to solve this problem and it's still I mean one of the things we've been talking about now for the last Well, it's really for the last year Intensely in the last month is What actually is the problem itself because until we really figure out what the problem is? Well, I think I think the problem is How to regulate an incredibly diverse range of opinions if such regulation needs to be Instantiated we could take a limit case for example The desire of companies like Facebook not to have their platforms used for recruitment for Isis It's hard to make a case that that's not a reasonable restriction, right? But then but then the next issue is I Think you could make an exception there because maybe you consider that a wartime exception or something like that But then the fundamental problem to me seems to be and I'll return again to that change the terms website that a whole variety of companies and Organizations spearheaded in not least by the Southern Poverty Law Center that hateful organization Yeah, the worst that has decided that they're going to Compel encourage What If aim perhaps companies that don't band together to regulate what they see as hate speech Yeah, and this is where well This is where the moving line is the key part of this because you can always find the print the most Fringe cases you can always find Isis on one side and you know The most fringe KKK white supremacist group or whatever you want to call it on the other side But let's not forget Southern Poverty Law Center. They've written things about you They've written things about me I on her C. Ali and my June was and Sam Harris and and a living My June sued them to and actually won so there there is a pushback, but this is just another level of the stand It's like they cannot be trusted to be on the boards of any of these Organizations that are deciding what terms of service. Yeah, but they are should have access. It's really who should have access to the internet It's worse than that Dave because when they start to pressure the credit card companies and I would consider this a warning to everyone who's listening It's like okay, let's think this through So the New York Times last week wrote an article about the credit cards Complicity in loaning money to that terrible tiny minority of people who engaged in mass shootings right stating that it was the responsibility of the credit card companies to monitor and Potentially prevent that activity. It's like okay. So so what's this? What's the idea here? The idea is that The companies to whom we have entrusted our Monetary system in large parts that would be the credit card companies now get to review our Spending patterns to determine if what we purchase is in accordance with that with what they regard is morally acceptable Okay, and we think that's a good idea That that's where we're headed and and MasterCard and Visa and PayPal are already starting to block people They brought MasterCard was instrumental in blocking Spencer Robert Spencer, right? It's Robert Spencer not Richard Spencer Yes, it's best-selling author and the guy who runs G had watched MasterCard Required patreon to de-platform him and just to be very clear. They sent out a tweet which everyone can find I'm shocked that they haven't deleted it yet where they said that they and they use this word Which I think is the key to the whole thing. They said that they Unfortunately had to delete his patreon because of MasterCard So what are they actually saying there are is patreon saying? Oh, we didn't want to delete your page But MasterCard forced our hand. I mean that is some deeply scary stuff Yeah well and we have to talk about hate speech because you know, I think the whole concept of look obviously there is People can be very nasty when they communicate But the idea that That there's an identifiable category but and you can put boundaries around it and term it hate speech and then you can produce committees or Deal with people on a one-to-one basis as patreon is doing without any central policy or let's say despite their central policy or that you could turn that into an algorithm that could Validly identify hate speech without producing false positives, right without accusing people who shouldn't be accused of violating all of that's just completely it's just beggars the imagination as far as well of course and you're also just Opening a Pandora's box from hell because just in the last couple days I don't know if you saw this but the women's march in California canceled their rally because they felt that it was too white Yeah Now imagine if they canceled their rally because it was too black or to anything else It's like so does that now count as hate? Are you guys now being racist against white people now? That wouldn't be a problem for these guys one of the things that I can't fathom in some sense is the lack of imagination on the part of the people who are engaging in Censorship of what they regard as hate speech like there's an old military adage Which is that if you invent a weapon it will be used by your enemy within 15 years Okay, so what what makes the people on the on the left because they're the ones who are doing this What as you can clearly see? In the Change the terms website What makes them so sure that exactly the same tactics won't be used against them? At the drop of a hat once once the tactics have been validated and put in place I think it's either it's either just very short-sightedness on their hand or they think that they can actually Stamp out enough hate within that very small window before it would turn on them or they just don't think these things fully through Yeah, or there's another there's another possibility too, which is that they're so opposed to the fundamental structures of the West That let's say and regard them as so patriarchal and impressive that they'd be willing to take the risk of sacrificing their own free speech Just to have their what have their destructive way something like that We should also acknowledge that in the the New York Times piece that was written which was written by Nellie Bowles who wrote the Infamous piece about you in a enforcement agami That the quote that Jacqueline Hart who is the head of trust and safety over a patreon the court there's no who's no grounding in philosophy or any of the Background training that might be necessary to even remotely begin to participate properly in such a thing No, of course not But so the quote that she gave Nellie in the article said that you can't say these were loosely quoting this now You can't say these words on our platform referring to Carl referring to him saying the n-word in that video Yeah, which we which we know they were using out of context and all that but he never said it on their platform He never said it on patreon He didn't even say it on his own channel that was you know using patreon for the funding So there was a it's almost the entire story was built on quicksand that that tried to put out there on the New York Times Now, of course myself and many other people tweet the hell out of it and gets hundreds and thousands probably retweets and comments to Nellie And and she doesn't respond nor does the New York Times issue any sort of Correction about the most fundamental piece of the story was a lie and they don't have they don't have a problem doing that so that's why this is so layered about speech and finance and Journalists so amazing to see journalists Take one of the things that happened in Canada to me was that you know after I made the initial videos that caused such a political furor was that Once the main journalists in Canada sort of figured out what I was doing They all came out my support like the post media group Which is 200 newspapers all came out to support what I was doing because they realized that well, they're journalists Apart from comedians there isn't anybody who relies more on the principle of free speech to justify and allow their occupation even to exist for the New York Times not to Understand that this threat is also a threat to everything upon which their entire organization has been predicated It is also an indication of that same kind of willful blindness that we've already been discussing But having said that I would still like to say that I think the biggest danger here I really and it it's just made my jaw drop over the last couple of weeks Thinking about it is the fact that the credit card companies are now taking it upon themselves to potentially police the activities of their users It's like my god. Is that really I just I just can't believe that we any sensible person would Think that through and then want to live in a society where your Spending habits are being monitored by the company that basically produces your money Yeah, well think of anything more totalitarian than that to to loosely quote our friend Eric Weinstein Should Republicans be allowed to use roads that that's sort of where we're headed here that every public good Will be eventually decided can have access to it Access to water it should a should an avowed white supremacist right now that is potentially watching this or lives in America somewhere One of the 42 of them should should they have access to water at their home should they allowed to be Electricity at their home or phone lines or all of these things. I mean This is where we're headed especially when you ever expand the definition of that person is They won't in China Right. Well, that's where they're going right? So is that the test case? Well, it I think it's it's an indication that the fact that the Chinese have been tempted into this is also an indication of the temptation That's intrinsic in the technological power The credit card companies are in a weird situation as far as I'm concerned because the only reason they work at all is because people Actually trust them completely It's like oh you're just a proxy for money Like you're a proxy for cash. In fact, that's basically how the MasterCard advertises itself, right? So you're a proxy for cash and the government doesn't watch what you spend your money on except in extraordinarily Extraordinarily limited cases. I mean there are money laundering laws and so forth But that's in direct violation of a law, right? That's part of tracking down criminal activity that has nothing to do so far with With hate speech which by the way is protected by the First Amendment Yeah, so or which means in some sense that it doesn't exist, you know as a legal as a legal Concept right this is my Canada, which is right. We shouldn't gloss over that fact too because you know Jordan We just did however many countries in in Europe and we're gonna go back this spring and it's like Everybody that we met was jealous of the freedoms that we have in the United States relative to speech You know what I mean? Everybody that would come up to us after the show. Holy cow I wish we could say that and I wish we didn't worry about this or that or jokes or the rest of it and we did That video in Oslo where you talked about Dankula and it's like they're jealous of our freedom so we should be very clear here though, you're right because We now have a payment processor issue which is in in direct connection to whatever it is that we're trying to build out here And we're still it's a little amorphous at the moment. Yeah Is that it's changing because a lot of people are saying alright, you guys really want to solve this then you have to go full Crypto. Yeah, the problem video has to be hosted crypto. Yeah Finances have to be hosted or have to be done via crypto. Yeah, all of these things These are these are major major things that we're trying to figure out on every front certain payment Processors are a little more willing to stand up to the mob than others. So we have different people I mean, we'll really go on on every front here. That's right Well the tentative platform that we're trying to build and to build carefully will provide the possibility of multiple payment portals in the hope that the Creators will be less susceptible to being rapidly shut down or perhaps shut down at all But it you know only a fool would say that that problem is going to be definitively solved I have some real and increasing sympathy for the cryptocurrency types, you know But the problem there is that as far as I can tell their solution is still sufficiently technically complex to keep it out of the mainstream use and also Not sufficiently liquid to actually constitute a realistic current replacement even for credit cards Right. So one of the things we've been discussing is that it's almost like we have to have several markers down the road to figure out what the real solution is because Not everything can be solved in terms of terms of service tomorrow related to everyone that exists Not everything can be solved tomorrow related to the payment processors Maybe crypto really is the ultimate answer, but it's not the answer tomorrow for everything. So we're really We're plotting out a lot here, but it seems like a fresh and sort of fitting way to start the year I think so and so for January 15th I mean part of the reason that we picked that date as I said before it was because we thought we might have something to announce with regards to an alternative platform, but you know saner heads have prevailed in that in that Commer heads. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah And also we wanted to give people an opportunity to decide what they wanted to do without just springing it on them I mean, I have some real admiration for Harris for acting so immediately and definitively Yeah, and it's funny, you know, I saw some criticism It's like alright Well Sam dropped immediately and look you and Peterson you're still there and you're talking about this whole thing and it's like We all have different things to consider. We all have different family situations different business situations different livelihood situations everything So it's like we were really trying to just plot this thing out properly and and to be very clear We're still in the process of that So for any of sir for anyone watching this right now if you're supporting Jordan on Patreon or you're supporting me on patreon or both of us or whatever it is It's like now we're trying to shift people because at least by getting off patreon at the moment We've removed one of the middlemen and you can now go directly go to directly to Jordan B Peterson comm or Dave Rubin comm You can at least if you want to donate you can do that for now while we figure out everything else and that way we've Removed one of the pieces here because there's just too many pieces here that that are creating this mess I think it's too much to hope for a perfect solution to a very complex problem and we're muddling through the best we can and hopefully people will regard our decision joint decision to Leave patreon as a step in the right direction however Imperfectly taken. Yeah. Well, look, I think I said it before but I really think that and maybe this will be the defining Idea of 2019 is that I think we're basically at the point where people have to decide what sort of internet they want Yeah, and and it's not only what sort of internet it's really what sort of freedom Do you want in a digital world and either or do you want any or do you want any and maybe maybe you don't or you Don't want to think about it and you just want to play fortnight and watch porn and never think it through But assuming that you'll be allowed to watch porn Right. So now you really are playing or play for that matter, right? So the what do you think that games of violence should be allowed? What makes you think that credit card companies should allow you to use their their funds to purchase First shoot first-person shooter games for example or or any game where anyone is killed. No, you're totally right That's I mean that sounds completely dystopian and yet it seems like that would just be the next Encroachment that we would see here So the point at the end at the end of this is I think everyone for 2019 since the first day of the year It's like you have to think about what type of internet do you want? What type of ability to communicate with other people do you want and if you want something that's a little better than what we've got Right now we better stand up quick because this window we know it's closing slowly But we never know when it's gonna really slap shot quick So so we're working on it and and I think people are ready to stand up with us I really do we might also suggest to people and this is of course up to everyone who's viewing this to decide but you know couple of thousand letters to MasterCard and PayPal and Visa indicating pronounced displeasure at their plans to become Custodians of the monetary supply for ethical reasons might also be in order, you know, these companies are Responsive to public pressure which is perhaps partly why they're determining to play the role of censor to begin with, you know They're they are facing pressure from these Let's call them activist interest groups who again are outlined on change the terms on the website change the terms and they're responding to Public pressure and to some that's understandable It's understandable but But inexcusable in certain in a certain regard But the right way perhaps to begin to push back is to let the credit card companies know that there's a constituency on the other side that I Suspect constitutes the vast majority of credit card users the silent middle majority of Let's say Western society who are neither radically right nor radically left who would just as soon not have their spending habits monitored by giant corporations To that the left is so opposed to corporate entities, you know on principle especially the sizable ones and you don't have a certain justification for being skeptical about the moral direction of very large organizations Are so eager to hand over the reins of social control to precisely the companies You'd think they would be least likely to crawl into bed with I mean really MasterCard and Visa Like right or at the same time they'll they want to hand over more control to the government to handle these things and and we Should be pretty clear that in the last couple weeks that we've been discussing this every single discussion that we've had About this. I don't think once did we entertain the idea of oh, we've got to get the government involved to fix this thing I mean there there could be as you as you referenced earlier there could be specific legal Issues that pop up related to collusion and a couple other things cartel developer. Yeah, like that sort of thing Yeah, but but the beauty of this and again why I'm so I'm watching my my monthly rev of my company go down Even though we're making some of it back But as I'm watching that happen as I said to you last time, I'm incredibly inspired right now because literally Thousands of emails are pouring in from people that want to work with us that want to help us that want to Figure out how to fund things or that want to work as engineers or the rest of it and that tells you that that people are people are afraid and they see this problem and they just want some solutions and and Maybe there isn't an easy solution as you said I don't think I've also been talking with you online with a whole bunch of the people who've been loosely aggregated under the aegis of the intellectual dark web and and that's probably 30 people that that we've been communicating with with a variety of peripheral people and it's also useful to let people know that everyone of those people is Unbelievably concerned about what happened to Carl Benjamin to start Sargon and even more so dumbstruck by the collusion of the payment processing companies and and the emergence of this activist infrastructure online that's devoted specifically to the suppression of Free speech. Yeah, and also we should also note that within that group of say 30 of some odd people we all sort of Look, we agree on basic fundamental principles related to free speech and things like that But there's a lot of disagreement on how to move forward with this I mean, we're talking it out respectfully as we always do but some people are saying stay in fight on patreon because this is how You know, they're small enough say that you might get them to change some people are saying you gotta go Some people are saying some version You know mixing those two and nobody's clear about the proper pathway forward. Yeah, but that's again I mean, I think this is what the brilliance of human ingenuity is all about It's like would there gonna be some pitfalls in front of us and staying would have its risks and leaving would have its risks And we're all gonna do what we think is right. We've already discussed that too, right? is that there's a there's no there's no no risk option here and like and So we're taking the risk of leaving and then we're gonna make the best of it I mean often when you take a risky often in life All you have is a choice between two different risks and sometimes neither of them are risks you would like to take then in the aftermath of the decision a new field of possibility opens up in front of you too and whether or not you made the right decision is actually a consequence of how well you manage the aftermath of the decision So we'll we'll keep talking over the next couple of months and on like I've got good people Working on this alternative You know which which was as I mentioned in other places Started seven months ago or so and good people supervising it Whether it'll turn out to be a viable product and whether or not we can figure out how to implement it in a sustainable way That actually addresses these issues in a reasonable manner remains to be seen Yeah Hey on a personal note just because you know I got to see you a couple days before Christmas in West Palm Beach and and we had dinner with with your family and your kids And everything hasn't it sort of been nice because I did a week with with my brother and sister and nieces and nephews over Christmas Also sort of circling back to family on some of this it's given me a lot of perspective Because I'm getting I'm getting reached out by so many different people on all different fronts But then to have sort of a close-knit group of people that really do have your interests in mind and all those things Yeah, we're just with your kids at dinner. It was like oh these are good people to There's unanimity on the part of the people around me that the proper thing to do is well twofold one is to separate myself from patreon in accordance with our discussions and the second is to Proceed with exceeding caution and not over promise Or try to deliver too quickly a solution although to work on that carefully, so that's what we've decided to do Yeah, so let's just be crystal clear on that latter part. We are working on this. We're gonna be deliberate We're gonna be cautious. We understand that it can't be solved tomorrow We understand that there's a financial part a free speech part and everything else And we're just gonna lay these things out in front of us and we're gonna keep working through them with a lot of the People that you guys know and trust and and and and with with some other people and hearing from random people that have given us Ideas, I mean I've been forwarding you emails left and right where people are like, you know This might be the the pressure point you might want to go out here. So we're just gonna keep going. Yep Yep, okay. Well, I got a couple of things to end this I guess let's summarize and then I've got a couple of things just to let people know about Sure What the first is so we're both leaving on January 15th and the second is we're working on this platform and The third is a warning to people to keep a close eye on what the credit card companies are up to because that's a really bad thing in my estimation I Guess that's probably it on my front. I have a talk coming up in Zurich I have a couple of talks in California in January. Yeah, I'll be with you on those Yep, and the tickets to those are available on my website at Jordan B Peterson calm The final thing is I also set up with my partners as a New Year's Token, let's say that future authoring program from the self-authoring suite And we put it up at 50% off with the code NY 2019 and so if anybody's out there wants to make some personal What do you call those resolutions for the new year then this program is an ideal way of doing that and so that's also partly a thank you to everyone who Has been so supportive and interested in the last year and so I think that's basically I Think that's basically that what do you know? All right. No, I think that's basically it. So I'll just quickly You know give a shout out to Dave Rubin comm slash donate and what we're what we're trying to do And I know you're trying to do this as well Is that for whoever signs up now and we're taking it's one time and monthly donations that you can do There are going to be ways that we think once we build out whatever it is We're working on that that it'll all be able to be flipped into that So it's not like we're gonna have people constantly having to start new accounts or or you know sign up for new things or anything Like that. We're trying to make this as easy as possible for everybody and they'll look there's gonna be some bumps, but This is it that's one day say about 2019 there's gonna be There's gonna be some bumps. Well, I don't know if you know this Jordan, but we got an American election coming the year after that. So Okay, mr. Rubin happy new year, all right, happy new year brother I'll see you in Cali in a couple weeks Bye for now
