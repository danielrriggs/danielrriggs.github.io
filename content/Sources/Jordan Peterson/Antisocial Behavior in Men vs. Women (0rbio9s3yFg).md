 When I studied antisocial behavior, and particularly at McGill, I studied female and male antisocial behavior. Male antisocial behavior tends to be much more physically violent. And so most of the people who are imprisoned are male, mostly because we imprison violent offenders, which is kind of interesting. We don't necessarily imprison white collar criminals, even if they defraud like 60,000 people, but you know, a mugger, well, we're gonna lock them up. And yeah, I can understand that, although not entirely. Defrauding 60,000 people out of their pension isn't exactly nothing either. But in any case, it's almost all men in prison, and it's almost all violent offenders. What's the female equivalent of antisocial personality? And it's much more subtle. But a lot of it is reputation destruction and exclusion, Mean Girls Syndrome.
