 Hello everyone, as you may or may not know, I'm in the middle of a rather extensive international tour. I have a couple of lectures that still have tickets available, and so maybe you'd like to attend. I understand that there are some people for whom my mere presence in the same global hemisphere provokes fits of pique and resentment. Don't let that discourage you. I want to let those of you who are interested know that tickets to two events are still available. At the Ice Hall in Helsinki, Finland on Sunday, October 9th, the other rather newly announced, at the Honda Centre in Anaheim, California on Thursday, November 3rd. Everyone is of course welcome to attend, regardless of their political beliefs. Thank you. Hope to see you there.
