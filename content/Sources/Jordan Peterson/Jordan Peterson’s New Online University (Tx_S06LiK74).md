 And then with my daughter, Michaela, I've started this Peterson Academy and our plan. We want to drive the cost of a bachelor's degree down to $4,000. We've got 30 professors on board so far. I've been able to identify stellar lecturers from all over the world. They give four two-hour lectures on whatever they really want to teach about. The rule is we'll put an audience together for you in the studio. We want you to teach what you love at the edge of your ability. We'll offer that to as many people as we possibly can. We're pursuing accreditation. What we'll do is take two or three of those eight-hour lectures, bundle them together. That'll give you one university credit. We've developed a good app that adds a social component to it so that people can discuss the lectures while they're watching them and, you know, can make social contacts and maybe have meet-up groups in different cities. And then we're going to set the grading system in stone. So the grade you'll get for this university will be your performance. So there'll be no grade inflation. We're hoping that a degree from this university will indicate to employers a true level of competence. We're going to roll that out, we hope, in November.
