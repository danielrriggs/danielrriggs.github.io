 It's not all that happens though when they eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil because it's not called The fruit of the tree of the knowledge of nakedness It's called the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and I thought about that for a tremendous amount of time It's like what in the world because I assume these old stories make sense, you know, it's a game I play It's like they're old. They've been around a long time. I'm not sure why they're there. But there they are They're at the basis of our culture like many many of the stories that we depend on depend on them Our whole culture grew out of their roots, let's say and so I Assume that our ancestors who managed to survive conditions that would have done a lot of us in very rapidly I can tell you we're a lot smarter than we think and that the mysterious processes that That produced these stories and compelled us to remember them are a lot more Psychologically significant than we generally tend to presume So I give them the benefit of the doubt and try to understand why it is that they might make sense Instead of assuming that they don't and that that's not easy As their complicated stories and so I thought about this nakedness Knowledge of good and evil idea for a very very long time like about 20 years Puzzling it out was what the hell's the relationship between discovering that you're naked and discovering good and evil and then one day mostly because of studying totalitarianism Totalitarianism and the atrocity that proclivity for people to commit atrocity in the service of their group belief Or maybe just because that's what they were like Clued me in and I thought I see this is one of the things that really makes people different than animals It's like, you know It's one thing to realize that you're naked to realize that you're naked means that you know that you're limited in time and space That you're mortal and that you're you're subject to degeneration and to social Humiliation and to your own harsh judgment all of that nakedness to know that you're Vulnerable against the world and definitely a source of shame because of that and And a felt lack of self-sufficiency and then no wonder and no wonder It's understandable. But the other thing is is that this is and this is the rub. It's like if you're out in the veld and you're not being very careful and a hungry lion jumps on you and Eats you you don't really think of the lion as evil. I mean you might write at that moment, but you know Philosophically, it's not evil. It's just hungry and as soon as it's not hungry then It goes and has a sleep and it's not up to some malevolent trick. It's it's done for the day but human being that's a whole different sort of creature and because human being is capable of doing terrible things to someone else and Consciously so I think well, what's the connection between that and nakedness itself and it seems to be this is like Here's the thing is that once I realize that I can be hurt, you know I have a self-conscious model of my own vulnerability Then I can generalize that to other people I can think oh, this is interesting Here's how I can be hurt by myself. Here's how I can be hurt by society Here's how I can be hurt by nature and by the unknown and what that implies is that well you can be hurt with exactly the same mechanisms and that immediately becomes part of my What would you say my repertoire of ability and then all of a sudden the world is no longer a walled a Walled garden and a well watered place But it's a moral story because with that ability to inflict Suffering comes the knowledge of good and evil as far as I'm concerned Those are identical propositions because now we have the choice a deep choice about how we're going to treat ourselves in each other we can inflict tremendous pain and suffering on each other in a very voluntary and and conscious manner in in a way that no other animal can manage and that's the dawning of the moral sense that capacity we now have to choose to Mitigate or exaggerate suffering and and that's not all but it's a huge part of it
