 I'm making this video to say hi to my viewers and listeners in China And also to wish them happy new year. I Was prompted to do so by miss Mengjie Na a Chinese student studying in Germany Who has worked diligently to translate and subtitle a number of my videos I've placed links to those in the description of this video Mengjie has also organized a number of people to work on the translations They have a group on Weibo, which I have linked to in the description. Thanks Mengjie much appreciated I would also like to announce that my new book 12 rules for life will be translated into Chinese and published by Beijing Cheers books. I don't know the publication date yet, but I will let everyone know as soon as I do Links to the publisher are also in the description I am extremely pleased to hear that my lectures are finding an audience in China and happy new year to everyone there Bye for now
