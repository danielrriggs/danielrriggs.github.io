 When I talk to people about doing the future authoring program they often put it off, and it's not surprising because it's hard and And be it but it's more than that they think well. I don't know how to write I'm going to do a bad job. I don't really like assignments. I'm going to have to do it perfectly I need to wait till I have enough time and Like one of those is enough to stop you cold and all five of them You're just done and so I tell people do it haphazardly a tiny bit at a time and badly Because you can do that I tell my students when they're doing their thesis master's thesis Write a really bad first draft and then we have a little conversation about that because they don't think I mean that Because it sounds like a cliche in some sense. It's not a cliche. It's not a cliche at all it means You're a terrible writer But if someone put a gun to your head and said you have to have your hundred page thesis done by next Monday Or I'll shoot you, but I don't care how terrible it is You would sit down and write it and the thing is then you have it right then then you have something and then you can Fix it you can iterate and fix it that bad first draft. That's the most valuable thing and so that's what you need you need a bad first draft of yourself and There's there's an idea that Jung developed about the trickster and the jester the comedian right that the trickster is the precursor to the Savior That's one of the things I learned from Jung that was just it's so unlikely you never think that it's so amazing that that might be the case but the the the satirical and the ironic and and the Troublemaker that the comedian the fool the fool is the precursor to the Savior Why because you're a fool when you start something new and So if you're not willing to be a fool then you'll never start anything new and if you never start anything new then you Won't develop and so the willingness to be a fool is the precursor to transformation And that's the same as humility and so if you're gonna write your destiny you can do a bad first job You're gonna get smarter as you move forward. That's the thing is that so something beckons to you That's what happens here Maybe the star that you pet a wished on was the wrong damn star But at least it was a star right at least it was in the sky at least it moved him forward And so you say in your life was something grips you and and and fills you with interest and you think well should I do that? And the answer is if not that then something What if it's a mistake? It's a mistake rest assured. What do you know you're gonna stumble around right? And what's gonna happen is this you're gonna move to you're gonna not stay in stasis You're not gonna wander around in circles, and I see people like that. They said well. I never knew what to do and now I'm 40 It's like that's not so good That's not so good, and you might say well, and there is a literature too that suggests that people are a lot more Unhappy when they look back in their lives About the things they didn't do then they are about the mistakes They made while they were doing things and so that's really worth thinking about too because there's Redemptive mistakes and a redemptive mistake would be a mistake that you make when you go out and try to do something You know you actually you think okay? I'm gonna try to do this when you're not good at it you make a bunch of mistakes It's like what's the consequence if you pay attention is you're not quite so stupid anymore That's the thing is you've been informed by your by the results of your errors, and so what happens is? You you you follow the beacon you follow the light and You're blind so you don't know where the light is it's it's dimly Apprehended only and you're afraid to follow it But you decide to take some stumbling steps towards it and as you take stumbling steps towards it you become illuminated and enlightened and informed Because of the nature of your experience because you're pushing yourself beyond where you are and you're going into the country that you have not Yet been in and you learn something and so what happens then is the star moves You move ten feet towards it you think no that's not right. I didn't get it right. It isn't there It's actually there, and so then you you see it somewhere else And you shift yourself slightly and you move forward and that's what happens is that You continue as you change the thing that guides you forward moves Right it's like God in the in the in the desert in Egypt the pillar of light that you're following it's moving It's not a permanent thing you move towards it it moves away It guides you forward and so you say well is what I'm aiming at paradise itself And the answer to that is no because what do you know you you couldn't see paradise if it was right in front of you But you might get a glimmer of it And so you move towards it and you grow and then the next time you open your eyes You see a little bit more clearly and that's what happens is that just happens over and over right it keeps moving And so you move like this But the thing that's so cool is that all those zigs and zags you say and each of those zags is and zigs is a Catastrophe I hit a wall my god, and then I had to die a little bit, and I barely got back up It's a phoenix transformation at each at each turn and it's painful But the thing is is that even though you've you've traveled 20 miles Let's say on that road, and you've only moved three miles forward you've moved three miles forward Instead of falling backwards because that's the thing too is that if you stand still you fall backwards You cannot stand still because the world moves away from you if you stand still and there's no Stasis there's only backwards and so if you're not moving backwards back forwards, then you're moving backwards and that's more More of the underlying truth of the Matthew principle to those who have everything more will be given From those who have nothing everything will be taken. It's a warning do not stay in one place Well as you say can say maybe then Maybe the cataclysm of each transformation starts to lessen There's not so much of you that has to die with every mistake And maybe you end up oriented at least reasonably properly And if you were sensible that would have been your trip, but it wasn't right It's that and perhaps. It's a lot worse than that perhaps. There's no shortage of backtracking But it doesn't matter because as you stumble forward you you illuminate and inform yourself and perhaps that's partly because the world is made of information and if you encounter it and tangle with it then it informs you and then you become informed and then your information and then you're ready
