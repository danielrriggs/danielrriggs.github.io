 You've treated MS? We have, but MS is much more tricky because there is an autoimmune component to it. There's a lot of other components to it and that's where it becomes, you have to take a holistic approach. So the way we're going to treat MS, which we're working on, is we're going to have the second generation of stem cells. So what that means is instead of just using umbilical core stem cells, we create what are called gene edited stem cells. So we can actually take, so this is what Professor Yamanaka in Japan, he won a Nobel Prize in 2014 for what's called discovery of pluripotent stem cells, IPSCs. So what he discovered was that you could take any somatic cell in your body, like a muscle, a scan cell, and you can reprogram it using genetic reprogramming and turn it back into an embryonic stem cell. Oh yeah.
