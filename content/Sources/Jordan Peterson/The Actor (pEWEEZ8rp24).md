 Now they're planning the climb of the century. Well, what will it be? Just as globally we've agreed to a minimum corporate tax, we must work together to ensure it is no longer free to pollute anywhere in the world. That means establishing a shared minimum standard for pricing pollution. Of course, what's even better than pricing emissions is ensuring that they don't happen in the first place. Which brings me to my next major commitment. We'll cap oil and gas sector emissions today and ensure they decrease tomorrow at a pace and scale needed to reach net zero by 2050. That's no small task for a major oil and gas producing country. It's a big step that's absolutely necessary. The actor.

Tell me Mr. Trudeau, are the unsophisticated rednecks of Alberta not setting to rise in anger against the damned P-supers of Quebec? What exactly are you doing in Glasgow? Saving the world? Are not our flags at half-mast? You have a country to run. Get home. Make peace. Do your job. God help me if my vision in this regard is clouded by my own presumption. But I see an actor, not a real boy. You You You You
