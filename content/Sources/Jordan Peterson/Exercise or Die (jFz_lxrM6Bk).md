 If you're a person who's in the doing zero exercise per week camp, the very good news is the benefit you get from going from zero to three hours a week is a greater benefit than anyone gets along the exercise curve. Taking someone who's at five hours and taking them to 15 will produce less relative benefit than going from zero to three. So in other words, I want that person to see some real incentive for making this change. Secondly, I'll put some numbers to it, right? So going from no exercise to three hours a week approximately reduces your cause of, your all-cause mortality, that is to say death by every cause, by 50% at any moment in time. So if you're standing there asking, what's the probability I'm gonna die this year? Well, we can sort of actuarially figure that out. You get to cut that number in half by simply going from zero to three hours exercise a week if you're a non-exerciser.
