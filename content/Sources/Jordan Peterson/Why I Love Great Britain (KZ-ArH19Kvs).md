 I recently Was invited to Cambridge University in the UK and spent two weeks partly there partly at Oxford and then partly at a variety of remarkable places in the UK and then I came back to North America, and I was asked by a newspaper to Contribute an article that was in some manner related to my visit and so I wrote it and the newspaper wanted to edit it a lot and so I Found another newspaper that would accept it the way I wrote it and because I I wanted to say what I had to say about it and I'm gonna read it to you because Well that way you can listen to it, and maybe you'll find that useful. It's called. It's very un- Stylish, let's say why I love Great Britain Of all the twists and turns that my life has taken over the last few years one of the most truly upsetting and surreal was learning that I had been Peremptorily disinvited from one of the UK's great universities in 2018 when I last traveled to the UK I met with several Cambridge professors and began to discuss the possibility of Arranging a seminar there focusing on some key biblical texts a formal offer of a visiting fellowship was proffered to me in February of 2019 facilitated by Dr. Douglas Headley professor of the philosophy of religion at Clare College and Arranged through the necessary actions on the part of Cambridge and the University of Toronto in the fall of 2016 I had rented a 500 seat theatre on a whim you might say in Toronto, Canada and delivered 15 90 minute public lectures every week a different lecture entitled the psychological significance of the biblical stories Surprisingly all 15 lectures attracted a sold-out house Furthermore the majority of the audience consisted of young men a notoriously difficult audience to attract to such things the initial lecture introduction to the idea of God focused on the first two sentences of the book of Genesis Those who came to watch and listen walked their way with me through the remainder of that great book during the remaining 2014 by the close of 2018 when initial arrangements were being made Rema fellowship some four million people had watched the first lecture on YouTube with a multitude more Listening on my podcast the series has now been viewed or watched 40 million times It has in addition attracted widespread positive response from Christian Catholics Protestants and Orthodox believers alike even widespread positive critical response as well as large swaths of the orthodox Jewish and Islamic faithful In a further unexpected twist The lectures have also proved popular with those who regard themselves as explicitly Atheistic I recount this only to explain why the initial invitation from Cambridge was proffered It has proved increasingly difficult for those concerned about our traditional and religious heritage to propagate their message their ideas to the modern community and the success of my strange venture generated some great curiosity After the success of the Genesis venture I had the ambition to continue my investigations and discussion With the book of Exodus knowing that I am an amateur in such matters being possessed of no training in formal theology I thought it would be prudent to test my knowledge and understanding in a setting that would challenge what I was assuming and potentially rectify my profound remaining ignorance I Therefore set out with my would-be Cambridge hosts to hear the opinions of those who had made the study of divinity Their central calling before I presumed to reengage upon my lecture series It was a great honor for me and I say this most truly to be offered this opportunity as a psychologist and an academic interloper My invitation raised some hackles behind the scenes however Based on what I would call a willfully blind misinterpretation of my putative political views in consequence the invitation was unceremoniously rescinded on an excuse which I later learned had been manufactured after the fact this happened Conveniently as well as treacherously When dr. Headley my sponsor was absent conducting his affairs in India I Discovered that I had been canceled not as a formal notification But accidentally on Twitter To say the least this was a shock Earlier this year however I received an invitation to return in the aftermath of my Canceling and other two similar incidents an intense battle had been waged to make the sort of gratuitous Forbidding that had been applied to me impossible a group of Cambridge dawns arose to challenge and Reword a set of revisions to the university policy on free speech that would have Ironically if that word is strong enough made future similar cancellations both easier and more likely Then they attempted to find 25 people who would have fixed their names to a petition that forced a full Anonymous and binding vote on the matter this specific effort took months people were afraid to sign Afraid that making their support for such a change public would expose them to sanctions similar in consequence to those that befell me afraid that they would be mobbed and cancelled but enough people Eventually did so and the matter was duly brought forward to Regent House Cambridge's ultimate governing body and when the vote was called an Unusually large proportion of those eligible to cast their ballots turned out to make their opinions known Almost nine out of ten of the fifteen hundred or so who voted did so in a manner that made such cancellations impossible in the future Larger margin of victory than any of the academics I spoke with about such issues of governance could recall obviously Something was transpiring of far broader significance than the mere revoking of my individual fellowship offer and so to the first of many reasons why I love Great Britain Cambridge like Oxford from which it is descended much as it dislikes to admit it Has a highly decentralized college structure both great institutions are more a loose collection of autonomous colleges each with their own history tradition architecture peculiarities of self-government and educational aims This arrangement allows for maximal liberty and creativity and thought and action at the most vitally important level the local While simultaneously enabling an optimal level of cross-college rivalry and cooperation Furthermore and most significantly this free and loose organizational structure makes bureaucratic capture of the entire institutions extremely difficult This in turn makes the rectification of mistakes which will inevitably Be made possible and even likely and that might just be the salvation of the rapidly corrupting modern University as well as everything downstream from that culture and that is everything and the rebellion at that august institution and elsewhere Against the ideological forces currently threatening free discourse and inquiry in the academy Mark my words My wife and I returned to Cambridge on November 17th I attended a number of seminars there delivered to public lectures as I did a week later at Oxford where I'd also been invited to Meet and speak and teach I used these opportunities to discuss and test a proposition key to the body of thought I have been developing and communicating about for many decades That we all perceive the world not as a set of self-evident objective material facts, but as a system of meaning and That we do so by applying a framework which when described is a narrative a story I proposed to the university of Cambridge Indescribed is a narrative a story I Proposed further that this fact has profound even revolutionary implications for how we understand science and technology and for how we conceptualize ourselves existentially in the world these ideas were markedly Well received. I also had the great privilege of talking for several hours while at Oxford first to Sir Roger Penrose Perhaps the world's most renowned living physicist and then to dr. Richard Dawkins Who is rather uniquely a fellow both of the original Royal Society and honor bestowed upon outstanding? Scientists and of the Royal Society of literature Founded in 1820 by King George to reward literary merit and excite literary talent Dr. Dawkins is as well perhaps the world's most famous and influential atheist Dr. Penrose and I along with Dr. Stephen Blackwood who served as mediator discussed his fascinating artistic proclivity for geometric tiling an endeavor related in my opinion to the relationship between mapping a territory and the territory itself I Spoke with dr. Penrose Mostly to inquire and learn as his knowledge roams far afield from mine And was well rewarded in my efforts as our conversation literally spanned the micro and macro cosmic realms I spoke with dr. Dawkins after long tentative and increasingly amicable Correspondence beforehand to clarify my ignorance of his well-defended positions particularly in relationship to his opposition To religious belief and behavior suffice it to say in the latter case that we have much more to talk about I greatly enjoyed both opportunities And will be releasing a video recording of the former and an audio of the latter in the very near future I believe that these conversations Went very well. I certainly found them intensely engrossing and informative And I regarded as another great privilege and opportunity to place them online Where they will be made available to millions of avid listeners around the world I can do that Because I'm a free-speaking citizen of Canada member of the British Commonwealth and Except for our own sporadic and inexcusable foolishness a country shaped to the core by the English common-law tradition Furthermore I can make those discussions and all my talks and seminars at Oxbridge available on YouTube the technologically revolutionary platform invented by Americans Who are even at the time of the revolution and are still now in some real sense? sovereign British citizens insisting on their due and intrinsic rights and What would the world be? Without the recognition of those rights Stifling web of intrigue a system of archaic dynasties a tribal mess of clans steeped in nepotism Warring with one another for access to the short-term exigencies of power I Realize that there are other lights in the world apart from the UK and its subsidiaries and once dependents Although I would argue that even the European countries that profess respect for freedom of speech and thought in reality fealty to the divine word both secular and Inescapably religious have done so in no small part because of the influence of that great land and the fact that dr Dawkins and I came armed so to speak with radically different viewpoints and conceptions was a spur to our very productive Conversation and not an impediment And the fact that such discussions and their dissemination are possible Throughout so much of the world rather than positively forbidden and fatally dangerous is another one of the reasons I love Great Britain My talks at both Cambridge and Oxford Appeared uniformly welcome to faculty and students alike Now with a single exception a rather courageous and comic young woman dressed in a full-body lobster suit Who popped in during my most public talk at Cambridge to shout feminism and dance briefly about? Why was that reception? so positive uniform and manifold When I was apparently ignorant and malevolent enough to be banned from the world Reband from the campus only two short years ago the students at Cambridge remained seated when I entered the hall Just prior to my first talk Although they had lined up down the block for most of the day beforehand Well the Oxford crowd anxious as they are not to be outdone Gave me an overwhelmingly moving Standing ovation before I spoke there. I say that not in triumph I hope as that would be the sort of pride that deservedly invites a fall Although I might need to confess occasionally harboring at least a quizzical smile about such things such a public response seems at curious odds with the idea so invidiously insisted upon that I was and am a fundamentally maligned person Characterized by literally unacceptable Political opinions the same mode of interaction Made itself evident in what were many dozens of encounters with individual students on the streets and in the colleges at Oxbridge No fear No disgust no contempt No hatred Just a series of extremely inviting pleasant and often surprisingly deep and intimate individual encounters with fine mostly young people striving with all due effort upward and onward informing me forthrightly That they were doing so perhaps an inquiring and curious journalist could discuss among other issues The fact of my fellowship revocation the Regent House vote and The positive response to my presence at Cambridge with the soon to depart vice-chancellor another Canadian We are a pesky and intrusive lot Professor Stephen to whose precipitous retirement from the glorious UK academic and cultural scene was somewhat Synchronistically timed given the aforementioned vote and my subsequent reinvitation or perhaps it could be discussed all of it with a tiny number of individuals still meddling madly and Unrepentantly behind the scenes who orchestrated the whole false thing in the beginning And the fact that a journalist could inquire about such things is yet another reason why I love Great Britain With its profound commitment to the idea that the curious have the right to interrogate and investigate those who have been granted authority or usurped power After our university sojourn after having been granted access to the original writings of Charles Darwin and Isaac Newton After attending the most beautiful imaginable choir accompanied services at the magnificent chapels gracing both institutions after Walking down the hallowed historical halls of higher learning in a setting constantly overwhelming and remarkable for a mere colonial Accustomed to history on a much more minor scale my wife, and I were privileged to tour the British Parliament Accompanied by one of the peers of the realm She was great If I might be so bold to say so everything a hopeful outsider Uncorrupted by the pervasive cynicism that corrupts our time might have wished for kind charitable engaging Unpretentious articulate elegant and possessed of that wonderful accent Bestowing upon its possessor the immediate impression of high intelligence In the palace of Westminster. I stopped for a moment at the precise center of The heart of that remarkable building and lifted my eyes upwards directly under the immense chandelier suspended under the beautiful and ornate domed octagonal ceiling I Understood then that I was standing at the base of the realization in stone Wood and the air itself of the cosmic tree It Brazil itself the Liana Joining heaven and earth the object of the most ancient of sacred visions and religious transports the very lifeline between the transcendent heavens above and the suffering and fallen earth Itself if I could have asked for something more to befall me at that moment It would have been the music of the divine to accompany that vision perhaps Bach's great third Brandenburg concerto Although I would have settled for the British national anthem God save the Queen that lobby is most certainly not The untrustworthy corrupt and damnable site of power dominance and oppression But the very place where the practical redemption of a great people is continually undertaken governed by the transcendent and necessary principle of the unalienable right to express the logos as conscience soul and rationality itself dictate that lobby enshrined in that palace the The cardinal Castle of the word has been a very light unto the world realized there simultaneously in stone tradition and living action It is the very place where the sovereign voice of the people meets the voice of its representatives To be carried forth into its eventual incarnation into the body of laws We separately and jointly accept adopt and act out We are all carriers of the temptation to resentment and the desire to compel and force those who disagree with our presumptions That poses an eternal threat to the integrity of our souls and our societies We are all possessed by the attributes of the Auschwitz capo the gulag trustee the willingness to turn away and to consciously deceive and the capacity to delight in oppression and cruelty We are each and all of us tainted by the blood that soaks our soil But the people of Great Britain have granted the world a gift whose power stands in permanent opposition To our most appalling proclivities as individuals and societies that gift is the political expression of the sanctification? of the word freedom in speech imagination and thought Freedom to engage in the very process that builds and rebuilds habitable order itself from the chaos That eternally surrounds us and that freedom is expressed in many ways small and great in the British Isles in the wit of its people In the effectiveness of its institutions in the beauty of its art and literature in the political and psychological presumptions that guide private discourse and public conception and action and That is most particularly why I love Great Britain and that is why people of that realm and not only of that realm You should love her too spite her sins With your eyes lifted upward your hope to the future and the word of truth and faith on your tongues I Love your country Rule Britannia indeed
