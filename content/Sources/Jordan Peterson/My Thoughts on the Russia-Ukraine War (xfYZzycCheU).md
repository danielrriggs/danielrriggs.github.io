 I think it's a catastrophe that we didn't integrate Russia into NATO when we had the opportunity because we had the opportunity and we squandered it and that was a big mistake and God only knows what we're going to pay for that I'm very nervous about the fall because the food front looks dismal The best projections I've encountered suggest that 150 million people will be hungry by the fall and that'll mean mass migration into Europe Minimum, apart from the deaths, which fall particularly heavily on children We've got a mess on our hands
