 Hello everyone, I'm in Miami today on my tour. It's the end of January I've been watching what's happening in Canada over the last 10 days. Let's say or a month before that too Wondering what's going on and trying to think it through. I thought I'd make a video today message to Premier Scott no and Jason Kenny and Doug Ford and Leader of Her Majesty's loyal opposition Aaron O'Toole and ask you guys what in the world are you waiting for? It's your moment You've got a huge number of Canadians occupying Ottawa Expressing their dismay with the suspension of our Charter rights in the face of this so-called emergency our Prime Minister has Literally abandoned the city run away as far as I can tell citing security concerns because I think he believes his own propaganda about the nature of the people who are sitting in Ottawa and Then lying about it Justifying it as a consequence of being exposed to kovat despite the fact. He's double vaccinated and tested negative You're not gonna get a better opportunity. This is your moment conservatives in Canada You could come out and say to the population say to the people who are desperate to hear this that We can have our lives returned to normal and that there's still some danger But that we've got this with competent leadership and care We could return our lives to what they should be we could have our country back We could move forward into the future in a normal manner so gentlemen Premier Scott moe Jason Kenny Doug Ford your good men Aaron O'Toole. You're the leader of the opposition Man even the NDP leader came out and said that the truckers were essentially a bunch of white supremacists for For all intents and purposes the opposition your opposition our government is in disarray and The people are doing everything they can to make their wants known guys reassure Canadians remove these Mandates that are crippling our businesses and interfering with our private lives and stopping us from being able to travel seize the day
