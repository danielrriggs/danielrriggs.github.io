 We're going to see a lot of starvation and of course this leads to pandemic We'll have real pandemics because again when you have many people starving there first of all They start migrating and eating things They don't normally eat and their immune systems are depressed Anyway, bottom line is every time you get big famines you get big pandemics Well good, then we can lock everybody then we can lock everybody down again. Hey, that would be real fun We can lock everybody down again like they did in Shanghai and then we can disrupt the supply chains any Even more and then we can starve a bunch more people and maybe we will settle out with 600 million people and have a sustainable Planet, you know with all those 600 million people living in the ashes and the skeletons Hi everybody, it's my pleasure and privilege today to be speaking with Correspondent Michael Jaan I reached out to Michael because I've been extremely interested in the European civil protests Specifically those centering in at the moment in the Netherlands inspired in no small part by the Canadian truckers convoy Those those protests are receiving short shrift and minimal coverage in What has been come to known as the legacy media which is more and more In a collusional relationship, let's say with the with the globalist utopians who are attempting to guide our destiny so destructively and unsuccessfully I Reached out to Michael because I want to find out to the degree that I can What's going on particularly in the Netherlands and more broadly in Europe and around the world and he's a cardinal person to Talk to in this regard and he's a very interesting person in his own right for all sorts of reasons Which we'll get into as we progress Michael was one of America's youngest green berets That's not an easy thing to manage at 19 years old He spent more than half his life overseas in more than 80 countries. So he's been everywhere man and has seen many things Mr. Jaan is also the author of three books published in the United States including moment of truth in Iraq 2016 and three others in Japan covering among other topics the present and developing information war with China He is America's most experienced combat Correspondent not necessarily a title for the faint of heart. Let's say most recently as I said And this is the proximal reason for this discussion Michael has been tracking and covering the rising tide of civil disobedience in the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe So thank you Michael very much for coming in to talk to me today I understand that you're in the Netherlands right now You've been there for a couple of weeks and so tell us a little bit about yourself and and what why you're in the Netherlands and what? You've been seeing and what you think it means Yes, sir Jordan and thank you for inviting me on I've watched your show for years now, it's it's incredible to come on Yeah, and you mentioned the Canadian truckers that their courage cannot be in their inspiration cannot be understated You know courage is courageous as is cowardice. And so we must display courage Recently some months ago earlier this year I drove from California to Washington DC with American truckers Who were inspired by Canadian truckers and they were flying Canadian flags all these are American truckers and Americans over bridges I must have seen hundreds of thousands flying Almost as many Canadian flags as Americans you may have seen it on the news while the news sort of blockaded it No, no, we never see anything like that on the news in Canada because yeah our media is so subsidized by the government that we anything that runs against government dictates and I hate to say that about a country like Canada is just Minimally or minimally covered or not covered at all? I had no idea that the connect that the American truckers were flying Canadian flags You think that'd be news in Canada because isn't it news when Canada becomes interesting and in fact I know almost nothing about the truckers convoy in the US to Washington and I do try to follow the news Jordan that the the truckers a convoy in the United States from California to Washington It was actually pretty massive and I was there every step of the way and so many Canadian flags You wouldn't believe it hanging off bridges sides of the roads even in blue states And and it was all from inspiration from Canada and so yeah again courage is courageous cowardice is courageous and the Americans were very Proud to follow the lead of Canadians and so again, this is spreading across the world Yeah, well, that's amazing. They don't even know it do they they don't even know it because they don't know they have any truckers to know it No, no, they have no idea and and that's really sad You know that we're in a situation where we could have that be something that that we don't know and so Well, that's part of what puts us in the situation that we're in Okay, so you were with the American truckers when they went to Washington. What sort of effect do you think they had? It was galvanizing. Of course, you know, it's just one one battle of many of awareness at that point you know that and I spent so much time with the truckers because in every country that I go to I want to know What the farmers think I go straight to farmers I want to know what people like truckers think law enforcement military that sort of thing You know the basic pulse of the of the countries that I go to and so yeah It had a good effect. It's certainly as you know, this is a long road You've been talking about this for years and it's you've been fighting this battle for years and you know It's a knockdown drag-out fight and it goes on but you've mentioned I've watched some of your recent programs You you acknowledge that we're actually making progress against the weff and the other they call them weff You know that World Economic Forum the WF in Netherlands. They call it weff. We are making progress you know, no no plan ever survives first contact with the enemy and now we are the enemy for weff obviously and And and now that millions of people are waking up. It seems like by the week at this point You know weff is suddenly in for an actual real fight and so that's why I was just in Mexico Tracking migrants as I've been doing this is all part of a larger Jungle, let's say it's not just about farmers. It's not just about truckers It's not just about the information information war obviously is PhD level warfare All of the substrate for everything going on is information war as you know So who do you okay? So you said we are the enemy let's say and so who do you mean by we and What do you what do you think the fights about? How would you characterize it and who do you think so to speak is on the other side you mentioned the wef and of course They're they're enemies of the moment or what would you call it villains of the moment? And I think deservedly so in many ways so but how do you characterize this battle? why do you think of it as a battle and What does it look like from your perspective when you're talking to the truckers and the farmers and the and the law enforcement types Well actually it's it's Intergenerational as you know we could go back to the 1920s and talk about a Russian information war and even earlier 1879 grant was talking about it when he was in Paris and so But so so this isn't something that started last week or even last generation but some of our biggest opponents at this point are certainly wef and CCP of course I've written three books on CCP information war unfortunately that's the Chinese that's the Chinese Communist Party for those of you who aren't up on the acronyms and We'd be hard-pressed to find a more devious enemy than the Chinese Communist Party If you're a supporter of the CCP and its machinations then you're either woefully ignorant to degree That's almost incomprehensible or malevolent to the core or some appalling combination of both so and it's so strange to hear You talk about the CCP and the wef in the same breath because you wouldn't think at all that those would be natural allies given That the wef hypothetically is well on the side of the planet and the West and civilization and the CCP are nothing but tyrannical warmongering North Korean wannabes so They're not Jordan. I mean that's an important point. They're not necessarily on the same side But they're part of the same jungle. I mean these are two serious opponents You know, there's nobody that actually runs the jungle per se right And yeah, and and and one of the massive opponents obviously is is Chinese Communist Party and they are excellent They are masters at information war again. I've written three books on this that are only in Japanese language I wrote them in English, but I was asked to publish books by a Japanese publisher in Japan about this and so in which I did and In an attempt to wake up Japanese to the intense Information war that they are undergoing, you know, I got kicked out of Hong Kong in 2020 by the Obviously the Chinese Communist Party because I was covering the fighting there for seven months and getting my share of rubber bullets and tear gas Constantly those things do sting but they're not quite like bullets the the bottom line is is the Chinese Communist Party their information ground game is so intense for instance I went to Nanjing to look at the the Rape of Nanjing Museum this museum is I've studied museum warfare in numerous countries for instance Indonesia Malaysia long list and I'll often go to museums to look for hints of behind-the-scenes influence and you see in the in the The the Rape of Nanjing Museum in Nanjing China that thing must have cost 50 million dollars I don't know how much it cost but but to be directionally accurate Let's just assign a number 50 million dollars and you know what when when you show up there in the morning There's dozens of buses filled with school children and they go in their different color shirts for the different buses and the different flags You know so that and I was the only Foreigner there to my knowledge and you know when you're about halfway through the museum, you're like, wow That was the biggest museum. That's like the Louvre almost, you know It's not quite that big but but it was quite a large museum and but then you're only you realize you're only halfway through it Now as a as a mental health expert, you know that there's two components to hatred and those are anger and disgust That's like h2o if you can if you can combine anger and disgust You will get hatred every single time as you go through that I'm a writer so I study these things as well as you go through the Nanjing Museum It's all about hatred and disgust focus towards Japanese, right? And that's clear, you know If you want to know what a country's future plans are you watch their information ground game and the information ground game against Japan is a pure hatred You know, for instance, they ring the sirens several times a year in Nanjing, you know As if there's an air raid going on when you're you know I've spent quite a bit of time in China all over the place You know at nighttime if you're in the hotel room, you'll always see the movies here comes the drunken Japanese soldier again was uniformed He kills that you know that the Chinese parents and rapes the girl and he staggers out drunk You know, there's that movie and then not next comes the second movie that night same thing It's the same story every single night seven days I don't I don't suppose they show drunken cultural revolution students from the 1960s I killing people and and and destroying the into all the last vestiges of Chinese traditional culture No, sir Imagine on and you can see for instance in Okinawa now one of the things that I mean you've talked about these things before You know, I have an office in Thailand. They're trying to split Thailand into three different parts What I was I was out with the Maoist in Nepal for about a year One of the things that they did to help You know the Maoist eventually win if you want to call it winning is to get everybody to speak their own languages, right? Everybody to go with their own divide and conquer when I was recently in Morocco same thing You see a new Berber language written on the road signs, which is like a new made-up language I mean Berber is not not made-up language But the written component is and I see these things all over the place where you know divided it's been happening down in Colombia I was down in Colombia last year with a senator Maria Cabal and Maria said why are they trying to get all the indigenous people? To speak their own languages and to fight each other and to fight us and of course, you know, Colombia just fell as well Right. So this is the same thing that is doing in Panama. I've spent a lot of time in Panama recently and and and I'm watching that closely you see Panama is melting down right now and And you know it obviously there's a Panama Canal there That's of some significance to put it mildly also Panama is a major invasion route to the United States I've spent many months that I took two congressmen there last year into the Darien Gap One of the most dangerous jungles in the world. Actually, I can't believe they went out there But they they went deep into the Darien Gap and I showed them exactly this invasion that's coming through Asia and Africa and South America up through Colombia up through Panama and going straight to the United States, right? People from about 140 countries completely unvetted and it's growing it's becoming massive I was there when Mayorkas landed right in front of me as Blackhawk helicopters some months ago And Expanding our program there for this invasion route. So all of these things fit together Jordan as you know the How do you stop from becoming paranoid? And I mean you're behind the scenes looking at all these strange things this web of intrigue on multiple fronts How do you protect yourself against paranoia and conspiratorial thinking? And this is a very dead serious question because it's you know It's very hard not to take on the trappings of your surroundings and when you're constantly looking at Intrigue and malevolence behind the scenes. I can't see how that could help but color your entire worldview And so given that why do you think people should trust your perspective and believe and believe that what you're seeing is veridical and and not Like tilted by your own. What would you call it? preoccupations and situational peculiarities Well, that's an excellent question and I've asked myself that many times because self auditing is Essential in this line of work and I do think I've had a sort of self vaccination when I was younger on this particular topic because I Since I was a child. I was always into science any especially physics and I was just Basically, I was failing school because all I wanted to do was study physics and so and You can never waste a moment of your time studying mathematics and that sort of thing, right and so You know when you when you start off when you're nine or ten years old Basically enthralled by the sciences and you live in a fact you built a fact-based world around your your life You you you build self auditing into your thinking processes, right? You're always questioning whether am I is this just a perception of my right or wrong on this sort of thing? You know, so yeah, I mean obviously I'm always So part of its so part of its scientific rationality. Do you have people around you friends and family that also help keep you in check? Well, I've never really been highly conspiratorial to begin with. I mean for instance when I on the museum warfare You know, I I mean that was brought up to me by someone actually a military officer that former now that I work with closely And and he flew over to Thailand to brief me on it Maybe eight years ago or something and we briefed me on it quite a while And then we started flying around to different countries like Indonesia and Malaysia and looking at these museums I said wow, this is clearly cookie cutter museums It's clearly designed to cause hatred against Japanese and you know when we look at oh good lord I could go on for literally day. I've written three books about it So I'll have to self edit there but so I make it going forever, but there is clearly a larger organization around these music this museum warfare and it's definitely centered in China for instance when I was at at Penang there was a There was a the curator of the museum. I said wow, what a nice museum you've got here of course, it was all about hating Japanese and and and and and he said oh I just got back from I just got back from Beijing and he said I was invited there because They enjoyed my museum so much and I said, oh really do you have any photos and he pulls out this book under the desk? Actually, it's a large book I photographed the whole book and it's got photos of all the curators from all these different museums such as Holocaust Museum in Houston, Texas, right and it's got all the names in there I photographed everything checked out every name in the book, right? It's clear and it took a lot of research but we can clearly see this is part of a very sophisticated organism Information operation that is that's just part of it. Okay. Well, let's let's turn Let's turn to the WEF and let's turn to the global utopias and to what happened in Canada the Canadian truckers here they were pushing back against what they regarded as unwarranted government overreach and intrusion into their private lives on the cove in front fundamentally and I Was a supporter of the truckers right from day one I believe like you do that truckers and farmers and the men particularly the men and the women who work on those frontline occupations have a Pragmatic wisdom that the intellectual types often don't and I've also noted too that the intellectual socialist types Really like the working class in principle But they actually don't like the working class as such because they tend not to hold the same Utopian intellectual views that the globalists do and so we saw that in spades in Canada And I've seen my government take a turn for the worse on multiple dimensions in Canada That's jaw dropping in its continuity and depth and it's clearly the case that Canadians haven't woken up to that yet Although perhaps they're starting to and a huge part of that is this appalling and unconscionable media collusion and so Now we see something similar happening in Europe it particularly in the Netherlands and we should let everyone know and you have to listen to this This is so important You know the Netherlands is the world's second biggest exporter of agricultural products this little tiny Postage stamp of a country that was scraped out of the ocean has managed to put itself together so that can not only feed itself But so that it's a major agricultural supplier worldwide. It's a phenomenal accomplishment We should be so happy with the Dutch farmers that we can hardly stand ourself and instead the courts in particular Have mandated that the farmers be scuttled and the government their own government has basically come out right out and said well Because you guys pollute so much We have to crack down on you as well as reducing the speed limits of our cars which is an author appalling move and We we're we're sorry, but a lot of you are going to have to go out of business But you know that's to make an omelet a few eggs have to be broken and as the president of Greenpeace in the Netherlands Said recently well, we know we're not going to combat climate change the climate change emergency without Inconveniencing a few people and now there's what? 40,000 truckers in the Netherlands who are up in arms and I believe a hundred thousand people have protested in Spain And this is spreading into Germany and into the fishermen in the Netherlands as well who are also being pressured by these utopian types And so how do you tie that into what happened in Canada and the US and and what do you think's going on? Well, it's all part of it this larger world economic forum attacks on us of course and and by the way I lived in Europe for six years. They speak a Dutch is having Deutschland periodic event I lived here four years in Germany I lived two years in Poland and I've been all over Europe, right? But mostly not recently Mostly I've been in Asia recently in other places and so but yeah, it's clear that for instance when I was recently in Mexico following the migrants just streaming crop and May alone we had about 310,000 illegally crossed into the United States in one month and so 310,000 roughly 310,000 known Cross yeah, just in May, right and so And I'm not sure what that number is this last month I've tried I don't know the number yet, but but the bottom line is it's it's increasing at a Very high rate and this human osmotic pressure I call it hop human osmotic pressure the push and pull of migration is Greatly fueled by one information campaigns, which I've seen in Colombia for instance on CNN encouraging people to go north and And also obviously another thing that causes hop it is war famine Pandemic and also the economic negative pressure which would draw you into another place, right? So there's the positive pressure that pushes you out and the negative pressure that pushes you in pulls you in and this is really Dramatically expanding and you can see this all also in Europe as you know big They're being overwhelmed with hungry mouths actually as we go into a global famine Which I've been warning about okay, so okay, so let's talk about okay Let's talk about this global famine man because I see that coming in in the fall in a big way And so my sense is well partly because of the Ukraine conflict and the fact that we're wiping out a big chunk of the world's wheat Supply and further fertilizer supply that we're going to be putting about 150 million people under intense food pressure Really starting this fall. I think that's when it's going to kick in and my sense is well There's no way that can happen without mass migration pressure on Europe Maybe of a scale that makes the last migration crisis look like virtually nothing and so am I being paranoid about that? You seem to be thinking along the same lines, and you said you've seen this coming for about three years. I Think you're understating it actually so what's gonna happen in the fall I? Started warning in January of 2020 actually and I've warned every day since and it's and I'm at this point Warned about you know half a dozen time today, so Pan for let's talk about pan for war first pandemic famine war the triangle of death they always go together If you get a big war or a big Pandemic or a big famine you'll get the other two you get one get the other two It's three musketeers and all of these things any one of them creates the hot human osmotic pressure right so these things go together So when I saw this I was one of the very first alerting on the pandemic right now I was in January in mid to somewhere around January 19th, I think I started warning about Pandemic and in and so Immediately having studied war for so many years not just kinetic war and the shootouts and all that I did that for years Back when I was quite skinny and running around out in the wars and all that But there's also information war which the PhD level of warfare And then there's these other components that people must study if they're going to be a serious student of war which is migration Pandemic and famine they always go together Period yeah, okay, so let me ask you let me ask you a question about that so my sense was that on the pandemic front that because we disrupted the supply chains and We said we have by no means fixed that in the least there's a shortage you can't get a car in Canada you can't get a motorbike you can't get a Personal watercraft you can't get paper and cardboard for books. There's a there's a massive Backlog and lineup for everything. I know that one container ship in five is now snared at a port And so I know what happens when you put pressure on the supply chain The people who suffer for that the most are the people at the bottom of the economic hierarchy And so those are going to be people that are barely hanging on in developing countries, especially in North Africa That'll be my guess where this is gonna affect this is gonna have the biggest effects And so, you know if you show a 1% increase in unemployment you get a 5% increase in psychiatric Hospitalization and that's because there's a lot of people who are just barely making ends meet and then if you double the cost of Necessities like energy or let's say fertilizer or we could even put in food Then you're gonna produce a tremendous amount of economic pressure on these people Tilt them into starvation and so and we've seen what's happened in Sri Lanka, which is just an absolute bloody major significant ongoing catastrophe 21 million people in Sri Lanka There's no way we're gonna be able to feed them in any real sense for any long period of time. So all that eco Movement forward on the Sri Lankan front is going to ensure that those poor starving people are gonna eat every goddamn animal on that in That entire country to stave off starvation and then they're gonna burn everything for fuel because what the hell else are they gonna do? So this idea that we can make people poor hungry Cold or hot by scaling back food production and disrupting energy supplies and that's somehow gonna save the planet is as backwards of conception As any dimwit could possibly formulate and so okay. So what do you think is gonna happen in the fall? Massive famines and you know, I went to Sri Lanka Four or five six years ago to have a look-see I'm often just going and looking and checking the police and the food supply and there was plenty of food Sri Lanka had so much food. It was just like in cheap and plentiful right and then the next thing, you know, here we go Now that was doing well Yeah One thing about famine famine creates famine in the same way that war creates war and fire creates fire Famine creates famine. So when we go into these initial phases of famine, you'll see Immediately obviously price controls will start to be enforced. This happens every time It's happening right now in Panama in the last 48 hours right price Oh, yeah, a lot of violence now in Panama In fact just minutes before you and I came on I was talking with a friend in Panama about the current situation That's how close I keep tabs on Panama And for various reasons one is the Panama Canal and so and so and another thing is is for instance When when people are hungry that as you know within 48 hours they're gonna hit the streets right and they'll start robbing the stores They'll start robbing the the trucks and the trains and the boats and so then supplies stop going Governments always start taking food from the farmers. They without exception in my Study over the years Governments always go for the farmers and like in Egypt recently forcing the Egyptian farmers to sell to only approved You know Warehouses that sort of thing so people start robbing from the farmers as well, right and then the farmers say hey I'm not make I'm I'm either bankrupt or I'm not making any money. And so the farmers stop farming So that's how you see we get into the second season of this, right? And so the the famine creates more famine just like fire creates fire and then famine You know, let's say you have 20 million people that are hungry in Sri Lanka And as their nutritional, you know resources diminished so to does their Physical resilience and now they're open to disease Many of the people that die in famines actually die from things like they call them famine fevers One of those is typhus and others relapsing fevers Cholera, which is not a famine fever waterborne, of course people anyway the bottom line is Many of the people if not most who died during famines are actually from disease and then this causes that human osmotic pressure And these sorts of things often lead to more war, right? So it's a it's a recursive sort of you know, the the factors just keep you know, it's it's almost a Fission reaction right and it was yeah sure absolutely positive feedback loop. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah runaway Pareto distribution problem Runaway runaway catastrophe. Yeah, I get it positive feedback loops emerging everywhere And why do you think what are the factors that are driving the reemergence of the famine? You said there's a lot of instability in Central America. So we're gonna keep an eye out there Obviously Sri Lanka has collapsed entirely and there's absolutely no doubt whatsoever that a major part of the reason that Sri Lanka collapsed is because the globalist utopians get Gathered the reins of government in Sri Lanka because it was actually developing at quite a rate And as you said it would had a lot of food and not a bad general income level just a few years ago So this wasn't a catastrophic country to begin with it was a country on the move upward and it was completely scuttled by these globalist plans and so what's contributing to the developing famine right now in and where do you think it's going to be most intense? Where will it be the most intense? That's the something I think about every single day One of the things I've learned in wars and then the study of war is whatever you think will probably turn out to be wrong Yeah, yeah, you know this I watched so many of your programs this you know the This the systems that that emerge will will present themselves in due course, right? What we can see is the the you know when I talk with Laura Logan the famous Correspondent she'll say they've been talking about you know 1.2. They meaning World Economic Forum have been talking about 1.2 billion people Forced to migrate they've been talking about that for years, and it's true. Yeah, and they're gonna blame it They're bloody well gonna blame it on climate change you watch that's what we're gonna do You bet yeah It's a 1.2 billion 1.2 billion so my estimate Estimation of 150 million is you think is optimistic I think highly optimistic I would not be surprised Jordan I would not be surprised if within by 2025 if a billion people aren't dead I mean, we're really heading into the most epic Famines that have ever happened in human history I don't know look man. I was I was looking at a I was looking at a Economist cover the other day the economy economist magazine and it said 20 million people saved by kovat vaccine And I thought yeah you bastards for every mill for every million persons that you saved with the lockdowns and the whole vaccination skip not the vaccination scam, but the but the pandemic panic you're probably going to kill 50 because of supply this supplied chain disruptions and Postponed starvation and so you know that's part of the problem with turning political decisions over to the medical experts Is that what we save we save some people with the left hand and we doom a hundred more with the right hand And and and that and there there is a lag we try we basically tried to shut down the world's economy for two years As if we could do that because well look everything so plentiful isn't it doesn't it matter at all that people aren't going to go To work it turns out that it actually matters a lot And so what are the factors right now that are contributing to this emergent food? insecurity quote problem Why are why are these people who were being fed not being fed now? Let's talk about energy energy is another kill shot. Yeah, yeah This highly ill-advised war in Ukraine You know I was in Lithuania last year warning about this over and over and over I was down in Morocco With my friend war correspondent Chuck Holton, and we called up Frontex Which is like the European border patrol you might say there their headquarters in Warsaw And they said Belarus Lukashenko the dictator there is pushing migrants into Lithuania And I had been with the Lithuanian army in Afghanistan. I called them up I said what's going on and they said hey come on up So I flew from Morocco to Vilnius Lithuania, and I had full access to their elected officials Intelligence the camps for the migrants and Army the whole thing so for almost a month right so I was very well aware that Russia is up to something and I was publishing that right and so we've gone into this war on Ukraine right and Russia is just of course obviously a Nord Stream is cut right will it be turned back on and now as you probably are aware we just have I wouldn't turn it on if I was Putin I Wouldn't either and you know even Trump warned them about this years ago love him or hate him He was very clear about it And we just had an explosion roughly a month ago at a Texas port an LNG facility Which is critical right we were supplying liquid national natural gas to Europe This would have helped you need this for the Bosch the Haber Bosch Process to create the many of the fertilizers right that natural gas is very important Then we had an explosion and a pipeline explosion roughly two weeks ago in Texas and then we just had another natural gas Problem at a plant in oklahoma. We've had three oklahoma two in Texas right meanwhile. They're being shut off in from Russia and We've got a potential war brewing here for instance between Iran and Israel imagine where that could go on energy supplies We're looking okay, so let's let's look and let's look at that for a minute So I'm going to lay down a proposition here for all of you who are listening If you are a friend to the poor and the oppressed and the hungry the number one thing you want to do is drive energy prices as low as they possibly can be on every front that you possibly can manage and that bloody well includes coal and Petroleum and natural gas and then we could add nuclear to that And if you want to throw renewables in for the tiny percentage that they account for you could do that, too but because energy is equivalent to work and because work is equivalent to food and shelter if you make energy expensive what you do is you starve the poor and you don't have to starve them very much before they become Desperate and things fall apart and then we fall into these positive feedback loops that Michael has been describing and so when you hear these bloody Globals globalist utopians talk about the necessity for higher energy costs You remember that that car comes directly at the cost of the world's poor Christia Freeland the Deputy Prime Minister of Canada two weeks ago had the unmitigated and I would say quasi demonic gall to announce publicly that $8 a gallon gasoline in Canada was actually probably a good thing because Canadians should be reminded non-stop Just how severe the climate crisis is every time they fill up their cars and that's perfectly bloody fine Unless you're living on the edge of your economic capability and the fact that you can't afford to fill up your car anymore puts you into unemployment and food deprivation in relationship to your children and that's in the rich West and now in Europe We're so goddamn stupid on our energy policy because of these idiot environmental schemes that we've made ourselves Pathologically reliant on the Russians and we're gonna bloody well see what that costs us and I know the Germans are burning coal again Because they're there switch massively expensive and counterproductive switch to so-called renewals has been another Catastrophe and so now God only knows how expensive energy is going to be become and that's directly related to the provision of the famines That Michael is talking about so get ready for this folks because it's coming down the pipes Jordan Germans are collecting wood right now as much as they can get they realize this can be a very cold winter, right? Yeah, this is gonna be a very well. That's what I thought the globalist utopian mantra. Let the poor freeze in the dark That's how you save the planet. Yeah, no kidding man If anything that can destroy the the European Union, that'll be it if Germany collapses It's over right and you know Many of us have been looking at Greece and Italy and Portugal and Spain for years wondering which one would go first I thought it would probably be Greece, but we saw Italy looks like they might be the first to fall off the tree, right? And and and and probably the other three Italy Portugal Spain You know Greece or Italy already, you know Greece probably be soon to follow These are the weak canaries in this coal mine mean that'll fall out of the European Union Oh, yeah, and now look Putin has just cut the gas For the annual maintenance and and of course, I've got Zelensky over there Saying that you know Canada should not send back the turbine to Germany and like he's inserting himself Basically into the life and death of hundreds of millions of people Zelensky the actor, you know I mean, this is really we've never seen something like that. I mean I if things continue it's all about conditions People often talk about sparks, you know, what will be the sparks? Yeah. Yeah, no kidding man sparks sparks is an amateur question professionals talk about conditions There's always our parks and the conditions that are being set now with whether it be the inputs of fertilizer Fungicides pesticides all the other chemicals that go into agriculture the energy diesel LNG just so many factors that that are really going the wrong direction Transport, you know famines in the past have generally been recently I found in 1910 1911 Britannica And I looked up famine. I was just seeing what they you know I thought about famine back then and it was a very wisely written entry in Britannica and they said they and the entry posited that that you know large famines are probably a thing of the past because now we have modern transportation Obviously some of the largest famines were yet to come because the largest famines are always caused not by locusts and drought They're caused by people taking advantage of these things, right? Like the like the the Holodomor in and 1932 33 in Ukraine very good book on that called red famine Where six million people were starved to death by the communists and where where women were shot if they went out into the fields That had already been harvested to glean individual kernels of grain by hand to feed their children if they didn't turn over those individual kernels of grain then they were then they were summarily Executed and that was fun in the communist Soviet Union only six million Ukrainians and so and you're exactly right on the famine front as we like to think that the reason that people starve is because we don't Have enough food and at the moment the reason that people starve is because we're stupid and often malevolent and so okay, so Germany's in trouble and a huge part of this as far as I'm concerned is because of these unbelievably ill-advised energy policies that were hypothetically put in place to aid Aid the planet's movement towards lower climate transformation and Fair enough, you know, maybe we have some concern on that front but this this absurd panicking combined with post-hoc central planning and this insane notion that we can inset we can somehow make energy more expensive without producing Cascading sequences of catastrophes is naive beyond belief and malevolent the least in part so now Germany's in trouble because they're hyper reliant on the Russians and so now Back to the Dutch farmers now the the the Dutch Government put pressure on the farmers recently because a legislate a legislative body that was EU controlled that's my understanding decided in favor of an idiot environmental group that that that come and the court compelled the government that's a non-legislative body by the way the court compelled the government to act in relation to the farmers and Apparently the farmers have had enough of this and so what's happening in Holland and and elsewhere in Europe on the revolutionary front Let's say and and and what do you think their motives are and what effect has this had in Holland? Wow, this is a big topic as you know, yes farmers are Probably the finest and most efficient in the world right and Practically no Dutch people seem to know that which is extraordinary, right? And and and they don't realize how important their farmers are to the world with as the second largest food exporter in the world Yeah, it's well, it's a miracle right because the whole of how big is Holland? It's like it's a tiny country. You can drive across it like three hours Meanwhile Marco the prime minister is the teachers pet of Klaus Schwab I mean, he's even more favorited than Trudeau, right? Which is pretty hard to do and so that's right That's a hard contest to win on on the appalling front. Yeah, and so, you know the the the bureaucrats in Brussels They are ruling by decree, right? And of course, it has nothing to do with nitrogen here They're talking about nitrogen. It has nothing to do with nitrogen. It has nothing to do with ammonium. It has to do with Numerous things one is taking the land just as happened with Stalin You know labeling the farmers cool ox in Ukraine, you know, the Ukrainian farmers and attacking and killing them Here in Netherlands. There is a information campaign to make the farmers look like bad guys here as well I mean, these are the new yeah blocks, right? Well, meanwhile, let me tell you something about farmers I have spent more than half of my life overseas more than 80 countries a lot of war I'm always going out with farmers, right? I've never met farmers from any country. I can't get along with I mean Like even Taliban farmers had common sense at one point I'm in Afghanistan out with one guy. He's growing opium. He's growing poppy for opium and he said, you know He's showing me the bugs on his plant He said your helicopters dropped these bugs on our plants at night to kill our plants. I said no, sir We should be doing that because you're you're not going to kill our plants No, sir, we should be doing that because you're creating opium, but but we don't we're not that smart and he goes Yes, you're not that smart and then it's like let's go have tea and but anyway even at one point I'm out with the because the two years I spent in Afghanistan one year was with various militaries like British and American militaries and and Lithuanians and that sort of thing and another year was just alone running around out with farmers and whatnot And at one point, yeah, well the farmers farmers are so much they're like truckers in that regard They're so much in contact with the yeah, they're like on Yeah, yeah electricians and contractors and carpenters That's why Christ was a carpenter by the way, because if you're not honest, you can't build a house that stands up man And he wasn't a PhD Sociologist he was a carpenter and those people who have to have their hands in the dirt and their feet on the ground They have a sense about how the world works That's practical and embodied that the the pinheaded academic globalists lack entirely and are also often incredibly jealous of and so in Canada it was the farmers and the truckers who rose up You know the misogynists and the bigots and the racists in our prime minister's terms and then that's triggered these these co-occurring protests in in the US and in Holland and now it isn't easy to get farmers upset either a because those tractors that they bring to the protests those things are bloody Expensive and most of the farmers don't own them there they have to finance them And so they're running on very thin margins three to five percent a year generally and you have to be one canny person to run A big farm in a modern economy You have to be paying attention to all sorts of unbelievably complicated and sophisticated things And so when the farmers have been pushed to the point where they're willing to take time away from their farms to spray manure on The government steps. It's probably time to listen. So I agree with you on that front 100% So, okay, so you're in Holland and you're talking to the farmers and what are they telling you? But you basically are reading my mind which is very difficult to do So when I was just in Mexico And I saw the Dutch farmers I know a lot of people in Netherlands and so when I was getting inside, you know that they were acting up I was like what Dutch farmers are actually protest. No. Yeah, right, right, right man the last people you'd ever expected We yeah, so that's why I jumped on the airplane Because you know if the Dutch farmers are acting up I need to come over here and hear what they had to say That's for sure. So let's talk about that. It's it's first of all clearly The the web the WF they call it web here in Netherlands The world economic forum is trying to control food supply right that is production and distribution, right? and so in one of the ways to do this is as Stalin did within Mao did in China and Stalin did in Ukraine and Russia is to take the farms away from the traditional farmers and then Put your new your farmers on that land right to what end Michael like I read about you know You know the the notion that we need that we need to you know Turn to plant-based foods and insect-based protein in the future and that you know meat production and all the cow methane are contributing to the degradation of the environment, but like what What? Do you do you see this as a plan or just as a as a part of the globalist utopian? ideologically blind stupidity Because I mean there farmers do pollute there is runoff from from fertilizer It does cause algal blooms for example in the water and these are these are problems I don't think they're insurmountable problems, but you're pointing to something that's more malevolent and deeper and Dramatic and and you know we don't want to go there without without questioning that presumption I always think if you can explain it with stupidity you don't have to explain it with malevolence Well as you know that's a be careful with that one because sometimes we do have to go to malevolence I know I know we do yeah, and I and I watch your show enough to know you know exactly why this is happening And let's talk about this if the Dutch farmers Let's take this as a premise are the most efficient in the world. Let's just say they're the second most efficient Why would you knock them out of the saddle to get somebody else to produce the food where Indian farmers? I mean who's going to produce this food in a much less efficient way that would create even more pollution This is clearly about control also. There's something that you never hear and what and and and any press that That I've heard in the United States is the tri-state city Tri-state City is this smart city that they're proposing to build between the tri-states are Belgium Netherlands and Germany so this mega city basically That would take up all this farmland in that area and which would bring Huge amounts of more people into this area right so the tri-state city is something you don't hear much about But that's another part of this plan there was a fire about maybe ten days ago I went to it right after the the next morning, and it's it's at a picnic distribution center, which is those that there was a An investment six hundred million dollars into this picnic food distribution center from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Coincidentally and it burned down right and so you know that brought a little Raise some eyebrows. Why did that thing just burn down? There's many of them There's others in Netherlands are growing But the bottom line is is the bill and Melinda or Bill Gates is buying up farmland as you know all over the place He is the biggest private landowner in the United States right now and the land that he's buying up he's taking out of food production and It seems to me because he's obsessed about about meat production at least in part doesn't believe that that's part of a sustainable future And so but I I do share your your skepticism. It's the same thing happens on the bloody energy front It's like well, Australia won't build coal generating electrical plants But they'll ship their bloody coal to China where they're going to build much dirtier plants And the same thing applies to Canada if we shut down our industry energy industry, which are bloody insane Narcissistic delusional traitorous prime minister thinks happens to think is a good idea and seems to be working as hard as he can to manage All that's going to happen is that we're going to see the ground to people like Putin Who we also turned into a radical enemy with hers with his hands on the control pump for Europe I mean I don't see how we could be Stupider here in the West if we actually took courses in stupidity and tried as hard as we could It's it we seem to be doing everything we can to break everything as rapidly as possible And then I wonder too, you know, is it hasn't got to the point where the people who think You know that you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs and there's too many people on the planet think that this is some sort of Like needles I that we have to go through All this mass starvation and death so that we end up with a sustainable population, I mean Jesus Christ that's a dim and grim scenario, but I as you said, why would you take the Dutch farmers out of business when when they're so unbelievably hyper productive and efficient, it's just it's not like there's too much food Especially not if we don't have farmers if anything I would be trying to get a large agricultural institute here in Netherlands to teach other farmers how to be as efficient as Dutch farmers are replicate these farmers in Afghanistan Actually, many of the farmers coming over I was out in the farms quite a lot We're actually Dutch farmers to teach Afghans how to do things better But the bottom line is as you can see there is a huge I watch you all the time, you know What's happening? There's a huge authoritarian The Desire to have a one-world order is clearly strong and this isn't the first time it's happened as you know it's a constant and human behavior and and also as a Somebody who studies the human psyche a lot as you do you realize pulling these farmers off of their traditional farms? Unroots them it cuts their anchor their boat anchor. They're going to be drifting You know culturally so that makes them much easier to you can't control farmers Well, that's why yeah, I'm going to get rid of the farmers You know Stalin had to get rid of those farmers because farmers have a mind of their own same with Mao you got to get rid of those farmers because they think for themselves and Likewise here these Dutch farmers think for themselves. And so they're the bad guys to me. They're the great guys. These are yeah me too Man, that's our backbone. They are backbone. That's why I flew to Netherlands from Mexico I mean, that's how important this is. Okay. So what have you just what have you discovered on the ground there? You've been talking to farmers Tell us first of all tell us about how the protests were organized what their scope is and what the farmers why the farmers are doing This and what they hope to accomplish Well, the farmers actually the farmers in Netherlands are amazingly cognizant of what's happening Many people that I talk with around the world don't realize you know These other things like the weft, you know the WF and these sorts of things but the farmers are talking about it in detail They're like the nitrogen is nonsense, you know, and it's all about clash Wob and Bill Gates is trying to do this and they'll go into great detail. They know exactly what's happening They're trying to take our land because of this this not me other and you know, they they know it They're not just like in Panama. It's another story Panama is just like give us cheap gas Give us cheap cheese, you know keep you know cheap this and cheap that and we'll go home, right? They're easily satisfied not the Dutch farmers. They're more sophisticated. These are serious players here. And again, that's why I jumped on an airplane If people like this are blocking streets around Netherlands and we got the German farmers joining up with them and saw it They're blocking the border together German and Dutch farmers, right? Polish farmers, you know, I love Poland. I spent two years there Poland Polish farmers are making videos in support of Dutch farmers That's how much is look that started in Canada jumped over to United States it's over here now I mean, it's really growing this courage is is spreading and so and you see Italian farmers Spanish farmers People are rising up and the more they realize what's actually happening because you know The man behind the curtain is that is the WEF the World Economic Forum Of course, we're gonna have to deal with China But at this rate if Germany falls from these energy issues which is looking pretty likely at this point China is gonna peel off the rock too, right as are we economically right? So for sure. Yeah, we cannot sustain We cannot we cannot sustain the collapse of Germany. That's absolutely 100% obvious. That would be an utter bloody catastrophe if Germany collapses EU's gone right for a while, right and And I mean the EU will probably dissolve. That's my guess. I don't know We'll see when time unfolds but obviously that'll take our economies with it and China right and Japan and of course Japan imports what 60 70% all these island nations and island state like Hawaii that Import Hawaii 90% of their food imported right? Oh, yeah. Yeah, they are gonna be in for our world of hurt Japan imports most of its food and you know some of these countries that I have to You know, and I kind of I should say maybe insulted the French for a while years ago and saying why are they Defending all these small farmers all the time now. I see the French wisdom, you know Farmers yet that resilience and these smart when you go to France and you go to I'm sure you've been to France. Yeah And and their small farmers everywhere provide a great deal of resilience, right? And that's why in Netherlands if they if they lose these farmers are Vital for that they're as important as their army. I mean, you know without these farmers you're somebody else's You're in somebody else's pocket Bill Gates the World Economic Forum Yeah Well, and also if you lose if you lose the farmers for one generation you learn you lose all that knowledge You know and I saw the government said well some of these farmers are just gonna have to move It's like what are they gonna do? They're gonna move their farm. How are you gonna do that? You can't move a farm and it's not like these things are just what? Transferable fungible in this simplistic manner. And so yeah, this is just this is it's such a form of insanity And it's all justified by the fact that these half-wit Globalists are claiming constantly to be moral because they're saving the planet and you know, I know this literature I know the lit the planet saving literature Let's say because I studied it for about four years and in some depth and I think I found the world's thinkers who thought this through properly and that would be Matt Ridley and Bjorn Lomborg and Marion Toopey most particularly and all three of them and I would put Bjorn Lomborg at the top of that list those thinkers knew Something fundamental and something so bloody optimistic that I couldn't believe it was true when I first encountered it Which was that if we really want to reach a kind of sustainable harmony with the planet the best way to do that Absolutely, obviously is to distribute Autonomous free market systems as widely as possible and then to get people everywhere in the world as rich as we can as fast as we can Because the biggest contributor to environmental degradation isn't industrial It isn't industrial development. It isn't the efficiency of the Dutch farmers. It's Absolute bloody poverty and privation and the probability that people at the bottom of the economic distribution are going to fall into these catastrophic positive feedback loops that you described and Devastate and lay waste to everything as soon as you make people rich the data on this are crystal clear As soon as you get people up to about five thousand dollars a year in gross domestic product They start caring about the environment locally and autonomously And so, you know we're in a situation right now where if our leaders weren't so concerned with scoring cheap reputation points and being Hypermoral in their ignorance and and pretentious in their global ambitions we could be working towards a world where everybody had enough food and enough education and were simultaneously inspired on their own account to Do what engage in the kind of environmental stewardship that would leave a good planet for the children and their grandchildren? We could have our cake and eat it too you know and yet what we're doing is we're breaking the supply chains and dooming the poor and and Fostering what's going to be a mass migration into Europe and that's just going to be a bloody catastrophe and I hate to see this and and I hope I'm wrong and I'm just being paranoid but But I don't think so. I don't think you're being paranoid. You know, I again I spend most of my time downrange You know, I spend a lot of time in places like China India just good lord I mean, you know when you land in China, sometimes I wonder if my airplanes are gonna make it through the smog or we're gonna get Stuck like amber and the smog, you know, I mean, it's so thick. Sometimes you can't see the ground It's unbelievable and and likewise with India, right? I spent almost a year in India and another year in Nepal, right? It's just it in Thailand where I have an office sometimes you have to have air filters in every room and Because you know because all of Asia's not all of Asia but most of Asia's burning their farmland every year You can see it in satellite foot. Look it up. I mean, it's unbelievable So, I mean this pollution that comes from poverty is quite intense Not that China is poor and rich and in India obviously is is Increasingly wealthy, but they have huge amounts Of impoverished people and their factories still actually are behaving as if they're Still actually are behaving as if they're poor. They're dumping smog out, you know unfiltered. It's unbelievable And anyway, we could go on about that forever But the bottom line is the farmers are clearly under attack here in Netherlands The German farmers also were very efficient again. I lived here. Sorry four years in Germany and and That and their farmers are also under attack and so all across Europe How many people are engaging in these in these protests right now and are they raging as intensely now as they were a week or two weeks ago My sense is that they're actually growing They're not they're not say going like Panama was in Santiago last night in Panama Very violent and burning things and stealing police cars. They're not doing that here, but you can see it's a more intellectual At this point it's not gotten intensely emotional at this point yet Although I anticipate when if the energy doesn't get turned back on and and and yeah through the Nord Stream Things are gonna get emotional right all across Europe including here now most of the Dutch that I talked with I Was talking with a member of Parliament the other day. He was completely oblivious to the famines, right? Just Jesus Christ missed totally missing it, right? And so this this is kind of of concern and most of the Dutch people I speak with actually don't seem to see that Which is up good, but there's these stores are are nicely stocked in yes, Netherlands. It's a place of yeah It's milk and honey here, you know, yeah As you know, you're a student of history often Before the storm everything's quite nice and the wine is flowing and that's the way it is right now Yeah, and so I've read Western reports that it's about 40,000 Dutch farmers and so I don't know what percentage of the farmers that is and I don't know if those numbers are Anything approximating accurate and I don't know if you also are aware No doubt you are of what's happening in Spain where I understand there's been about a hundred thousand people protesting and so What's the scale of this in Holland and it's growing into the the fishermen are also coming out in support of the truckers as far As I've been able to tell and if you want a job that's even more difficult than being a farmer Maybe being a fisherman would be the more difficult job. And so What sort of scale what sort of scale are these protests? Manifesting at the moment in Europe and how many countries do you think are involved? You said Poland Germany Spain the Netherlands? Scale and and spread Italy Italy as well I I'm kind of reticent to make that guess yet And I've actually okay about this many times over the years whether I was in the fighting in Thailand or the fighting in in Hong Kong and which I've spent many years in these sorts of things and I'm often you'll reticent to To assign numbers now the media might say 40,000 or whatnot. I know it's a lot Let's put it that way and I and I do sense that it's growing. It's not gripped the nation yet. It's not Reached that level at all You see that the Dutch flag is often being flown inverted now instead of red white and blue It's blue white and red and now that the Dutch government about within the last week or so said that they're gonna start No taking those off of the overpasses because they present some sort of danger. Oh, yeah Yeah, yeah, the dangerous people will take a photo and put it on You know their social media right and then it'll spread and one town I think two days ago said that they're you know, they're not going to do it They're just gonna let him fly right? So I mean it so the symbols are growing. I'll meet well Are the duck cake? Well, we want it We want to focus on something here too for the enlightenment of the listeners and viewers. So I don't know if there's a more intelligently and Compassionately and justly civilized country in the world than the Netherlands So let's think about that country in first of all, it shouldn't even exist the Dutch had to literally drain the oceans and build walls just to make the country exist and Believe me man, you bloody well better be organized in order to do that And they did that hundreds of years ago and put together this unbelievable system of irrigation and drainage that ran on those amazing windmills which are technological marvels and and Dutch society is unbelievably civil and Peaceful and productive and interesting and culturally vibrant. It's a great country It's a it's a stellar miracle as Ion Hersey Ali pointed out when she moved there from from Somalia and so so we what don't want to underestimate the central significance of Holland and then Obviously of the Netherlands obviously that country is predicated to some degree for its success on the provision of stable food supplies and these Unbelievably efficient farmers and so the fact that they are up in arms about all this is of signal symbolic and practical importance, which is why I think it's so Necessary to focus on their concerns and also so appalling that this isn't headline news in every every legacy media outlet across the across the West because when the Dutch farmers are upset and Moving en masse the way they are Something has gone seriously wrong. This is a canary in the coal mine situation It really is and you know as you mentioned the sophistication of these of these people in general I mean basically the Netherlands the sophistication of building this country out of nothing I mean, it's basically flat pyramids. I call this just think of the pyramids flat I mean, this is very difficult country to build and yet they did it back without modern machines they did it just their brains and their brawn and they did it and persistence and Organization these are extraordinary. They're not normal. They're like Japanese, right? They're like Yeah, yeah, or so right and yeah, right while they're even taller, right? They're like how I think the Dutch are the tallest people in the world And so I always feel like a shrimp when I go there and and metaphysically as well because it is such a remarkable country They are tall. I mean they're bouncing their head off the moon. It seems like it's a So But I mean extraordinary people and and and thus came these extraordinary farmers, right and so and Thus they are an important target to take out For people like wet when you're talking about information more and when you're talking also the food supplies I mean, this is just like what every every company every You know invading army or whatever always has a budget right there's only so much energy you have and it's the same with wef the Wef and so you need to concentrate your efforts to get things going in places like Russia and Ukraine and to get things going in Panama if they're behind that and also Netherlands, so, you know pick your targets, you know, you're gonna pick Vital critical nodes and Netherlands is a critical node There's a lot of bang for the buck here by taking these farmers offline And there's and culturally as well because you know once Netherlands is unmoored remember this this this is Meant to be the hub of tri-state city. Don't forget tri-state city I mean this is and what what is that tri-state city? What's what's the idea there? tri-state city is meant to be a mega smart city between the tri-states would be Germany Belgium and Netherlands where those borders come together this mega city that many Dutch have actually not heard of and and they will take this farmers land and make this mega city there and bring people from all over the world and This is to what end to what to what end to what end what's what's the rationale for that? Central plan central plan. Okay. Okay. So, okay So what are the farmers? What are the farmers hoping to accomplish like in Canada part of the reason that the truckers convoy Ended I would say and I would say it ended pretty successfully in many many ways First of all, they had the sense to end it before it degenerated into anything even vaguely approximating violence Which was extremely wise and conservative on their part and careful and compassionate The opposite of all the things they were being accused of and but part of the problem with the truckers protest It wasn't exactly obvious what the end goal was, you know And so they were accused of fomenting rebellion and of wanting to produce a January 6th insurrection which was basically what the bloody Trudeau liberals accused them of and tried to convince Canadians of and which the Americans even Democrats think is an utterly preposterous notion and which was factually untrue to the nth degree So but they didn't exactly know what they wanted They wanted the damn government to leave them alone Fundamentally and stop mucking about with the energy economy and stop intervening in their life that made having a livelihood Impossible, but it wasn't more concrete than that, you know end of vaccine mandates That was part of it in the mask mandates but and so but what is it that the Dutch truckers want apart from not being like eviscerated and chased off their land Well, you know that I would say that the Canadian truckers protest didn't end It took on a life of its own. It's spread. I mean, it's fantastic. Yeah, fair enough men spread in America and here now, right? And so yeah, yeah, and what did the Dutch farmers want? Mostly they want to be left alone. They want to be farmers You know, they right I was out of the they want to go back to work They're farmers. I mean, they're busy. Yeah, I mean they're busy people. They're they're all those things at once they just want to be left alone they want to be farmers they have their own culture and And they just want to do what farmers do which is farm right and make money and graze their families and Live life right and feed other people which is really nice of them all things considered Right, and I think everybody watching this probably has somebody in their family who's a farmer, right? I mean, you know, it's just I mean pretty much all of us are in some way tied to farmers if not directly Very close indirectly and and the farmers again We can't understate this the farmers are a backbone of this culture and when it comes to information wars whether that be Mao unmooring Chinese or the Russians doing this, you know creating the Soviet Union You want to cut people from their boat anchors cut them from their cultural anchors? And then you can then they're very easy targets for many things for instance for instance Genocide for one and and another is Menticide right Rape of the Mind Which is a great book which was written in Netherlands right Rape of the Mind 1956 one of the best books on Brainwashing I've ever read Written right here, you know because this has happened many times in the past It's going to continue to happen in the future and one of the most important Vaccines that we can take is to study cult making and Menticides and how these techniques are used against people I've studied these things for years because when I was in special forces people talked about if you want to fight communism You have to study cults because communism is a cult, right? It's got cult like components that are very important, you know, so I studied cults for years I infiltrated a cult at one point actually it was a cannibal that I tracked down oddly enough and infiltrated them That's an interesting topic. Oh my god. Yes, it was epic But I mean but the point is is cults are cults and the only cults people won't see is the cult that they're in Right people will never see and that would include me if I'm in a cult I'm probably not gonna see it right but everybody else can see it Hey that guy's in a cult, right? And so, you know the cult making of wef the W EF we can see clearly they've got this climate cult, right? Yeah, everybody's like oh we've got to do this You know, we're willing to kill people in mass to do it even though we have no idea about this Okay, so so let's talk about let's talk about that again, you know, the reason I like Bjorn Lombard Because there are some concerns on the environmental front like there always are we've overfished the oceans to a terrible degree And it would be better if we polluted as the least possible and there is some evidence that human Contributions to global warming are a genuine thing But I looked at the data as broadly as I possibly could on that front and I concluded that Lombard's group in Copenhagen Had the most intelligent approach to assessing the problem and offering solutions and basically what Lombard did was take the IPCC climate report and accept its Prognostications on the global warming front as accurate now that doesn't necessarily mean he believes that or that they are accurate But he was willing to start there and then he calculated with teams of economists and I don't know how else that how the hell else you do it what the detrimental consequences for global GDP would be as a consequence of the proposed climate change and then he Projected out what our wealth increase would be by the end of 2100 at 3% or 4% a year growth Which is about what we've averaged for the last 30 or 40 years and he calculated how less rich we would be as a consequence So we much richer than we are now Barring all the catastrophes that are man-made that we've been discussing But will be slightly less rich than we would have been if there wouldn't be climate change and then Climate change and then Lombard lays out a number of things that we can do to ameliorate the consequences of climate change But he do go goes farther than that. He said look Climate change is not actually the only problem that we face There's a whole plethora of global problems, which is part of the reason there's like 200 UN sustainable development goals and it isn't obvious that we should be dumping trillions of dollars into climate change Amelioration when we have other problems to solve as well So he had ten teams of economists rank order the world's problems as Outlined in no small part by the UN and say look if we were going to donate resources If we're going to devote resources to the amelioration of these serious problems What are the most serious problems and where can we get the most bang for our buck and then he averaged across economists? Approximations of what the cost-benefit would be in addressing these issues And what he found was that most of the issues having to do with climate change amelioration don't even meet the top 20 they're not even included in the top 20 for the things that we should be concentrating on most and I read me Lombard's work and I thought well I've never seen anyone do a more careful analysis of the entire situation than this Does anybody have a counterargument and the counterargument seems to be if you're not a true believer in the apocalyptic climate Nightmare and if you don't think that no Measures no matter how dramatic are not even sufficient Then you're basically an agent of Satan and I just don't regard that as a careful and nuanced argument I think it's appalling and it's a reflection of the ignorance and Luciferian pretensions of the globalist utopians and their absolute inability of them of themselves to educate to become educated on this front and so Well, sorry for the rant but Jesus, you know, this is serious business and now they're going Well, now they're trying to shut down the bloody farmers. It's like what the hell's going on here We actually need food especially poor poor starving people. Remember them Socialists aren't those the people that you're supposed to be on the side of well all you're doing with your idiot utopian globalism and your environmental apocalypse and Your willingness to identify yourself as part of the moral elite because you care about the planet is dooming Well, Michael thinks a billion people to starvation So what the hell how is that moral? Well, you know the climate problem is so serious that if we have to starve a few people to solve it It's like fair enough man. Let's say you're right Well, you're not because as soon as you make people poor you make the environment worse Period the end not just a little bit worse way worse Radically worse just wait till you see what happens to Sri Lanka on the on the sustainable biological front so Okay back to the Dutch farmers. So what's gonna happen in Holland and what's gonna happen in Europe? You said it's dependent on whether the bloody Russians keep the taps off What's gonna happen? I think about that approximately once an hour because What's gonna happen? This is you know, this system is emerging the energy is the LNG is now cut off So a lot of these things that are important right now might seem unimportant Just one month from now if that energy is not turned back on again Because this is gonna cause an immediate cascade right and yeah this summer will be over yesterday You know, it was so hot here some places closed. It was only like 99 degrees Of course, I just came in from Mexico. So I'm good to go I'm from Florida, right? so I mean and so they actually were closing some places here because it was too hot and In some public transportation and it's made me think you know, this is actually kind of a minor challenge This winter is gonna be cold This is a very serious deal as you know Energy is it is a kill shot for food, right? I mean if there's not enough energy They're not gonna be able to create the fertilizer and transport the fertilizers are unique We already saw a large fertilizer plant closed down in Norway and others as well. That's just one of others Well in you and Ukraine and Russia are major sources of fertilizer production Yes, and China has just stopped their exports as well and and many other Jesus this is a this is a cascade and we're already it's almost like a Kessler-Sindum cascade here, right? I mean, it's just and at this point I think there's too much inertia to stop it at this point There was I think we could have headed it off even a year ago if we suddenly had serious leadership Across and and we directly addressed W EF if we had a president and a no what we have What we have is leadership who meet and then laugh about Putin's shirtless photos. That's what we have instead of serious leadership Yeah, we have we have a pack of many issues The inertia is too heavy at this point We're gonna we're going to see a lot of starvation and a lot of hop human osmotic pressure the migration Yeah, and of course this leads to pandemic will have real pandemics because again when you have many people starving there First of all, they start migrating and eating things They don't normally eat and their immune systems are depressed Anyway, bottom line is every time you get big famines you get big pandemics which will create more war We get that positive feedback loop. Well good then we can lock everybody then we can lock everybody down again Hey, that'd be real fun We can lock everybody down again like they did in Shanghai and then we can disrupt the supply chains And even more and then we can starve a bunch more people and maybe we will settle out with 600 million people and have a sustainable planet, you know with all those 600 million people living in the ashes and the skeletons and with Bearness and apocalyptic nightmare everywhere around them. That'll be a hell of an outcome It's interesting because you know, some people say hey, that's apocalyptic Apocalyptic and doom and gloom and I say if you've looked at my work over the many years You'll see I'm actually very measured. I wouldn't say something like this because I I know that my Many people depend on me to get things right So I research seven days a week travel the world talking with the right people Reading so many books you wouldn't believe and and I try to figure out what's going on which is difficult And but I do have a good track record and I can see how the conditions are setting It's not about sparks. We see Panama for instance going in the wrong direction at this point And that's obviously vital Panama canal. We see, you know issues between Iran and Israel which could cause other energy issues Nord Stream is cut. We've had the explosions in Texas and and in Oklahoma Energy's got in even if Nord Stream were wide open Europe's got problem with energy this winter. That's just a fact of life, which means next year remember famine creates famine next year We're not gonna have enough fertilizer period. We're eating the food that's already been grown at this point. So right now So and we in addition to this normally we have a lot more resilience for instance Yeah routes that we have in the United States. Okay, we have terrible We do have incredibly terrible droughts right now in the United States Normally we could kind of fill in the gaps and it's not gonna be happy days, but we'll fill it out Nobody's gonna starve to death But now our resilience is reduced And so what you know, we're not gonna be able to be sending food out to all over Africa and these sorts of places Without starving our own people now keep in mind by the way during famines often countries like China We're exporting huge amounts of food while their own people are starving now was doing that actually Stalin did that when? Ukraine was starving it that's a strange thing about famine some countries continue to export food while their people starve But that's a side topic. Well, that is what you do when you're aiming at starvation Yeah, well, so you're a lot of fun to talk to Jesus. You're though. You're there. I don't know Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're that's an even more dismal conversation than the one I would have with myself I would say well look Michael Thank you very much for talking to me today and enlightening me and all of the people who are watching and listening about these preposterous and appalling Occurrences I sure hope you're diluted and wrong, but I'm afraid you're probably not And that's really sad and horrifying and we're gonna be lucky if we get through this winter without major bloody Catastrophe as far as I can tell on about five different fronts and these absolute abdication of leadership in the West especially on the Environmental front is right at the forefront of all of this and so alright for everyone who's listening I'm gonna continue to talk to Michael Behind the scenes so to speak at dailywire plus I've added that to my YouTube offering or my online social media offering let's say as part of this daily wire deal I have been talking to all my guests for an additional half an hour or so about the development of their career Michael's had an amazing life I would say in in about five different dimensions and I I would like to ask him how his interests unfolded and what pathway he followed and what his calling is to use a Anachronistic biblical term and that's all offered at dailywire plus who have been kind enough to produce and film and edit and Help distribute and publicize all of this work That's also part of the dailywire plus deal which I think is a good thing for everyone including me and hopefully the audience And so we're gonna switch over to the dailywire plus and if you want to support the work They're doing which is at least in part trying to bring actual journalism back into the world so that people know that Famine is coming for example Please give some consideration to offering them some support, you know We're hoping to make the dailywire plus into a Reliable alternative news source, which means an actual news source in today's world and You know, I don't know if we can manage it, but that is our aim. So Michael Thank you very much for talking to me today. That was extremely interesting in the most horrible possible way and Kudos on your adventurous spirit man and your courage in the face of all this God you have a ridiculous life It must be quite something to be trying to address these concerns Conceptually and in the practical way that you're doing it traveling and so forth and by by keeping your ear to the ground It's an amazing thing that you're doing and so hopefully Hopefully it's gonna tilt us away from the four horsemen of the apocalypse because they certainly seem to be on the march again And that's pretty bloody sad to say the least so over now and everybody and Michael as I said, man Thanks very much for agreeing to talk to me today. Thank you, Jordan. It was been a pleasure and an honor. Thank you very much, sir I would encourage you to continue listening to my conversation with my guests on dailywire plus com
