 It's not just that the Israelites are supposed to go. It's not just about freedom, which some people sometimes want to weaponize Exodus to talk about freedom. It is about freedom, but it's not just freedom. It's freedom from the tyrant in order to serve a higher purpose. Leaving the Pharaoh, going to the wilderness to worship God. That is what they're asking the Pharaoh. And in some ways, that is why it is so dangerous for the Pharaoh. Because the Pharaoh wants the Israelites to just be a tool of his power, reduced to potential for his means. And if they now go out and worship the God of the Hebrews, it is dangerous for him because it will consolidate them as a people and it will become something like a challenge to his authority over them. And it's interesting because he says, I do not know God, right? It's like, I'm not connected to your God. I don't care about that. I will be your God. He doesn't say that, but you know, it's like, I am your God. You do what I say. I don't want you to worship something else beside me.
