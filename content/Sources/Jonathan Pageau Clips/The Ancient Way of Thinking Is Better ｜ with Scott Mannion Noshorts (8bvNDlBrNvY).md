 It's funny because, you know, people have been attacking me and in some ways attacking John for defending me, which, you know, I always thank John, I thank John for defending me. But they attack me and they think that I'm trying to, like I'm tricking, like I'm trying to trick people and trying to like infiltrate ancient thinking into modern, the modern world. And like there's this trickery thing and I'm like, no dude, there's no trick. I think the ancients understood the world better than you. I really do believe that. And that's the reality I'm trying to bridge. I'm trying to get you into their, their way of thinking, not the other way around, right? I'm not trying to camouflage ancient thinking and trying to adapt it to the modern world. Like I know I really do think that the saints and the ancients had a better understanding of what motivates humans and how these agencies function and how they manifest themselves on others.
