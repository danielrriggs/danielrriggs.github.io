 And these images are all there, like all these songs, that is beautiful imagery to help us understand how the story of the flood relates to you. Like you said, this is a key for our own experience. Like how the story of Moses through the desert, the Israelites being slaves in Israel and being forgotten by God, and then God remembering them. And I think that's what that means. It's like it's just giving us a key and showing us that even in scripture, it tells us that the other stories that use those images are about your experience. Right, the way they kind of interweave and overlap. And then like Psalms is sort of like the cherry on top. It's sort of like, okay, nice, you've heard Jonah do it. And you've heard Hezekiah do it. And you know, you've heard Noah do it. Now it's your turn, right? So it sort of puts us in the sequence in a way so that we make this prayer as well.
