 You definitely can guess a family's culture if you watch them decorate a Christmas tree, both in terms of how they interact while they're doing it, and then ultimately the final result at what it would look like. Will it look like something that no one cares about? Will it look like something that is straight out of a magazine so perfect that it almost doesn't feel like it should be in a home? And then all the way in between that, and so your Christmas tree can really be an image of your family and your family's capacity to work together and to also participate in the celebration of Christmas. And celebration happens that way as well. There's something about celebration which is both a looking up towards the same goal, the same purpose, the thing which unites us, but also the capacity to express some idiosyncrasy together as we're celebrating. And so it really is something like a dance.
