 Alright, so Josh Anderson says, Hi Jonathan, what do you think is the power behind a movie or modern story with a meta reality? For instance Wizard of Oz where Dorothy wakes up to reality with her relatives playing major parts in the meta reality The Matrix when you wakes up from the meta reality Or finally Truman Show where everyone else is in on a reality You're not allowed to be part of because you're the subject of a meta reality I feel as if our culture has a fascination with these types of plot devices And I'm wondering on a symbolic level what do you think drives the popularity and admiration? These movies often stir things so If I don't think all of these are the same So I'm not sure the Truman Show is the same thing as the Matrix let's say in terms of of that notion But yeah, yeah, yeah, so I mean I think that the you could say that what these types of stories do is that they are talking about the intuition we have That there's something missing Like there's something missing in the world and so it's like what is that there's that that that the sense that The sense that this world is not enough and so that's I mean you could say that that's really where The religious all the religious impulse comes from and kind of condenses into And so that's but it's not just about this representing these layers of reality Let's say like in the matrix, but it's it's every quests story every story where you're you every MacGuffin story, right? Every story where people are fighting over something that they need something that they're missing And if they could just have that thing that everything would be okay So it's like that's just this weird human condition we have which is ultimately this desire for the infinite like it's ultimately The strength position we're in As intelligent beings You know to have this upward movement to have this movement towards Towards more And so I think that's what it's about But the funniest the funniest part of this the the funniest are the simulation people like the people who Who say that the world is a simulation and like I just find that so hilarious because What is it the simulation of and so it's like I completely agree And so it's like I completely agree that the world in a way Is is a layers of simulation, but it's not in not in a bad sense But you could say it's a layered world of realities that are stacked on each other And so that's a traditional way of understanding it And so you and so let's say the lower rungs of the world are heavier and have more Layers on them and as you kind of remove the layers you have access to more Reality and more light you could say And it also helps you understand or helps you see the reason for the lower ones not in it's like so it's not like a gnostic sense where you're just Where you're where you're where the body is bad or anything But it's mostly that it's like as you move up you kind of see the reason for the lower things Um, but it's but the way that people phrase it. It's so superficial. It's like it's so It's so superficial Ah So I kind of joke and say like the world is a simulation It's called language. It's just language is the simulation in the sense that it's the condensation or or even concepts or even Any form any any particular? Making particular ends up being what you would call the simulation Right because it's pointing to something which transcends it, but it's also it's manifesting it in a in a Approximate way you could say and so that's that feeling like that feeling we have that there's something more You
