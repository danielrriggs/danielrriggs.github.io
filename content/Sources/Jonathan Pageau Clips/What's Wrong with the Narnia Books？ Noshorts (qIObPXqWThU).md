 So Golden Pigeon of Valor says, once you said that the symbolism in the Narnia series doesn't work, why do you think so? Oh, I didn't, I'm not saying the symbolism in the Narnia books doesn't work. I'm saying that it's not as powerful as it could be. CS Lewis, unlike Tolkien, for example, doesn't take into account the quality of the beings that he places in his Narnia. And so, for example, like a satyr has a certain characteristic. It's a human with animal legs. You know, centaurs are usually related to aggressive, out of control sexual desire. And so to have them just be like characters in the book, like, okay, here's the centaur, here's the faun, here's all these creatures, and they don't have the qualities of what they are. So there are wonderful things in the Narnia book, but I think that he kind of missed that. Whereas in Lord of the Rings, like the orcs look like what they are. And so all the different groups have like characteristics about what they're manifesting exteriorly. And I think that that's closer to what you find in mythology.
