 You meet all these kinds of people who even if they can believe in God, they have this idea, okay, I believe in God, but I believe God is more like an abstract force, is more like something that's an idea. But that is just not our experience of reality. Because we view the world through our own consciousness, our own human consciousness. We don't know of any other world besides the one that we can view through this human consciousness. The highest thing we encounter is always other people. The thing that can transform us the most, that can make us, like you said, more human are always other people. And so I always find it strange when people think that the highest aspect, let's say the highest ontological aspect, that the image of the infinite would be something that's abstract. Like no, the image of the infinite has to be connected to our experience of the world, which is a personal experience, which is an experience that is through consciousness. So, I think that's the biggest thing. I think that's the biggest thing. I think that's the biggest thing. I think that's the biggest thing. I think that's the biggest thing. I think that's the biggest thing. I think that's the biggest thing. I think that's the biggest thing. I think that's the biggest thing. I think that's the biggest thing. I think that's the biggest thing. I think that's the biggest thing. I think that's the biggest thing. I think that's the biggest thing. I think that's the biggest thing. I think that's the biggest thing. I think that's the biggest thing. I think that's the biggest thing. I think that's the biggest thing. I think that's the biggest thing. I think that's the biggest thing. I think that's the biggest thing.
