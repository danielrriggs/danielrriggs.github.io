 You have to stop doing all the bad things that we do, but we also have to do it in a way that won't make you crack and make you just, because that's the thing, like, I forget who wrote it. There's an analysis of kind of American Protestant morality, which is like binge regret, binge regret, and it's like this movement between these two extremes where you're meant, in some ways, like, although you're saved, you're kind of meant to be perfect. I remember growing up as a Baptist, I remember hearing my pastor in church saying something like, Christians don't practice sin. And I'm like, what? It's like, well, Christians sin once in a while, but they don't practice sin. And I was like, I was like looking around to the people and I'm like, this doesn't sound right. Like, I knew that there was no way that this was possible. And so what it is, it sends you in the spiral of guilt, right? Especially if you take the words of Christ seriously.
