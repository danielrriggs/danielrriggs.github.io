 So he says in order then to go back into this space, we have to remove the coverings. And the coverings have to do with our passions, they have to do with our sins. And you have to think about it because it's not arbitrary. Why do we sin? We often sin because we think that that's where life is, right? We think that we have a desire to eat and those desires are not wrong. None of our desires are wrong. We have a desire for sexual desire, we have all these different desires. But the problem is when we enter into that, we think that that is going to be our protection. That if I eat, then I'm fine, right? If I give in to this desire, then I will find life there, that I will be safe. But that's why we have ascetic practices because that's not where true safety is, that's not where true life is. So St. Gregory of Nyssa talks about this removal of the garments of skin.
