 So, how do you explain the difference of Christian theosis versus the noose versus other spiritual practices of opening the third eye? And so, I think it's not, I think that they're not completely different from each other, at least in terms of, it doesn't express itself exactly in the same way, but you'll find in the Philokalia, in the text, the mystical text of the Eastern Church, you'll find the idea, it doesn't express itself as a third eye, like in the forehead, but it expresses itself as the eye of the heart. So, it's not exactly the same, but it's similar in the sense that it's the idea of like a central heart, right? A heart in the middle, which joins the two visions together. And so, that's what I think the third eye is often referred to. It has to do with reaching an insight, which joins opposites together in unity. And so, you could have a fractal experience of that, where it's like you have these, you have two things and you're able to kind of see how they connect. Symbolism is something that is part of that. And so, you have a little mini experience of insight, and that insight appears as the place where opposites join and become one. And I think that that's what the fathers mean when they talk about the eye of the heart, which is also this like central heart. But in a certain manner, in terms of Christianity, it's not just a mental exercise, right? It's not just a... I mean, although I'm not suggesting that... It's not just about knowledge in the most immediate sense. It really is also about concentration and embodiment. And so, maybe that's the difference, but it's definitely not... It's not completely unrelated.
