 The body is not is neutral. The body is almost like the earth in the creation sense. It doesn't have value. There's nothing wrong or good about body. Sin is not related to body. It's the in-between part which is problematic. The in-between part is what will... When you fall into the body, it's not because of the body. It's the desiring capacity, it's the in-between capacity which is focused in the wrong direction. Instead of looking up, which would order the body, it looks down and then the body... It'll idolize the body or idolize the bodily function or fear for the bodily functions or whatever. That's one of the things that ends up bringing about sin. That's important to understand. We're so Gnostic. It's so hard to break the Gnostic thinking. We always tend to think spirit, good, body, bad. It's so ingrained into us. Christianity is really not about that. The problem happens in this desiring capacity. If you're attentive to yourself, you'll notice that all sin is born in thought and desire. It's not born in the body. The body will express yearnings, let's say. The sinning all happens up at the middle part. Depending on how you direct your attention and where you direct your will, that's where the problem arises. Which goes back to take every thought captive.
