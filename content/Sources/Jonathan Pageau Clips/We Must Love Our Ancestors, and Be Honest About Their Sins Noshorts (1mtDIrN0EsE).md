 There's got to be a way, and I know you've done videos about this, but I'll just say there's got to be a way to both love your ancestors and also be honest about their sins. Yeah. There's got to be a way to do that, and right now it seems like we can only do one or the other. That's actually a function of idolatry. It's an image of idolatry, because one of the things that happens is that because we don't have the fractal relationship, because we don't have this hierarchy that leads all the way up to God, we actually expect of these lower rungs to be perfect. If they're not perfect, we hate them because they're not perfect. And so there's a sense in which if things were properly laid out and we don't treat these figures as idols to worship them or to cast them down, either way, we see them as just manifestations that are gray because they're not God. All these leaders, all these heroes have dark sides. Obviously, there's no way around that. Right, yeah. And we could celebrate their heroism and also recognize their sins.
