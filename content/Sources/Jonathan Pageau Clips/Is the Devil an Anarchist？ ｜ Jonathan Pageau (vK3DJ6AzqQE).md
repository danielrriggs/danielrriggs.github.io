 So Eddie T asks, hello Jonathan, I've got a question about the nature of the devil's motive for rebelling against God. Is the devil a usurper who aspires to take God's place on the heavenly throne or is he more like a modern-day anarchist who seeks to abolish hierarchies altogether? No, for sure. Well, first of all, anarchists are not anarchists. They're never really anarchists. Especially violent anarchists, they're little tyrants. They say anarchy, but what they really mean is if, kind of like how Jordan Peterson phrased it, if I was in charge, if I will destroy this, but if my ideas, if my vision was in charge, then everything would go smoothly. And so the Satan is prideful. He believes that it stops at him. He believes that he's equal to God. And that's the origin of all sins and it's the origin of all evil, which is to think that reality stops at you, to think you contain everything. And that's when you discount your relationship to the infinite and you want to contain everything. Then that's when things start to break apart. And that's the nature of rebellion.
