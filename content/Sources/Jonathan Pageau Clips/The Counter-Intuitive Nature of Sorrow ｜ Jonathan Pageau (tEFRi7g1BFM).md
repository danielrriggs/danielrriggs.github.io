 There's a term that people use in the Orthodox tradition, which is joyful sorrow. And there's an idea that in some sense, you can reach a state, and you have these saints that have the gift of tears, they call it, where the saints cry all the time. And this gift of tears is in a way, a kind of infinite compassion, where you actually cry as you see the suffering, but that also, that compassion also becomes the source of like an unbounded joy or an unbounded peacefulness. And so I think that we do need to mourn for that, which for people who die, we need to mourn for the difficult things, and we need to cry with those who cry. But in doing that, it's also how the good comes out of it. Compassion is also the manner in which good manifests itself in tragedy. And so it's the very way that it happens. One of the ways that God uses to bring good out of bad is through compassion.
