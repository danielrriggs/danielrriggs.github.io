 The witch sees in her mirror that the most beautiful of all is Snow White. The witch visits her three times. The first time she brings her a corset, the second time she brings her a comb, and then the third time it's an apple. She tries to bring her supplements to her beauty. Why is she doing that? She is already the most beautiful girl in the world. Why is she trying to convince her to take on these added things that will make her more beautiful? That's when I started to see the relationship between the story of Genesis, this idea of the garments of skin, of adding something on top. Then it clicked with me that the apple has to do with knowledge of beauty. She's trying to make Snow White self-conscious. She's trying to make her self-aware of her beauty. Because until then, she's beautiful but innocent. She doesn't know she's beautiful. That's probably one of the reasons why she's most beautiful.
