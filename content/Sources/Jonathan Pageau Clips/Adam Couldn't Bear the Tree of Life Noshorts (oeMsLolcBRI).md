 And it's weird because then you see in Scripture where he talks about the lamb that was sacrificed before the foundation of the world. And so the cross is actually revealing something. Like it's not just an answer to sin. It's revealing a very deep mystery which is actually very origin of creation itself. Timothy Petitza has a wonderful image in his book. You know, he's kind of, he's speculating obviously, but his speculation is quite powerful. He says he has this image where when Adam took the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil and he was able to see the tree of life, right? So it's like it worked, right? It's like if you take the tree of the knowledge of good and evil then you have access to the tree of life. Then when he came to the tree of life he saw the cross and he saw Christ on the cross and he couldn't handle it. Right? It was way too much. It's like that's not what he thought he would see there. And that's one of the reasons why he freaked out and covered himself and ran away basically because it was just too much.
