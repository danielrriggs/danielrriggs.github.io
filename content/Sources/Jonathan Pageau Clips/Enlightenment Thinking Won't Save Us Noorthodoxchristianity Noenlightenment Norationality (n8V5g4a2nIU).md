 I think we're looking at two different problems. The problem of quantifying and predicting phenomena is very different from understanding the very frame by which we look at reality. That is the frame of hierarchies by which we organize the world. Two things are very different. You could say it's the difference between a hierarchy of virtues, a hierarchy of values, a hierarchy of importance, and the drilling down of the identities that are identified once that hierarchy is set up. It's like I decide what's most important and then I apply the tools of reason or of scientific methodology. I can apply them to certain phenomena that I identify and then I can analyze them. And so we can't measure both with the same scope. If we try, then we fail.
