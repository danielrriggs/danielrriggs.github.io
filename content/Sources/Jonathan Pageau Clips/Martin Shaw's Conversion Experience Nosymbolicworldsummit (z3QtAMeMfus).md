 What I never would have expected is what happened to me two years ago, probably quite a few of you know this story. I went on a vigil for 101 days in an English forest. It was 101 days because I wanted to make absolutely sure I'd gone off the idea by the time it was done. If you go for seven days or eight, you know, there's an emotional pitch to it that gets you through, but not for 101. And at the end, in the middle of the night, I had an encounter with something so utterly derailing in its beauty. I'm living in the shock of that event now. I am going through, you remember, you remember when Christ comes into the temple, you remember what he does. I feel like I'm going through a kind of spiritual audit in front of you at this moment hasn't stopped. So my life had to change. I don't know why it was that God did this to my eyes for the first 50 years of my life and then went now. Now.
