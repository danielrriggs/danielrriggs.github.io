 You have a template. It's partially intuitive and partially based on your learning. I think that there's both going on. I don't know to what extent you're aware which is which, but you're obviously very well studied, but you're also, you have an artistic sentiment. I think that you're storytelling in the moment, making sense out of any given set of phenomena, be it a TV show from Disney to a racy music video. You can just apply this thing. I'm referring to something you released yesterday. Yeah, just a recent video, the Montero. Very well done, very well done. So it seems like you have a template for a temple that can organize everything else underneath. So the idea, the way that I see it is that the patterns itself are like the things that I'm pointing to are not visible. They can't really be totally contained. And so it's just that they inform reality. And so the way to, the way you can only intuit them, but you can't totally describe them. So the idea is to help, one of the ways that I try to do it is to surprise people with examples that they didn't think were, like you said, like I'll find an example from the Bible and then from some stupid music video. And then the fact that I can show you that those two things are talking about the same reality kind of gives you like an intuition of something above it, which is manifesting in these two different things. And so that's kind of, so it's not like, so you could say that the temple, for example, is definitely an image, a cosmic image of everything, but there are many images like that. Like there are many versions of that kind of cosmic image, but the image of a temple is definitely like a microcosm in terms of how it has, it accounts for kind of all reality, even the breakdown of reality. One of the problems with a lot of the systems is that they don't account for the breakdown of the system, whereas kind of traditional symbolism actually accounts for the place where systems break down. So the idea of a hierarchy of being means that you also understand that on the edge of that, there are freaks, there are exceptions, there are all these things on the edge. And so it actually, and you can actually help people understand that. Like you can help people understand what the role of the freak is or what the role of the strange is in kind of a meta system, let's say. Whereas when we tend to think of the system, we tend to think of things that are totally contained and that all of it is named, but in the symbolic vision, there's also room for the unnamed and the unnameable, let's say, or the things that escape identification. Yeah. But you do have like one symbol to rule them all. You do keep on pointing to Christ. Yeah. You say it explicitly. Yeah, the incarnation is definitely a, how can I say this? It definitely brings in everything into itself. And it does in a way that's very difficult to describe. Even the story itself, it's hard to contain it in your mind when you try to, because Christ contains sometimes these like wild opposites in the same story. And it can kind of, when you look at the story, it kind of can go by you and you don't realize it, but then when you start to attend to it, you realize what's going on in this. So wait.
