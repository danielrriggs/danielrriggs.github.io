 The first thing you might say is, well, if you can steal, then no one gets to have anything. Right, I mean, if I can just take what's yours at will, first of all, you're not gonna work to get it, and so you won't get it, because it usually takes work to get something. It's like- Well, so we're gonna fight, then we're just gonna fight. And then we're gonna fight, yeah, and then we're back to the killing problem. That's right, exactly. So, and I think this is why there has to be some tolerance for inequality as well. It's like, well, if you get to have things, then you also get to have some things I don't have. And I also think that allowing people to have things that you don't have is a precondition for, it's a precondition for wealth. And freedom. I'll be honest with you, I've lived in places where that is not the case, and the effects are astounding. I mean, the effects are crazy, because nobody trusts, nobody trusts anybody. Anybody, exactly. And then the cost of any transaction approaches the infinite. Exactly, and so then normal business becomes nearly impossible. Trust becomes impossible, and you can see, it's just, it is everybody against everybody. Yes, yes.
