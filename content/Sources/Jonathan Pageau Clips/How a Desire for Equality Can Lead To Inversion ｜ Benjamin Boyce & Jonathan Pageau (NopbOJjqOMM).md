 So we've spoken about the feminine before and and we've spoken about revolution before we've we spoke about the inversion and the You know clown world stuff before but maybe there is one of the ambitions of my literary work is to take all the genres of literature and Allow males and females to have discourse throughout all the different genres or the masculine the feminine and I see that there's a lot of work to do to Give Females story and and to put females in in story that doesn't mean Masculinizing them but making them present throughout all these different genres So is there not some sort of work to do to? give more Female stories give more representation of the feminine and in the rush to do that That's the problem that we're seeing is that people aren't really Honoring the feminine they're just trying to represent the feminine within the mold that already works being the adventure story being with what Disney does with that one Southern Pacific Islander movie, I can't remember Mona or something like that So I think that if I think the problem that it's inserting itself in a whole other few other things happening at the same time So it's not just that this is happening and like I said, it's that there's it there's a sense in which The fetish fit I can never say it's where it fetish eyes that is fetish ization of The the stranger is part of it, too Right the idea that we love things that aren't us more than us the idea that it's like it's okay Everybody wants to be a Buddhist everybody wants to be go to India Everybody wants to to do all the things that aren't your own story Except for your own story. So it's okay to be anything except for what you are. So that's actually that's actually a Can I say this that's a bigger trope and the idea of the switch between genders is just one aspect of this larger situation and it has to do it really has to do with the problem of kind of reaching the edge of a world like reaching the end of something where all of a sudden that so you saw that like for example the Romans in the second during the What is it the third century crisis or whatever? they had that problem where all the young people were dressing as barbarians and They they were trying to imitate their own enemies their own Because they were it's as if their culture was like running out or as if they were so They took it so much for granted maybe that then then they were just looking towards the outside and And so it's all it's all part of that. And so it also has to do so it's not just that it also has to do with like sexuality, which is that the idea that We want all types of sexuality except for the one that produces children is also part of that It's like all types of sexuality are okay The only one that's suspicious is the one that produces children and so it actually it's it's just this constant it's it's a general pattern of basically running out of steam and then Coming into the coming into something which would be the upside down coming into the the edge of an identity Which is its opposite? So that's what it seems like we're so the the mask and feminine thing is just one part of it But all it's all happening together and at the same time there was this election Last week or something like that and the results didn't favor a certain group and they took to the Twitter to Shake their fists and what they ended up doing was two things and I kind of joked about it because it was really interesting They're saying Critical race theory doesn't exist and is not in schools and everything is white women's fault, which is a critical race theory So they're practicing critical race theory saying it doesn't exist which is really interesting while they're doing it and then blaming the white women everybody's blaming the white women and You see that I'm reading the white shift by Barry Kaufman or mr. Kaufman. I can't remember his first name And he gets a lot of flack on that because he's just talking about ethno nationalism and and how America has Kind of passed the baton through all these different stages of who's a native and who's an immigrant and who's and it's always changing And what is white what is not white and how do we make a harmonious his whole arguments about making a harmonious? State with all these different cultures all these different ethnical groups which kind of break down But because he's arguing on behalf of harmony He is trying to say that white people have a reason and a will and and a definite evolutionary desire to propagate and and to conserve their culture and that's seen by Generally progressives as him being for an ethno state though. The white is demonized Just as the in in the past against the white was Angelicized or put upon a pedestal now and there's got to be some sort of Harmony within all these different groups where we don't want to have an ethno state we want harmony across all these different nationalities and The maybe the idea of the stranger is getting in the way of that and inverting that is the wrong solution to that Yeah, I Mean, I agree that inverting it is the wrong solution The the difficulty is that Things always exist in in they just always exist in hierarchies, you know, and so the The problem of the race problem is is too messy. It's it's also it's it's it's like I hate the race I I just don't like that That characteristic like I don't like using that as a frame But because it blinds people can't see straight they can become all emotional and it just becomes like a weird thing But let's think about it in terms of language, for example So in America, there's a hierarchy of languages There's you know, the English is the first language then Spanish is the second language and then there's maybe other people that speak other languages and And that just happens that way and so there's nobody for example Trying to stop you from speaking your language Which is something which has happened in the past and we can recognize that as a you know as for example in Canada We had a desire to eliminate Native native people here by Stopping them by assimilating them completely into culture. And so it wasn't so much about race. It was about culture It was like let's just get them to stop speaking the language will remove them from their family We'll train train them up as nice Canadians and that way the problem will go away because they'll all be Assimilated into that culture. Well that that that does that doesn't necessarily work either because you end up creating residues and remainders that are completely That become How can I say this to become bitter towards the system with reason and therefore then you have a you have someone inside who has Every reason to not like you but is inside inside the system but like in it but in a normal hierarchy where it's like It's just normal that there's a majority or there's a certain aspect of of a culture which is more Has more authority and then it just lays itself out from there. So It's the same so you can think about that that's how even let's say the Roman Empire probably Kind of laid itself out in that way where it's like, okay where the Roman Empire is there, you know You still have your own gods and all your things but walk a will have our temple. But you know, we There's a normal hierarchy which sets itself up. It's it's messy. It's not it obviously sometimes there'll be violence and it's not a It's not a perfect system But trying to make everything the same doesn't work because it's not possible So the only way to try to make something the same is to make it upside down and that's always what happens because you have to over emphasize the weaker parts of the hierarchy and by doing that you inevitably have to Demonize the the the authority or demonize the center demonize the thing which is giving the identity And so you end up with an upside-down hierarchy as soon as you try to do that so equality like the desire for equality leads to inversion
