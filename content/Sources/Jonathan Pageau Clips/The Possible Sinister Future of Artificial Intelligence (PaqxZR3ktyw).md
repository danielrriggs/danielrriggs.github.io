 It's interesting with these AI beings that, you know, get really, really close to crossing the uncanny valley, but never quite get there is I think the notion that that kind of an entity is always going to be a puppet, right? It's never going to have true life. So there's always going to be people who are able to kind of intuitively sense that something is off. I think you get kind of the same thing, honestly, with like super produced music, there's a feeling that it gives you that you can detect. And so I suspect that the realer that these puppets become, you'll always be able to detect that something is off. I'm going to say something that's going to, what if that oddity, they deify that oddity. That's where you that's it. Because that's the experience of the sacred is something which is not totally, which is pulling you into something else. And so you could use this weird uncanny sense to create kind of perversion of the sacred.
