 You have to understand the way the ancients thought. Creation was six days, and then there was the day of rest. The years of Noah were 600 years, and then there was the flood. And the whole world lasts 6000 years, and then it's the end of the world. So you have to understand it that way. That is, the six is related to the notion of man. The sixth day of creation. That's the key to understanding 666, is to understand it as related to the sixth day of creation. The symbolism of six has to do with a kind of fullness of creation. The fullness of the six days. The complete cycle is seven days, but that completeness includes rest. Seven represents completeness. Six represents a kind of perfection of work. The sixth is the days of work. That is why the symbolism of six, and the symbolism of 666, is not a dark symbolism. It's actually a symbolism of light. There are reasons why, for example, the devil is represented as an angel of light, is because it is the pride of light. It is the pride of work. It is the pride of accomplishment of creation.
