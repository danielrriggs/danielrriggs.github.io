 Thank you both. Random question. What's your favorite Orthodox book of all time? I guess outside of the Bible. Everybody knows like my favorite books are because I because I'm constantly quoting them. So for sure the life of Moses by St. Gregory of Nyssa is like that's definitely I love that book. You know, I reread it over and over and then the hymns on Paradise by St. Ephraim of the Syrian that little book that you showed that's a wonderful little book because St. Maximus sometimes is hard to read and St. Vlad's really did a great job at pulling in, you know, the aspects of St. Maximus that are more like kind of the lens which we can look at the world and kind of a cosmic image. I love that book as well. So I would say those are those are my favorite.
