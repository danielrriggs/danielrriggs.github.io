 All right, so Kenan Wang asks, I've heard you talk about the function of Christ in the hierarchy. What do you see as the function of the Holy Spirit? Well, I mean, first of all, yeah, so Christ, let's not go into that. Okay, so the Holy Spirit is, so you can understand in the role of manifestation, we could say, the Holy Spirit is that which kind of, fills or, you can imagine it as the breath that is under the word. And so it has to do with this kind of filling and opening and it can also be represented as fire, as this kind of spreading out of the presence of God into something. And so it has to do with this. So the Holy Spirit, especially in the story of Pentecost, you can see how the Holy Spirit is kind of coming down and going all the way to the end, right? So manifesting the different languages with the tongue of fire, right? So this idea of speaking fire, so that it splits into all these different aspects. And so that's why I also like that, so that the spirit comes down upon the waters, comes down upon man, God blows his spirit into the dust and then it kind of saturates the dust and brings it together. That's the best way that at least I can understand that.
