 Rod Reyer recently published an article regarding the coronavirus calling the situation the China apocalypse If you still have the energy would love to hear your thoughts and the symbolism of the coronavirus situation in China. Um, I Haven't read Rod's article, but It's a serious what's happening now is going to exacerbate a lot of the the problems that we have because viruses are all about they're all about identity and Infection they're all about borders. They're all about letting something in from the outside which can kill you and so What you're going to see and you can see it. Look you saw it right away when the coronavirus exploded in In in China, what was the first thing I got like in Canada? The first thing the first thing our government said was Don't be racist against Chinese and I was like, I mean I wasn't surprised because there's an analogy Between the virus and the foreigner, you know It's just weird that they right away jumped on that and they were like the thing you need to learn about The corona virus is you shouldn't be right racist against Chinese and I thought it's it's a dangerous game to play to push that because that Once the virus you've identified you you've made it about that you've framed the question yourself You know by saying don't don't be racist against Chinese because of the corona virus you've you've created a frame but there are two there are two sides to that frame and when the corona virus if it does become a multi It does become a pandemic Then the same Things gonna flip and now it's going to become the other side. So it's some scary stuff but for sure What we're gonna see is we're going to see breakdown. We're gonna see how How infection breaks down social structure, right? So how chaos from below these little bugs How they can come up and they can start to eat at the world and the world starts to fall apart It starts to break the bonds between in your body. It's killing your body But it's also destroying the social fabric as it break down breaks and breaking down the bonds And and it does so by now you see this pendulum swing where it's like Here's the virus. Here's the virus eating at the bonds of reality and in order to respond to that we We create we isolate things and so we we shut doors we've put people in quarantine and that but that also in terms of the analogy between the social level and the personal level then that Will exacerbate the problem because as you isolate people which you have to do You're you're continuing by you're continuing this breakdown of the social fabric by creating these these closed boxes in in society And as it if it gets worse then we're gonna see a lot more of that and it does in fact seem that Doesn't fact seem like if The moment will the moment we see a totalitarian regime arrive it could be it could be something after a could be after a pandemic because Enough chaos is going to call you are gonna are gonna beg the government to come in and you know Bring the bring the sword down So we might see that in China we might see the Chinese really cramped down on On their people might not just in China. We might see it happen in Europe We might see it happen wherever it is that that this outbreak spreads Yeah You
