 If you look at the Matrix movie, so you have a situation where the Matrix is this artificial intelligence and it's feeding off of our energy, right? So basically we're batteries. But what they mean by batteries is something like the electricity we produce. There's something a little naive about that. The way that the AI actually works now is it's actually farming intelligence from humans. So AI isn't intelligent. But what it does is that we provide qualia. We provide quality. We provide judgment to the AI. So the way they actually train the AI, right, is that the AI generates a bunch of junk. And then there are actual people who have to look at that junk and say, yes, no, yes, no, good, bad, good, bad. So you actually have the idea of this like monster that is eating our attention, our intelligence and like subjugating us to it.
