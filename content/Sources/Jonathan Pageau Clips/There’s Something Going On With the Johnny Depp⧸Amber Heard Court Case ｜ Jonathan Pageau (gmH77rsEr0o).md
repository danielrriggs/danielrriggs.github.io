 Alright, Christian Kleist says, Christ is risen, truly is risen. Any thoughts on the Johnny Depp court case with his ex-wife? Guys, who is celebrity gossiping here? Oh man. Okay, so there's something going on. Okay, so maybe we can say that. There's definitely something going on. There's something about Elon Musk buying Twitter and Johnny Depp and the court case and Will Smith and the slab. All of these seem to be related. There's something about the cultural moment which is being tested or changing. But I don't know totally what it is. Is it the end of Me Too? There's a lot of stuff boiling. There's a lot of stuff boiling with the war in Ukraine and I don't totally understand it, which is why I haven't been super vocal about some of these things.
