 I think that the enlightenment has played itself out and the side effects of the enlightenment have become more and more apparent. When you start anything, the purpose of the thing that you're looking at is strongest at the beginning. And as it plays out, then the side effects of that thing you're embarked in start to become more and more apparent. And that is how things end usually, because you start something and then at some point, things you hadn't thought about, things you hadn't completely considered in your story are starting to appear out of the very premise of the original story. And that is, I think, what is happening to us is that the enlightenment played itself out and it showed itself to be insufficient. And it showed itself to be insufficient in very powerful ways, which is that the religious crashed back into our world. And the new atheists actually participated in that without totally knowing. It's funny to watch how not all the new atheists, but several of the new atheists have completely embraced woke culture and have taken up the very religious image that is willing to twist reality towards purposes, twist reality towards identity, twist reality towards sacred things that you can't touch that are taboo. That has just really played itself out. So the world is being re-enchanted. It's like, we're not doing it. It's just happening.
