 So Matthew asks, what's up Jonathan? Any thoughts on the new chat GPT AI and its evident political bias? Yeah, I think that this is what in some ways I've been saying all along. The problem with AI, it's going to probably be more and more what it describes in the book of Revelation, which is that it's like there's a beast making it speak. It's not just speaking on its own, right? There's a secret intention behind it. There's a secret thing in it. And so this is, I think what's going to happen is that the new AI is going to be politically biased just like Google is politically biased, just like Facebook and all the current social media algorithms are biased. And so then what? Then you're gonna have this massively powerful politically skewed tool that people who on the side of which it is politically skewed won't see that, will just see it as an objective thing. And so it's definitely going into a dark place.
