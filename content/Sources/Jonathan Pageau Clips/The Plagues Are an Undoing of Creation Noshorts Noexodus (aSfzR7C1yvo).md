 What you'll see now in the plagues is you're going to see something like this, something like death coming from below and getting higher and higher. And so it starts with just the water, which is turned into blood, and now from the water come these frogs. And then later you'll see from the dust comes the lice and then the livestock, and then it's going to continue. The undoing of creation, you can understand it that way. That is, creation is this union of heaven and earth, and now there's going to be an undoing, where at first you're going to see the revolution of the earth from below, and then you're going to see a kind of oppression and hostility in aerial phenomena. Even during the flood, we tend to think of the flood just as the water, but that's not what's going on. There's the water and the heavens, and it's the separation of the two which undoes the world. So we think of the flood just as the water, but you can think of the image of just water and just heaven and nothing alive in between.
