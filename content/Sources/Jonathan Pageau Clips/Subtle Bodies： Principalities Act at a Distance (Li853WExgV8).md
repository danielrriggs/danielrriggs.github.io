 The idea of action at a distance through a subtle body is something that you do every single day and it is quite normal. All you need to do to experience it is to, I don't know, ask your child to bring you a glass of water and then watch the child bring you a glass of water. That is a subtle body. That is action at a distance through meaning making, through intelligence, and not through physically taking your child to the water and then having them bring the water to you. You are using your subtle body to affect reality. That's why many of the Church Fathers will talk about the notion that angels have what we call subtle bodies. Like a mind energizes a body, they energize bodies to move according to the role that they play, according to the intelligence that they participate in.
