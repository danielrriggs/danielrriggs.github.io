 Alright, so Phil asks, is there a parallel between the first Sunday of Advent's this year November 29th reading of Mark 13 33 to 37 where Jesus swore to the disciples, beware keep alert for you do not know when the time will come and Santa Claus coming at night discreetly. Staying awake might mean Santa will pass your house without stopping, of course, but the idea that someone might come by when you're being inattentive or asleep is interesting. Yes, I think there's definitely a relationship, it's not a direct relationship, but there's definitely a parallel relationship. One of the things that Santa coming down the chimney during the night when you're sleeping has to do with, it has to do with the Incarnation quite a bit, you know, in the sense that that's what happened, you know, that so Christ comes down, I mean obviously that's not what happened, but if you look at the icon, for example, you can see it's like there's a star and then down from that star in the cave is the Christ child which appears hidden, you know, to most and you know, and so is this hidden gift which is there in the in the cave that is at the bottom of the chimney, right, in the in the darkest place where the animals are and in the soot you could say, and so the the the manger is like this is the bottom of the chimney, right, it's the darkest place and so that's where Santa comes down and then manifests himself in the darkest place. So in the middle of the night, but also in the middle of winter, not in the middle of the winter, but at the solstice, right, at the lowest day, at the lowest moment when the Sun is the lowest, and so this is what's going on in the story of Santa and coming down the chimney.
