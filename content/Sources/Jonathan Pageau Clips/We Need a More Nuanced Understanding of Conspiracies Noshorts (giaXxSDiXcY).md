 In some ways, what is above them can remain opaque. And all they need is an incentive to do the thing at the level that they are. So think about a soldier digging trenches during a war. That soldier does not need to know what the general's strategy for winning a certain fight is. You know, he has to be vaguely aware that they want to win the war. He has to have like at least some direction. But he doesn't need to know all the plans coming down all the way to him. You know, he just needs his commander to tell him to dig the trenches. And he just needs enough trust and enough incentive at his level to do that. This year, we saw the advent of the progress pride flag. And so all of a sudden, everywhere in the world, the pride flag got switched to this new progress flag. That is called a conspiracy. That is a network of people that have all agreed to do something in unison. It doesn't have to be a totally top-down thing. Sometimes it can just be everybody knows where to look. And when something changes in that direction, then everybody aligns themselves with that change without receiving some like explicit orders from the top down.
