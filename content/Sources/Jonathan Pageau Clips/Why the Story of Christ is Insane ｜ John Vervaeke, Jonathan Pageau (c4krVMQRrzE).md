 If you actually look at the story of Jesus, it's an insane story. Because even if you know traditional storytelling, it's like you don't have stories where someone is like a warrior, and a king, and a shepherd, and a worker, and a monk, and it's like all these categories jammed into this one story. Like this doesn't make sense, but that's the point. Grab all these story structures, these aspects of the gods. It's interesting because a lot of the people that have tried to criticize Christianity will say, Jesus is just a copy on all these old gods. And it's like, yeah, you mean all of them? Like every single one of them? Like he's all these weird things that would never for a pagan be brought together. And so it's like, that's it. So it's like you look at the image of that person on the throne, and it's like it's that, that condensation. And then that person, he is the source, but he also ends up being the judge. Because he's the standard by which all the multiple aspects get compared to. The through line.
