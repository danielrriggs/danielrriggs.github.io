 And one of the problems with the spiritual but not religious is that the spiritual but not religious person says, I don't want this spiritual pattern to bind me to others. I just want it to be my own individual thing. It's like, I want the absolute transcendent non-being of nirvana, and I just want it to be me. I don't want it to bind me to others. I just want it to be me. And so if we stand together, if we sing together, if we process together, if we bow together, if we do the things that we do together, then the spiritual is not just binding me as an individual, but it's binding me to my family and my family to a larger communion, etc. etc. And so that's religion. I don't know what to tell you. If dogma is necessary for a relationship with the transcendent, how then do we avoid the dark side of dogma? I mean, saints, I don't know what to tell you.
