 So the idea then of the fire of Gehenna or the river of fire that comes from the throne of God, that's more complicated because to some extent there's an idea that that fire is God or is the presence of God and it's the presence of God which is burning. If you let yourself be transformed, you know, if you let go of your animosity, if you let go of your resentment, if you let go and you turn yourself towards love, then the fire that comes from the throne of God will be a deifying fire. That fire will consume you in a positive way, will consume you, you know, like the love between two lovers, like that type of consuming. But if you refuse to be changed, then that fire is acting like coals on your head. It's burning you. It's burning you because you don't want to be transparent to reality. You don't want to be transparent to God, to the infinite. You want to hold on to your thing, to your pride, to your whatever. And so then here comes this fire that is absolute and is there to open up everything and to show everything and you don't want to. So that's going to burn you. It's going to hurt. That seems to be the vision of hell which the Orthodox are adopting mostly.
