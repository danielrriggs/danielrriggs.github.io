 The way the demons, let's say, affect you is usually through a... it's like a passion. You've got these desires and there's a pattern of behavior that is above it. And then when those connect together, that's when you have these repetitive behaviors that enslave you. When you know you don't want to do something, but then you find yourself doing it anyways, then you understand that you're in another personality. There's something else ruling over you, manipulating you through your desire. You have to see them from far away. It's hard to deal with them when you're in the thrall, so that you stop them further out on the gate. Like, for example, if you're taking drugs, then when you've gotten whatever you're going to get from your friends or from your dealer or whatever, and you've got it in your hand and on the table, it's like too late. You had to be able to see it from the moment when you started to think about it, and from the moment you started to have the desire, from the moment when you started to make excuses for yourself, way before it gets to you, let's say, way before the claws are in your back.
