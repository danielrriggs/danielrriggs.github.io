 Yeah, and then and then the the shape of of man Let's say at the beginning of Genesis when God creates heaven and earth it says God God created heaven and earth that the earth was chaos and void and the spirit of God Was above the waters. So you have this idea of spirit and spirit is wind or breath. It's all the same Yes, that that's also important to say. Yeah when it says the word spirit. It means wind it also means breath Because breath is wind right? There's no difference Like what you said in the last video, it's not a metaphor breath is wind breath is actually wind and so and the only difference Which is important. Oh, that's another example of a word that that we have to sort of redefine The word spirit breath soul all those words they refer to the breath. It means breath and it right away if you understand that you can see the relationship with heaven and In the story it says God formed Adam from the dust of the earth Yeah, and blew into his nostrils the breath of life. So right there you can see that It's all about joining heaven and earth. Yeah, so the breath comes from heaven and the he raises some earth and Then that's man. Yeah, and that's From that union and it's exactly when you talk about the mediator Then it shows exactly that that man is the mediator because in the beginning these two things are completely separate you have You have a heaven and spirit and breath and wind above and then you have this chaotic Formless earth at the bottom and those two things don't let's say they don't touch each other there They're they're they're separate and then then there's the creation of the different the different strats at the strats of Of creation the heavens and then the grass and then it comes closer and closer and closer until you reach the human being and then the human being has the heaven enter into the earth and joins with the earth so that Quite, you know explicitly in the story man is that is a microcosm of heaven and earth But also the mediator because he joins them together He's not just a representation of that separation But actually a representation of that union and then within man There's another microcosm which is the separation of man and woman which represents again heaven and earth Which are separated, you know man being heaven and woman being earth, but then you and united at the same time So like and then that keeps you know It's like these microcosm keep and bet keep embedding themselves into each other To create this fractal structure that we're talking about the Bible is just full of those those fractal like structures. Oh Yeah, I just wanted to say something about also Again the concept of breath maybe just talk a little bit about that Because it's it's also important to understand the connection if you want to think in that way where The breath is related to the mind the breath is related to the intellect That's something we don't really we don't really see things like that anymore, but It's a pretty obvious thing actually that your breath and your intellect are related because if you stop breathing I mean, I wouldn't I wouldn't recommend this but stop breathing for 20 minutes You lose consciousness Yeah Yeah, so so there's a clear connection between breath Consciousness and intellect and things of that. Yeah, you remember when we were kids people would play that game where they would choke someone That's a bad game, but people would like choke someone until they actually passed out It was like it was like a very disturbing game that people played but there's also so so the idea I was just just wanted to say that the idea is there is an obvious connection between heaven air Wind breath intellect that we don't necessarily see anymore But when you read the Bible you have to understand these connections in order to understand most of the stories in the Bible yeah, and also the one of the connections between breath and intellect is through the idea of word or logos because yeah, because speaking is the manifestation of intellect and speaking is Words are pushed by this breath breath pushes out the the sounds and so there's an odd there's a definite there's an obvious relationship between the manifestation of intellect and And and breath and you see that in the story of Genesis itself again when God speaks in order to Separate the the things of the world God speaks The then so you have to kind of almost see this image of this breath that is above of Above the earth that and then it becomes the vehicle for God's intellect to to manifest itself and create the world And importantly the first words that come out of God's mouth are Let there be light Okay so it says the The breath of God or the spirit of God or the wind of God hovered over the waters and then God said With that breath let there be light. So the light is In ancient cosmology is is is meaning you know, you represent the intellect the meaning the principle the idea So that which gives meaning to other things that which defines things it's It's the logos it's the word it's it's reason it's logic things are things of that nature. Yeah
