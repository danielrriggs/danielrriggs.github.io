 So you have the death of Adam at the bottom of the cross, then you have the death of Christ at the top of the cross, which is actually restoring the death of Adam. And then you see the blood of Christ going dripping down onto the skull of Adam in this like cave. And so often people are confused about seeing why is there a skull, you know, in the crucifixion, especially like if it's on a cross on someone, like they just see the skull at the bottom of the cross and they freak out and they wonder what it is, but it really is representing the mystery of the, really the mystery of the crucifixion. You know, it's like, we're so used to seeing Jesus on the cross that we just kind of dismiss it, but man, what's going on there is very, very mysterious and very strange because it is this ultimate trick played on death of kind of taking death into God and therefore, you know, transforming it, basically the joke of Hades and death thinking they've got God, cause they're bringing him down to death. And then it's like bringing a candle into the darkness. If you bring candle into the darkness, the opposite happens. Darkness doesn't win.
