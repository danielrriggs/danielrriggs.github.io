 It is through the personal transformation of people that the world is transformed. It is not firstly through political action, through political activism, through all these things. True transformation happens through you becoming a saint. If you become a saint, then you will transform reality. I'm not against being politically active, but if you think that that's how you're gonna fundamentally change reality, forget it. It's like, let's take the United States, for example. Like, you literally have a country that split 50-50 and then everybody's fighting for the few percentages to win the next election. And so, who is winning? Is anybody gonna win? How are you gonna win? Are you going to destroy 50% of the country? Are you gonna just eliminate everybody? Like, this kind of culture war stuff, that's why I try to avoid it as much as I can because the problem of the fragmentation is such a deep problem. It doesn't have a political solution. I'm not against it. I'm not against it. I'm not against it. I'm not against it. I'm not against it. I'm not against it. I'm not against it. I'm not against it. I'm not against it. I'm not against it. I'm not against it. I'm not against it. I'm not against it. I'm not against it. I'm not against it. I'm not against it. I'm not against it. I'm not against it. I'm not against it. I'm not against it. I'm not against it. I'm not against it. I'm not against it. I'm not against it. I'm not against it. I'm not against it. I'm not against it.
