 I think it's really important to just to get at this idea of the scapegoat mechanism becoming less effective because of society's concern for victims. You know, Girard would say this, our concern for victims is the universal value that now unites the world. Pretty much who will you ever find that says that you shouldn't be concerned with the victims? Injustice, right? And Girard says this is really the fruit of the revelation of the scapegoat mechanism. We've now seen something that we can never unsee and it sort of led over 2000, it led over a very long period of time to that becoming the most important value in the world to the point that there's now mimetic rivalry over who can be the best victim because nothing confers more status and power than becoming a good victim. It's a weird, weird paradox and inversion of like the true nature of Christianity.
