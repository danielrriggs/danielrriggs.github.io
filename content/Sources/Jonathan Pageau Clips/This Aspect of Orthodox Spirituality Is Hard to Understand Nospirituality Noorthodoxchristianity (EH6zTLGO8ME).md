 I think it's difficult to communicate sometimes to people because they're so caught up in the culture stuff. You have all these interesting stories of styrets like other paesios for example, you know, who encounters someone who has a certain passion, right? And that passion is clearly a passion which is against our tradition, like it's something which is not acceptable in the church. And discerns, like fighting this straight on is not the best way for this person's soul. So it's like, leave this alone, do this, pray. Do this other thing. I'm not saying that this aspect of your life is good, I'm not even saying that, but I'm saying, you know what? I want to save you, like, so let's do this, you know? And so I think that's hard to sometimes communicate to people because they'll immediately think, oh, so you're justifying behavior. And it's like, no, I'm not doing any of that.
