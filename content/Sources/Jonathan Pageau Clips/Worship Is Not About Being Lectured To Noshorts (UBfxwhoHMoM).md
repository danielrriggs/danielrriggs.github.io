 I'm noticing, like I'm seeing the type of person that I would have recognized before as being the punks, with these kind of edge of culture people who can see where it's going. I'm noticing that they're becoming Christians or becoming at least more traditional Christians. Yeah, I know a lot actually. I mean, that's the other thing I discovered with orthodoxy is that the liturgy is so powerful. The central ritual is so powerful. And again, a lot of the work I've done with mythologists and reading of myths from cultures around the world, a culture can't survive without central rituals. And there are always rituals which are designed to take people to the divine in some way, beyond ourselves. And we haven't got that. And even our Christianity hasn't had that for a long time in Protestant countries anyway. Sure, I mean, you still probably do the Eucharist and stuff, but it's a bit by the by. Really what you're getting is a lecture. And that's what I always thought Christianity was, that it's a lecturer who tells you what Jesus wants you to do. Yeah. As soon as you experience a ritual, then you think, oh my goodness me, this is what it's supposed to be about. God's in the room.
