 All sin is born in thought and desire. It's not born in the body. The body will express yearnings, let's say, but the sinning all happens up at the middle part. And depending on how you direct your attention, where you direct your will, that's where the problem arises. The body is almost like the earth in the creation sense. It doesn't have value. It's just, there's nothing wrong or good about body. When you fall into the body, it's not because of the body. It's the desiring capacity, which is focused in the wrong direction. So instead of looking up, which would order the body, it looks down, it'll idolize the body, or fear for the bodily functions or whatever, and then that's what ends up, it's one of the things that ends up bringing about sin. It's so hard to break the Gnostic thinking. We always tend to think, you know, spirit good, body bad. It's so ingrained into us, but Christianity is really not about that. The problem happens in this desiring capacity.
