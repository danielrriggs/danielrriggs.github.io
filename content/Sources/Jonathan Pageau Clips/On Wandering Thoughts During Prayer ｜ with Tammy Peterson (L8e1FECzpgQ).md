 You know, I try to keep my mind on an intention, but it'll wander. My mind will wander. And it's interesting where it'll wander to. Often it'll wander to something I should attend to that day or that I have been avoiding, right? It's as if it gives space in my head. No, I think you're absolutely right. How can I say this? It's almost like sin in the sense that you're trying to attend to a prayer, right? You're trying to attend to something which is beyond you and something which is above you. And then there are these pesky things that are trying to intrude. On the one hand, you kind of want to be careful not to let those things intrude because you want to focus on the prayer. But if you can notice what things are intruding, then you realize what your sins are. Like you see your sins because it's usually, like you said, something that you should be attending to, something that you haven't dealt with or something that you said that you shouldn't have said and all these things that are that. And so it actually becomes an opportunity to repent, you can say.
