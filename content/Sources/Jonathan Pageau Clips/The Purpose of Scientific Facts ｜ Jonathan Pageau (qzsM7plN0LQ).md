 It's a hierarchy where all things are ordered and in their own place. Nothing in the world is bad in itself. There's nothing that is in the world that is bad in itself. It's always bad because it is not in its proper place. And I think that what has happened in terms of, we could not not science itself, but let's say scientism or the kind of scientism that someone like Dawkins would have, is that he is trying to make the material world into all that there is. And I think that the proper way would be for just things to be in a normal hierarchy is to understand that spiritual realities come first, moral realities come second, and then physical realities come third, let's say. It could be said in another way. That's a way to see it. When that happens, then the material world becomes subject to the higher laws. It kind of happens on its own. Right now, let's say doing that would eliminate a lot of the problems, let's say. All the problems of bioethics and the problems of creating massive and massive weapons of destruction that are more and more destructive. If things were ordered in a normal hierarchy, then we would pay attention to certain facts. We would want to use the discoveries to serve those higher purposes rather than whatever other nefarious purposes we can find for them. I don't know if that makes sense. And I'm sorry if it sounds like I have animosity towards science.
