 Human interaction is inevitably ritualistic. If you think that you're not constantly engaging in ritual behavior, try this, right? Try just staring at someone for like three minutes, nonstop, and see what happens. That person will become extremely uneasy when you speak to someone. You look at them in the eye, but you don't look at them in the eye for too long. You look at them in the eye, then you kind of look somewhere else, then you look at them in the eye, there's this rhythm, there's a kind of dancing that appears in our relationship. That rhythm is a ritualized reality. What's funny, especially for the argument saying that these rituals are natural or that they're meaningful, it's like, well, so are the religious rituals. You know, in a church, the actions that you pose are related to the reality that you are facing. Everything we do in church is not arbitrary. In church, we do things like bow. We bow before God. We bow before something which is higher than us. But we do that even amongst ourselves. So you see someone, you bow your head. What do you think you're doing when you're doing that? You're saying, I'm not putting myself above you.
