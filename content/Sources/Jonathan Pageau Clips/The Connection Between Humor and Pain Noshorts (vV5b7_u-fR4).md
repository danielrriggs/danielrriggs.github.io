 What is the connection between pain and humor? So it depends on what kind of humor, but there's for sure, there's one aspect of humor, which is the capacity to see when meaning isn't aligned. Pointing out things that are absurd or pointing to the hypocrisy of something, exposing things for not being right, you know, that seems to be a large part of what humor is. So either in the silliness of it, right, it's like silly absurd clowns doing silly things, or in the like exposing it, you know, like talking about taboos and exposing people's behaviors that aren't, that you're not allowed to talk about in the public, all these kind of things. So there seems to be definitely a relationship with exposing the place where heaven and earth are disconnected, where things are disconnected somehow. And that is pain. I mean, pain is that. So yeah, so it's interesting.
