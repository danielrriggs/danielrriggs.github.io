 Lewis loves to play with flipping things on its head, which I believe he really gets from Dante. Dante, you know, in the medieval cosmology, the earth is at the bottom, and then as you move out from earth at Mount Purgatory through Eden, up into the heavens, out into the third heaven, which would be the throne room and abode of God, what happens when Dante finally gets there is that the whole cosmos flips inside out. And all of a sudden, the throne of God, the revelation of Christ, the yellow rose of the church, is the center, and earth is the periphery. And it's this kind of spatial inversion, which I think Lewis loved. I think he really felt that the modern imagination had been inverted, and he's continually working to try and flip the way that we're understanding things.
