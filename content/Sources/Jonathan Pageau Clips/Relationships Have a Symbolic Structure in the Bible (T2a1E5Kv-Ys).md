 there are these sort of elements of seduction in the conversation between the serpent and Eve. Yeah, but the Bible functions like that. Like the Bible also will not say something like the serpent slept with Eve, but because of the structure of the conversation, you understand that she is submitting herself to him like she would to her husband in a way that suggests a kind of sexual union without necessarily having to like go into the idea that they actually united sexually. By the way, this happens all the way through Bible and in positive ways too, where for example, Christ, when he meets a Samaritan woman, the entire structure of the conversation is one of Christ taking her as a wife, but we know that he didn't marry her and he didn't sleep with her, but it's to signify the meaning of the relationship. you
