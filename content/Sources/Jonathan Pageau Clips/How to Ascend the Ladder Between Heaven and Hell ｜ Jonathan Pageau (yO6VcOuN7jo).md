 as we ascend the ladder, then we become what is at that ladder. It's not just a question of arbitrary judgment, or arbitrary, or like you did this and you didn't do this. It's to become something, to acquire a virtue. And as you acquire virtue, then you become that, which is at that level. And you become more and more in the image of God. So it's a process of transformation of the person. It's not just a bunch of rules you have to follow in order to go to heaven or to go to hell. That's not it. It's to become something. And what you become, that's paradise itself. To acquire the virtue is paradise. There's nothing else. That's what it is. To become something, and to enter the paradise is to become that which is in paradise. It's to be in the holy place, to have to be in a place in yourself and in your life where you can, are transparent to God. That God flows through you and you have nothing holding it back.
