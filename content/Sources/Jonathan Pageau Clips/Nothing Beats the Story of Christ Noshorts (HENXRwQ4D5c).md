 And I love what you're talking about, the sort of dissension on high to the lowly places. And that's what the logy is doing. And that's why Christ was concerned with the prostitutes, with the poor, with the sick, the lowest people of society. And that's why the last will be first. Why is the ocean the most powerful body of water? It's because it's the lowest body of water. All other bodies of water flow back into the ocean. That's what God is. God had to humble himself as the lowest so that everything can return back to him. And it's like, wow. Yeah, the story of Jesus is just crazy. You know, you can never get to the end of it. Every pasca, those services, they didn't just crush you. What is it that sentence, it says, talks about Jonah but referring to Christ, it says, Jonah came out of the fish as if from the bridal chamber. And it's like, came out of the monster as if from a bridal chamber. So can you have images like that anywhere else? Like this crazy contraction of like, yeah, anyways.
