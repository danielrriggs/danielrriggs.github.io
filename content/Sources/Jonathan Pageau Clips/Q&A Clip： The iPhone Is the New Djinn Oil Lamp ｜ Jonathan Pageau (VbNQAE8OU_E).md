 Alex Riddle says, does chat GPT represent the materializing of prophecy or something like that? You ask a mundane question and it provides a mundane response. But the way the AI reaches that response is shrouded in mystery, so it has something of the mystery element of prophecy, even if the actual response is anything but prophetic. Any other AI related thoughts would also be appreciated. Yeah, for sure. Everybody's thinking about AI right now, right? Because it's crazy and it's happening fast. In some ways, AI can kind of help us understand something that I think many people don't understand. I think that AI can probably help us understand divination better because in some ways it's kind of a hyper divination. It's a mirror. It's like a mirror of chaos that can be imprinted with a question, like pre-imprinted with our mind structure, and then it reflects back the answer, you could say. In some ways, I think there's definitely a relation between staring into a crystal ball. People think I'm crazy to say that. Divination is usually a kind of chaos, right? It's actually throwing bones or tossing dice or whatever, and then being able to, with a question, to interpret the result. I think that it's a very complex version of something like that. At least that's my... Because it doesn't know. It just doesn't know. It's just data, and it's just basically capable of perceiving relationships based on its training, which is trained by our human intelligence. Humans have told it what's good over and over, and the frame has been provided for it, and then that frame kind of holds things together, but it doesn't know. You know. Yeah. So, yeah. I wouldn't say prophecy. I would say divination is better than prophecy in terms of understanding, or at least kind of trying to approach what I think is happening. I think like divination, one of the problems with divination is that it's captured, right? It's like the problem with the genie. You think you want the genie to give you what you want, but you really don't. You don't want the genie to give you what you want with infinite power, because it will destroy you. I think the genie story is the best way to understand the problem of AI, and it's just starting. It's going to explode, and things are going to get crazy very fast. The other problem is, of course, the hidden part in the sense of the notion that the people that are training the AI are not gods. They're not god. They're not objective. They have their own biases, and those biases, it's as if you're giving, right? It's as if you're giving a nuclear weapon to your bias. It's like you're giving infinite power to your biases. Whatever little bias you have, now give it all this power, and all this data, and all these connections. It's like then it gets amplified, and maybe you don't even know your bias. Maybe you're actually unconscious to it. It doesn't matter. It still will get amplified incredibly. What you would want with an AI is you would want a philosopher king to be behind the AI. You'd want a very wise man to be the one training the AI, but obviously that's not happening. What you've got are nerds and people who want to make a lot of money. That's what you've got, so that's not the best intent for this stuff. Yvonne Engel says, Vin Armani said the iPhone is the new gin oil lamp. Yeah, Vin is right on that. I think he's right about the idea that in some ways it's already there. In the story of the genie is the idea that it rises out of technology. It rises out of a container, a technical container, because that's what a technical container is. A technical thing is an increase in power in itself. An oil lamp is the way to have light at night. You can't have light at night. It's dark. What do you do? You make a supplement. You make a technical object that will provide more power to you and will be able to give you light at night. The genie and the oil lamp, the genie is just an extrapolation of what technology gives you already, but times a thousand, times a million or whatever. Vin's insight, I think Vin's insight is completely right.
