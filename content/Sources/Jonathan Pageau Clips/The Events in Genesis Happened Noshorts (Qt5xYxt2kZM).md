 The events in Genesis happened. They're just being remembered at a cosmic level using narrative structures and images that compress so much into them that people have written thousands of books unfolding the implicit meanings contained in those primordial stories. The more we move away from the idiosyncratic how-my-day-went stories, the more we move towards remembering events which have universal significance. The more this memory will appear symbolic, condensed. It has to be, so that it can be remembered by larger and larger groups over larger and larger spans of time. Does that mean that what's in the Bible does not describe events? Of course it describes events. The problem is that we think that all events are the same. We think that Adam, which means man as such ate the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil, becoming self-conscious of his mortality, is on the same level, the same type of event that when I'm washing the dishes. That's the problem.
