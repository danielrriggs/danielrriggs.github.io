 The image of usurpation itself, or the image of the pride of Satan, is the devil wants to become our God. The devil wants to be for us what is God, and then take over creation, and that becomes, in some ways, trying to make creation his wife. Right? It's like that's what the devil is always trying to do, and that's what every single temptation that you face is trying to do for you. So it's like where every sin that tempts you is trying to make you its wife, is trying to come up above and master everything underneath, and use it as its body in order to be able to grow and to have more power in the world. So it's like a fractal thing that happens at every level of reality, this idea of something which wants to come up, usurp, and then take the body for itself.
