 making beautiful things, beautiful art and music, it's a good strategy in terms of our current situation. Ultimately, I think that will survive the popcorn, the superficial advertisement culture, where you can make beautiful things that are integrated into people's lives and also directed towards God and directed towards the highest things. Even I had a good friend of mine who is an atheist and modern person. He said, you know what you're doing is also kind of just nostalgic. It's just nostalgia. It's just pastiche. And my answer was, well, it's not nostalgia for the person that buys an icon for their nephew that's getting baptized. I don't know what to tell you. It just isn't. If I make a chalice for a church and there's wine in it, it's not nostalgia. You can say what you want. It's a real thing. It's really happening.
