 Adam asked hi Jonathan in Mark 8 22 to 26 Jesus leads a blind man out of the village Heals him and tells him not to return. I can't figure out why all this about leaving the village and not returning Could you connect some dots? They come to Bethesda and some people brought a blind man and begged us to touch him took the blind man By the hand and let him outside the village When he had spit on the man's eyes and put his hands on him Jesus asked do you see anything? He looked up and said I see people they look like trees walking around Once more Jesus put his hands on the man's eyes Then his eyes were open his sight was restored and he saw everything clearly Jesus sent him home saying don't even go into the village Well, I think that this is one of the ways to understand it is that at least at the beginning You get the feeling that Christ is Wants to remain so much secretive about what he's doing and so he doesn't want His miracles to be known at first and so you can almost see it as a as a seed that's kind of growing You know So he starts small with the disciples does a miracle with his disciples and then he starts to do miracles more and more and he Warns people not to talk about his miracles at the beginning and then it's as if you can see like a kind of progressive Revelation that happens through his story I think that it has something to do with that there are other places where he tells people not to talk about his miracles That's a really interesting story that story I was talking about that today with Neil deGrade of dirt for Robbins we were talking about this story and how it's interesting about that story is this idea that Christ as well he spits on his eyes and You know you can kind of see it as this water coming from above That's how I understand it the fact that he takes the person outside the village You can imagine it as so the way that you can kind of see it is almost as if like he's taking the Beggar the blind beggar outside the village, so he's manifesting. He's bringing them out into chaos You could say you're outside of the city and so He's which is manifesting He's which is manifesting what he is which is a blind beggar so he's an outside figure And so he's taking him to where he is and then he spits from above and so he he sends the water Coming coming down from above like like rain or you know like meaning coming from above and That's what heals him but the weird thing about the story is the first part where at first he says I see people they look like trees walking around and And then Christ has puts his hands on the man's eyes like it's like he covers his eyes and Then his his eyes open up, and then he sees things normally and so it's weird It almost feels like at first his vision was too high It's like at first he just sees patterns see these trees right these patterns walking around Does if Christ has to kind of lower his vision a little bit by covering his eyes and Then he's able to kind of see the flesh you know it feels like that's what it's what's going on in that story But you know it's very mysterious. I mean there's so many things about Christ which are very mysterious
