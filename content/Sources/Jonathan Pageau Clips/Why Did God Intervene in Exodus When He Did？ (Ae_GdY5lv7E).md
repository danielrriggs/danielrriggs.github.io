 Why did God intervene when He did? Did you suggest that in effect God was looking for the right person all this time? There's a direct parallel with the flood and the killing of the Hebrew children. You have to understand it almost as if they're all dead except for Moses. All the males have been killed except for Moses. There's just one. It's a reduction. There's like this reduction. So think about Noah as well. Like everybody's dead. There's just one. There's this reduction which manifests the seed. The story of Superman is the same story. It's like his whole planet is dead and now this last one is as if he's gathered into himself all of the nature of what he is and now he is going to recast it. And then the story of Christ, you have the same image where the king kills the children. And it's not that God wants that to happen. God transforms evil into good. It's like this is the worst thing that could happen. Like kill all the children and then all of a sudden God's like, no, there's one. We're going to replant the seed. And so you can't get rid of it. It's like its meaning will return. The law will return. The covenant will return.
