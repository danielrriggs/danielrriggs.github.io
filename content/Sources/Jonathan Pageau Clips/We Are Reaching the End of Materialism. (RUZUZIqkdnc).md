 We have this idea that there's the world, the world has these rules, and we just have to look at them and we can measure, and we can calculate, and then we can just say, here's how it works, we figured it out. But we're coming to the end of that, where they realize, once we've reduced everything to the material world, we have a problem. Because then you have to explain the spiritual stuff. Because before that, they could kind of ignore it. You go, this is stupid. Let's not talk about that, we're just gonna talk about this material stuff. Then you reach the end of it, you're like, okay, we encompass everything in this material stuff. Let's take that stuff, that spiritual stuff, like consciousness, human experience, identities, qualities. How do you now fit that into your material world? And they're struggling to do it. So they come up with words like emergence. Why is it that we know that something has parts, but it's also one thing at the same time? St. Max's gives us a key that the human person, consciousness plays a part in bringing things together, in making things one. You need a conscious agent to be able to say that terror is a bunch of stuff, but it's also one thing, that jump into unity. And that's how St. Max's talks about us. That's what we do, that's what we are. That's what makes us special in creation. That's what makes us not only special, that's what makes us in the image of God.
