 Was discussing with a friend who is Christian the relationship between truth and love and which is of higher rank I claimed love and he claimed truth arguing that love is an emotion that can fool you or be Manipulated to a degree but that truth was binary binary and clear-cut sort of a mathematics versus language juxtaposition and Therefore supreme what are your thoughts? It's even fair to try and is it even fair to try and put these into a hierarchy It's funny because that conversation is one of the very first conversations that I had with Jordan Peterson because I Remember we had met the for the very first time we had met at some event that he gave about Men I forget what it was and it was like a debate he had about men and then We're gonna go to the restaurant together, but he wanted to walk it so we're walking No, we're walking back to his house after the restaurant We're kind of walking and then we started talking about this this and he was saying that he thought truth was at the top of the hierarchy and I was saying that it's love and And so I can lay it out for you why I think that it's love I think that it's love just like st. Paul says right the the the highest of these is love is is because we need to understand love as The very manner by which things exist right the very manner by which the question and the answer Can can exist the very manner by which? An identity can encounter a Something that's not their identity and then coexist right love is the possibility for Multiplicity and unity to to to to coexist that's that to me. That's the highest Definition of love it's it's we are one together without you without multiplicity going away It's like one and the many at the same time. That's what love is and so to me that is the prerequisite for for truth to even be concept for even to be anything and Love is in a way beyond Being in in the strict sense that we understand it in the sense that it's the It is right. It's the manner by which being can even lay itself out because for being to to be there has to there has to be identity and not identity or identity and multiplicity for for for for you be able to even See anything for anything to to exist And so yeah for sure I'm with st. Paul on that I think the highest of these is love
