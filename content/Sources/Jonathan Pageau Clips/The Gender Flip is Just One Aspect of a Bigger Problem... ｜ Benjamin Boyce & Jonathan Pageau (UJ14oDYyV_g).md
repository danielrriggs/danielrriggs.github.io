 So we've spoken about the feminine before and and we've spoken about revolution before we've we spoke about the inversion and the You know clown world stuff before but maybe there is one of the ambitions of my literary work is to take all the genres of literature and Allow males and females to have discourse throughout all the different genres or the masculine the feminine and I see that there's a lot of work to do to Give females story and and to put females in in story that doesn't mean Masculinizing them but making them present throughout all these different genres So is there not some sort of work to do to? Give more Female stories give more representation of the feminine and in the rush to do that That's the problem that we're seeing is that people aren't really Honoring the feminine they're just trying to represent the feminine within the mold that already works being the adventure story being with what Disney does with that one Southern Pacific Islander movie, I can't remember Mona or something like that So I think that if I think the problem that it's inserting itself in a whole other few other things happening at the same time So it's not just that this is happening and like I said, it's that there's it there's a sense in which The fetish fit I can never say it's where it fetish eyes a Fetishization of The the stranger is part of it, too Right the idea that we love things that aren't us more than us the idea that it's like it's okay Everybody wants to be a Buddhist everybody wants to be go to India Everybody wants to to do all the things that aren't your own story Except for your own story. So it's okay to be anything except for what you are. So that's actually that's actually a Can I say this that's a bigger trope and and the idea of the switch between genders is just one aspect of this larger? situation and it has to do it really has to do with the problem of kind of reaching Reaching the edge of a world like reaching the end of something where all of a sudden That so you saw that like for example the Romans in the second during the the what is it? The third century crisis or whatever they had that problem where all the young people were dressing as barbarians and They they were trying to imitate their own enemies their own Because they were it's as if their culture was like running out or as if they were so They took it so much for granted. Maybe that then then they were just looking towards the outside and And so it's all it's all part of that. And so it also has to do so so it's not just that it also has to do with like sexuality, which is that the idea that We want all types of sexuality except for the one that produces children is also part of that It's like all types of sexualities are okay The only one that's suspicious is the one that produces children and so it actually it's it's just this constant it's it's a general pattern of basically running out of steam and then Coming into the coming into something which would be the upside down coming into the the edge of an identity, which is its opposite So that's what it seems like we're so the the man the masculine feminine thing is just one part of it Every but all it's all happening together and at the same time
