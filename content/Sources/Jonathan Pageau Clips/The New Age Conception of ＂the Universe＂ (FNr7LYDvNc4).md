 I knew there was a reason for everything, but I would always refer to it as the universe. Yeah, I hear people do that all the time. I ask the universe and it's beautiful because it's like, I know you want to say God, my friend, because nobody talks to the universe. We talk to people. You know that, right? Like you don't talk to trees, you don't talk to a cardboard box. They know language is a human thing. It's a human connection. And so to represent God as a person, that's the way God has revealed himself to us. But we also know that he is beyond that definition. But we know that he reveals to us as a person and that's why we're made in the image of God. But the universe is like, okay, so who are you talking to? The universe is answering you. So I guess the universe is, it's like the body of God, I guess, the way maybe they think of it. They don't want the transcendent aspect. They just want all of creation. It's like, I'm talking to all of creation. They're obsessed with the creation and not the creator.
