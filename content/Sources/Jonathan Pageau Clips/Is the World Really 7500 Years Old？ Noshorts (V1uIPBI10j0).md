 Is it orthodox doctrine that the world is roughly 7,500 years old? That's how the orthodox count the dates. They do some backtracking in order to calculate the generations in order to reach, let's say, the beginning of Genesis. Well, is it doctrine? I mean, it's definitely orthodox tradition. I think that our world is 7,500 years old. I don't have a problem with that. Pretty good estimate in terms of understanding when any memory that we have, any tradition, any actual connection to the past that we have seems to not go beyond that. We don't have any tradition which goes before, let's say, the beginning of the Mesopotamian culture, let's say. So I would say our world is about that old, no matter how you look at it. I'm probably confusing you guys by saying that stuff.
