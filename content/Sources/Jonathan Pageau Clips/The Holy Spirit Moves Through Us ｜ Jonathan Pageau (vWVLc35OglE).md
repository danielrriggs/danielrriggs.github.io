 Even just triumphing over something that you know is like a persistent sin in your life, even triumphing over it for one day or even on one occasion, you know, not going to that website that you know isn't good for you, you know, like not spending three hours sort of scrolling social media over and over again, cycling through the same four apps. The feeling of spiritual strength that you get from just like triumphing over that sin with God's help, through God's power and love is a real experience. It can be an immediate experience and it can show you that what seems like an insurmountable task, you can really approach it one little step at a time and actually get real results in your life that start radiating through the rest of your life. That stuff is powerful and it is pretty basic, but it feels out of reach for many people and the only way that they can really believe and experience otherwise I think is through example. You can talk about it a lot and that's fine, but if they don't see their fellow human beings actually doing this stuff in their real life, it's all going to feel very abstract. So, you know, yeah, go into the woods, go into the desert, but we also got to go into the marketplace, got to go into society, we got to mix it up with our fellow human beings and show them and participate. That's how the Holy Spirit moves through us.
