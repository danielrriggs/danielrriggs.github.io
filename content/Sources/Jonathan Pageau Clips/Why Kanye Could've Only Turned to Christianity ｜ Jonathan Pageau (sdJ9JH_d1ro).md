 So there are many other artists in North America that are coming out of contemporary art, and that's the thing too that is, when I told you about Kanye West and this kind of reaching the end, you kind of reach the bottom at some point. And that's why you have to watch the fools, because the fools, they reach the bottom, and then the only place to go is up. And a lot of the people who are making icons or traditional art in North America are people who came out of contemporary art and just reached the wall of contemporary art. And this impossibility of doing something authentic. Contemporary art is cynical and is cynical upon cynical. It's a comment upon a comment upon a comment, and it references and references, and it's just like a, but you can't make an authentic statement in contemporary art. It is, people would hate it. And so what do you do if you want to make an authentic, something that's direct, that's not removed, twice removed, three times removed? Well, the only solution that is viable, the only last participative thing left in the West is still the church. That's the last thing.
