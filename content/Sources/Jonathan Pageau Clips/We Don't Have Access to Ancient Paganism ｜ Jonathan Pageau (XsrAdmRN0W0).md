 The idea that you have access to mythreism is such bullshit. This is the weird, like, modern world where people think that religions are things that you take in books and you can just study that something from thousands of years ago and that you could somehow just practice. That that's not how any of this works. These are living things. They're living beings. They're living organic realities that are transmitted from one generation to another. They're behaviors. They're ways of thinking that cannot be even contained in books. It's not about books and about studying. It's about embodied practice connected to our father, as you could say, receiving from the people before. It's just like you learn to brush your teeth or that you learn to do all these things. Like, you wouldn't study how to brush your teeth in a book. And so mythreism is dead. Mythreism doesn't exist anymore. Maybe there are some things about mythreism that we could study that could help complement our practices, that could maybe help us have some insight into the things that we're living now. But the idea that you could just resuscitate these old, like, dead religions is absolute nonsense.
