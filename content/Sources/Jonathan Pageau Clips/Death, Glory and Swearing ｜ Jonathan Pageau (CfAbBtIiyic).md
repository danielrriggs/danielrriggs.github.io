 Does swearing hold any symbolic meaning explaining why it is avoided by Christians? Put another way, is there a common pattern between swearing to make people laugh versus swearing out of anger? Um, I think swearing is a very very interesting subject. It is extremely interesting, especially the The the you know, the religious word swearing, you know, not just like The cursing, you know, like not just not just saying dirty words of but of course that is also related to it, but you can you can understand it more in terms of You know using god's name in vain or using or saying things like damn or saying things, you know Uh in quebec, we have a whole culture of using church words in swearing So people use every single word tabernacle chalice, um, you know, um They it's like sacristy they use the word Uh, it's like every single thing in a church and every and and of course they'd use the name of christ the name of christ You know, you in english you have people use the name of the mother of god uh in vain you would say and so There's a there's a relationship There's an interesting there's an interesting idea This is something that i've been trying to kind of point you guys to in terms of trying to understand the incarnation And trying to understand the mystery that christ brings to us Is how there's a relationship between death and glory? I keep keep trying to try to show you that and I don't want you to confuse the two You know, I don't want you to think that Death and glory, you know if you if you're In the world of death, that's not good. It's bad. It's not it's it's very bad But you have to understand the way that people kind of Flip out of it the way that christ kind of brought us out of death through death is is something which you see Happen at all kind of levels in my last video I talked about you know the relationship between the ark of the covenant and this kind of weird Growing cancer that was developed in this these these growths in the hidden parts that were developed by the israelites And how they had to make golden hemorrhoids golden Aspects and mice in order and return the ark to the temple in order to kind of be healed from their disease it's all related and so and so the idea that When you are in a moment of passion when you're in a moment where meaning breaks down and you lack words to to uh, let's say You lack words to express What is happening? uh Then you would use these church words in a distorted and perverse way Because the there's this weird relationship between the lowest and the highest there's a very strange A strange connection between the two and I talked about this in terms of the crown of thorns In terms of a whole bunch of symbolism, which is in christianity and so This is why You know, this is why you could say like if you imagine how when the the roman soldiers are Insulting christ you can imagine that that's the same when someone is swearing when someone is using the name of christ or the name Of the virgin mother or just using god's name in vain that they are mocking that they are treating as nothing right there Acting as if these holy things are just nothing and you connect them to your passion to some lack of you know, uh, you know Giving up on words almost like an onomatopoeia, you know almost like a grunt That you could see how that is what the roman soldiers are doing and christ is Taking that and bringing it back into the highest bring it back into the holy place So it's related as well to I talked about this this idea of the nakedness in the garden um and The nakedness of shame, right? The nakedness of adam in the garden and the nakedness of noah drunk in his tent, right that they're They're the same They're like the same thing but they're at the opposite ends of each other There one is at the beginning one is at the end, you know, and then christ takes that and flips it right? He's naked on the cross being persecuted being mocked All of that is happening, but he is changing the nakedness of noah into the nakedness in the garden So that is also The pattern of swearing has to do with this pattern as well. It's just something inevitable. Um So don't swear guys, it's not good for your soul You
