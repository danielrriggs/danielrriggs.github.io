 You keep talking about this whole idea of the vertical relationship and then the horizontal relationship, the two covenants we could say, and then the commandments are structured like that in themselves. So they start with the vertical. It starts with, you know, I am the only God, I am God, you have no gods in front of me. Then there's a transition in the Sabbath day, which now brings creation into the story. It says God created the world in six days. The seventh day, you will honor the Sabbath. And then we move now to the horizontal plane. And now we start to talk about how it is that we interact with each other. So the text, the Ten Commandments are structured exactly in the very pattern that we've been seeing happening from the beginning. And the way it's structured, this law, then in the New Testament, Christ resumes it to one saying. He says, love God, love your neighbor. That's it. That's the law. The whole law is that. But of course, it has to be shown to us. It has to be kind of exemplified in all these different ways for us to kind of get it. But that's it. The vertical and the horizontal. Without the vertical, the horizontal falls apart.
