 So David Flores says in Genesis 47, 15, 20, due to a famine in the land, the people give goods to Joseph in exchange for bread. It begins with gold and cattle, then their bodies and their land. In reading this, it's struck as strange as I've seen the more heavenly items, manna or seed, come down from above and earthly items, flesh or crops, offered upward from below. Could you elaborate the meaning of this pattern of heavenly earthly items all being offered from below? So this is super important. Like this pattern is super important because Joseph is giving grain. That's my understanding. Is he giving grain or is he giving bread? I think he's giving grain. And even if he's giving bread, I think you kinda have to understand it as grain, even if it's bread. It's like a transformed version of the grain. And so then people give, then you have people giving from below to be able to stay alive from above. And what's important in understanding the story of Joseph is that there's something, you know, it's funny because people always, I always tell people that the Bible characters have two sides. All the Bible characters have a dark side to them. And this is better to understand it that way because if we wanna look at the Bible characters as just being models for us, we're going to run into a wall pretty fast because none of them really are completely. But there always is Joseph, which people always think, see that Joseph is, you know, there's something about Joseph which is hard to see, you know, where he totally does wrong. He's the victim, you know, he gets taken to Egypt. But Joseph is something like the man who is too good. And so you can see how him being good and him being heavenly and him not being able to be tempted, to be tempted, let's say from below, when you see him fleeing from Potiphar's wife, you know, and being willing to leave his garment in order to kind of stay pure. And stay in the garden, you could say, when he leaves his garment with Potiphar's wife, leaves his garment with her, it's almost like he's going into the garden, right? So there's this idea that Joseph is this pure, but then he becomes too pure and he has an excess of order. So if you want to understand like a secret in that story is that the way that Joseph saved Egypt, the way that Joseph saved Egypt gave ultimate power to the Pharaoh because everybody traded all their land and centralized power in the Pharaoh by the manner in which Joseph saved Egypt. And because he did that, that's why the Pharaoh could enslave the Israelites was because he had handed over total central power to the Pharaoh in the manner in which he saved Egypt. And so the Bible is a very powerfully pattern. If you pay attention, it's never made explicit, but if you look at actions and consequences of actions and you kind of see it follow through, there's all this subtext, which is very, very powerful. And the idea that all the Egyptians were giving up their stuff and then ultimately when they give their land, then they centralize the power of Egypt. And a centralized power is able to treat its strangers by enslaving them. So I love Joseph, he's great, but it's just good to see how the Bible works. All right. I'm going to go to bed.
