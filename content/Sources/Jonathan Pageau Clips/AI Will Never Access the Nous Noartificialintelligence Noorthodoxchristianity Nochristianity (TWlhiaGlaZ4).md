 How does a child learn what a cat is? It encounters a cat. Then someone says that's a cat. And it takes a couple of iterations of this. All right. Why can't AI do it? Because human beings have what the ancients call intuition. Intuition is direct, unmediated access to reality. I can imagine the skeptic listening to this saying, oh, wait a second, of course it's mediated, right? But let us say, OK, fine, it's all relative. On the scale of relativity, this is the most direct, unmediated thing. Yeah. In the Orthodox tradition, the noose is the highest form of knowledge, right? It's more than knowledge in the sense of the way that we think of thinking or whatever. It is direct grasping in the Orthodox kind of mystical theology. The noose is the capacity we have to also be united with God, because it's the capacity we have to have direct grasping of the things around us. But then ultimately, it's that which also makes us possible to enter into the embrace of God, because it's a type of knowledge that isn't just intellectual. It really is like the fullness of your being, you know, joining with something.
