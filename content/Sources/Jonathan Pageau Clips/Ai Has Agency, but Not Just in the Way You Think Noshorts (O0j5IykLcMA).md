 Everybody talks about the agency of the AI, right? It's like, does AI have agency? Does AI have consciousness? Is AI a person? But what's fascinating about the Moloch problem is that it can help people notice that one of the main problems isn't the AI itself and its agency and its consciousness, it's the rapid acceleration of implementation. The fact that people are blindly running towards implementation under a kind of agency that isn't in the AI. So the AI is acting on you, but not through like chat GPT. It's acting on you outside of its software. It's making you build a body for it. It's like Sauron using your desires and your desire for power to make a body for it. Right. And the mythologies and the stories, things like inciting greed or lust for power or fear is an aspect of how this sort of disembodied agency causes humans to act in the world on its behalf.
