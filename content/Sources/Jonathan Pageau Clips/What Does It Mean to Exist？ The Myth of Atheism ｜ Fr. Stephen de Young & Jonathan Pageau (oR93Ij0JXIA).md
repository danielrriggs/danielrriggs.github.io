 That's because atheism is a myth. Not in the sense I usually use myth. In the bad sense, in the way they use it. I'm not really existing because every atheist is dragging around the dead body of the god he doesn't believe in. Yeah. Behind him, right? Because a negation can't exist. There's a joke from an old movie that Slavoj Zizek, of all people, uses to illustrate this, that a negation can't exist. Where a guy is at a restaurant and he says to the waiter, can you bring me a cup of coffee, sugar, but hold the cream? And the waiter comes back a few minutes later and says, I'm sorry, sir, we don't have any cream. Can we hold the milk instead? That's amazing. So to have no cream, right, you have to have cream. Exactly. A negation can't exist without the thing it's negating. No, I think you're so right. That's something that I've been kind of pointing to. I did a video on this weird Anuan division and the Montero video, like this kind of weird satanic moment. And I also did one on the inverted pentagram talking about this. How, in fact, these kind of satanic tropes are this strange dark mirror that ultimately will reflect back to God. Even if it's not in their will to do that, even if they're doing it despite themselves, it ends up bringing back the image of God. Because, like you said, the negation can't exist. It always is pointing to it. And the parasite needs its host. The parasite can try to feed off its host, but in the end it has to reaffirm the host or else it's going to die itself. Can't live without the host. Yeah. And so there's no sort of secular, there's no sort of neutral, there's no sort of bare bones. Well, we've stripped away all of the, you know, or banished any kind of meaning or spiritual significance to this place, person, thing, idea. Right. Yeah, it would cease to exist. It would have to just cease, completely cease to exist for you to banish any form of sacred from a person or from anything. Because that's the actual shape of how it exists. It's the actual pattern of how it's there and how you even notice it out of the millions of things you don't notice. Because it has the same pattern as this little holy place, you know, where you see things come together and are in communion into something. Yeah, and that's been probably the hardest nut to crack on Lord of Spirits has been people's idea that existing means, you know, this mug exists because I can bang on it. You know, like, it has physicality to it. That means it's exist as opposed to existence, meaning it has an order and a form. And so the opposite being chaos, not an imaginary void or whatever it is that they think. Yeah, yeah. I mean, literally the the words that that get translated as nothingness or non-existence in English, usually in Greek. Is Tomy on right, which literally means that which isn't being being is a verb there. It's a participle. So it's that which is not doing the action of being or existing. So when people try to push back on me and say, well, no, look, see, there's nothingness in the ancient world, I say, OK, what's that? What's the pronoun referring to? Because a pronoun has a referent, right? Yeah. And so that referent is chaos, right? That referent or prime matter or pure becoming, depending on your age, your philosopher, however you want to. Yeah, the only nothing you could say, the only nothing in this is going to sound weird to people, but the only nothing is God in the sense of that he's not a thing. Right. And so that object of the world. Right. And so when we say that God created out of nothing, we don't mean that there was this nothing that was there that God created out of. It just means that that that that God is the origin of all and the origin of chaos, even like the origin of all possibility and of all actuality is in this infinite. No thing, no beyond being whatever you going straight into Dionysus, the erotic guide, trying to find words for things that can't be named. But but that's really the only thing that is really nothing in the in the strict sense, let's say. I like the way St. John Chrysostom phrases it in his anaphora because he talks about God bringing all things, bearing or carrying the moving all things from that which is not being to being. So then you really have this idea of moving from potentiality into actuality. Right. And of causation, causation. Yeah. And putting and being the one who puts things in order. Yeah, that makes a lot that makes definitely makes a lot of sense in terms of understanding.
