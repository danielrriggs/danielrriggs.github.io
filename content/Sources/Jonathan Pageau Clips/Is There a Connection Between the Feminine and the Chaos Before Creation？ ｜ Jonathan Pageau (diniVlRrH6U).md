 Is there any connection between the feminine and the chaos in the beginning before creation in Genesis? Mostly thinking in terms of the theotokos or the holy spirit. So for those who don't know the word theotokos means uh the the mother of god or the one who brought forth god, um, I would say that I would say that in a certain manner yes, I would say yes that there is a connection between the notion of the feminine and the uh, the unformedness of create of the earth before before uh before total creation and so you have to see the first duality heaven and earth as let's say the first opposition In in creation it is it's interesting because in the bible it's there. It says in the beginning god created heaven and earth and it's almost It's very mysterious the way it's presented because it is presented in a manner even before god spoke uh creation into being and so god did Create it, but there is a very mysterious aspect to this very kind of primordial um the primordial elements, let's say of the world and so It's important not to see the primordial chaos In the world as being let's say simply the feminine Uh, there is it's a more it's a more encompassing category, but you can see analogies between What let what the feminine aspect of of reality is and what this kind of primordial, uh Chaos is as well. Um, i've written an article about that about i've written several articles about that, um about the um Let's say the duality of the primordial chaos how it is both in a manner life bringing but there's also an aspect of it, which is sterile and uh let's say um bitter you could say and so and in that symbolism you find several types of the feminine in this in scripture this notion of you really see it in this notion of the infertile woman who finally is able to give birth or the uh, the the woman who loses her Children and then finally announces and we see this in the story of ruth where uh, Naomi loses her husband and her sons and then finally having lost all the fruit of her womb She says, you know, my name is now mara, which means bitter And the word bitter mara the the root of that word will then appear in different feminine names including It was there in the name merriam, which is the sister of moses But it is also there mysteriously in the name of mary, which is the mother of god And so I will once the recording is finished I will link to that article to the few articles that I wrote about that in in the uh, the descriptions
