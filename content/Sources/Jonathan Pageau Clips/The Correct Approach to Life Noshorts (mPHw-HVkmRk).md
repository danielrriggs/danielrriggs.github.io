 The reason why I think it's important is because I also want to recapture the little old lady, very simple person who says, God will take care of me. Because that's in that mode. I actually don't know what's going to happen. I don't know what's going to happen. But I have an orientation. Something like, I know that God wants the best of me. And the thing is that that might mean that you're going to get dragged in the street and you're going to get killed and all these horrible things are going to happen to you. But that mode of anticipation is the best mode to stand in in order to face whatever horrible thing the future has in front of you. And it's not predictive. It's not at all predictive. It's just a stance. Which is like, all that is given will be taken as the grace of God.
