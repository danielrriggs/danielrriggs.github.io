 Modern psychology is useful to humans because it tends to reduce something into manageable parts so we can comprehend it. Myth plays a very different move. It doesn't reduce the heat, it amplifies it. It plays it on a symphonic, vast level. So we see it and we are, because I think most of us really, you know, we're fed usually by images rather than concepts. This sheer radiance of mythology tells me more quicker about an internal situation, rather than necessarily turning the heat down to a point in that we get in many traditional kind of therapists office. So this amplification with myth, reduction with psychology. I'm not saying either, I'm not saying psychology should be abandoned for a second. It's just something to be aware of.
