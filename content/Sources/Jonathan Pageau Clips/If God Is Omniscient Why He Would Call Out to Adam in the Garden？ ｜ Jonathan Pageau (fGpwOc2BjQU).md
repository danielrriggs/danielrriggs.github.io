 So David Koziar for 1144 CID, do you have any thoughts on NASA system and why God would be calling out asking where Adam is in the garden? Could this be a demiurge, the false God speaking since it's not omniscient? Thanks. So this is really, this is actually a really important question in the sense that everything that God does in scripture, everything that God says, every way that you see God in scripture is a condescension. And so, the idea that God acts out in the world in a way that humans can understand, it doesn't mean that it's a demiurge or a false God, it just means that since God is the source of all reality, then God manifests himself at the level of reality that is appropriate to whatever God is, wherever God is appearing in the world. And so we can't see these gestures or the fact that God appears as an angel or that God appears in the burning bush or that God appears in these different things or as the glory of God that descends in the temple. We can't see that as a limiting of God, but rather just, let's say, just God revealing himself at the level where he's revealing himself and then pointing ultimately to something that transcends that manifestation. So anyways, that's the way I understand it. It's the best way I understand it. ["The Star-Spangled Banner"]
