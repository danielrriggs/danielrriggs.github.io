 So Elijah Stonebreaker in the question asked, what is the symbolism of Black Friday? Basically Black Friday's symbolism happens. It's revealing what the God is. And it's happening without anybody planning it, without it being on purpose. It's like it's emergent liturgy in the sense. What it's doing is that most of us in the West worship money. Worship success, worship comfort. These are the things that we worship. And so we can have a celebration like Christmas and Thanksgiving. But what happens is those celebrations get transformed by the real God that's ruling over us. And Black Friday is really, let's say, the God appearing. It's saying there's going to be a holiday that is absolutely coherent in all its symbolism. That nobody planned for, that nobody decided. And if you ask like, why is it called Black Friday? Why is that? It's like in terms of mechanical causes, it has nothing to do with anything ominous. It just means that's the Friday when companies used to be in the black because they would finance their operations until around this moment where Christmas sales would put them out of the red. And then from then on, everything they would make from that day forward would just be profit. And so the idea is let's maximize the sales, get rid of all our inventory, get ready for the next year. And whatever money we make, even if we sell something 50% off, it's like it's all 100% profit anyway. So it's like it's just basically amassing profit and trying to sell as much as possible on the inventory that you would plan for for that year. So they're like, that's the mechanical cause of Black Friday, but it's still Black Friday. You know, and the people fighting in the US, especially in Canada, we don't have it so bad. But like watching those videos of people, you know, fighting, trampling over each other, waiting it from, you know, 5 a.m. for the stores to open and just like rushing into stores to get their stuff. It's a ritualized thing. You know, it's equivalent to the running of the bulls or whatever other thing that has established itself in other cultures for a very long time. And it's revealing the God, you know, it's showing you what it is that that we worship. And I'm saying it like I'm being careful, like I'm saying this, not like I'm not even saying it as just a straight up criticism. It's just, you know, it's hard for all of us, right? You know, you celebrate Christmas and you want to get gifts for your kids and you want to make sure everybody has a good time. And so you kind of put put a lot of effort into that. And then you notice that your kids, that's what they're thinking about, right? That's what they care about the most. And you think, oh, no, it's about Christ. You know, it's about Christ. And you try. But it's hard because it really is a battle to fight against the principalities that are ruling over us. And so you're going to have to fight against the principalities that are ruling over you. And so you're going to have to fight against the principalities that are ruling over you. And so you're going to have to fight against the principalities that are ruling over you. And so you're going to have to fight against the principalities that are ruling over you. And so you're going to have to fight against the principalities that are ruling over you.
