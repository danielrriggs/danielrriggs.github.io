 I used to think that atheists, that when atheists proclaimed their allegiance to the flying spaghetti monster, that they were just joking. But now I'm starting to think that because they elevate the scientific process, that they elevate something which is itself a denial of any elevation, that maybe they do worship at least akin to the spaghetti monster. Because they don't understand that analogies of hierarchy are coherent, that we move from the specific to the specific and quantifiable, which is what science attempts to describe, to the origin of existence, the purpose. The purpose, which is also the capacity to even see, to even consider specific and quantifiable things. We move from the feet to the head, from the earth to the spirit, from the children to the father, from the darkness to the light. And all religious images are completely coherent as they place themselves on the hierarchy of being. But if one thinks that earth is more sublime, that quantity is more precious, that descriptions of facts are above their meanings and the purpose of why we're describing those facts and not others, well someone who is able to inhabit unconsciously such an upside down, inverted world can put anything at the top of that hierarchy. And I guess the flying spaghetti monster will do.
