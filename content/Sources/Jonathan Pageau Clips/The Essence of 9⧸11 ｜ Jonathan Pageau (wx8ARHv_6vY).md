 All right, so Kevin Patterson asks, hi Jonathan, we've just passed the 19th anniversary of September 11th attacks as an Australian who was too young at the time to comprehend it. I want to understand the symbolism of this event. It involves outsiders taking possession of tech name machines of the sky, large towers of business and trade, religious conflict, conspiracy theory, and people choosing to jump off. What can we unpack here? My goodness, you've said a lot of stuff. Apologies if it's a sensitive topic. The only thing I can say about September 11th in terms of understanding symbolism is that the terrorists attacked the highest thing of American civilization. They attacked the God of American civilization. They attacked the idol, they broke down the idol. And so by attacking the World Trade Center, they attacked the highest thing. American civilization, not just America, but Western civilization has pretty much given themselves to economy. And economy has become the God of our civilization. We think of everything in terms of economy. We make all our decisions in terms of economy. And so I think that that's maybe the best thing to understand there. And that's why they did it in a symbolic act of attacking the most important thing.
