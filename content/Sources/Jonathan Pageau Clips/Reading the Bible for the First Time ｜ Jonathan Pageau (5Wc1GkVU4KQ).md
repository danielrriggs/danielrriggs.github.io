 try to suspend your desire to right away criticize, in the sense that, especially in the Old Testament, like you read the Old Testament stories, if you never had contact with some of those stories, you're gonna flip out, because some of them are wild, like just wild and wild. Just take them into stories, like just read them as stories, and just try to see the connection between things. Try to see how images repeat in different parts of the Bible, different parts of the story. And for sure, I mean, for sure, you should look at what the Church Fathers said. You should look at the different mystagogies that were written by the Church Fathers, which explain to the newly converted Christians what these texts mean, like how they relate to Christ, how they all point to Christ. And so I would say that that is something that can help you. And I mean, ultimately, I would say you should go to church. Like find a church, and the people there will be very happy to help you through. I mean, try to get in contact with people that are in a church nearby. You can kind of gauge them too, and see what's going on in that church. But I would say that being in the community of people who love those stories will help you a lot.
