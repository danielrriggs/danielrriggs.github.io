 In your conception, in what ways is the Antichrist most usually symbolized and where does it lay? Hierarchically relative to Christ presumably at the same strata and what is the most practical relationship? For each of us to have with Antichrist presumably one of informed responsibility Wow Yeah, that's that's really it's very tough that's very tough In what ways is it most usually symbolized a Good way to see Here's a way that I could say it doesn't encompass everything But here's an interesting way that I could say that maybe a lot of people hadn't thought about Which is something like Christianity without Christ Could be a way to see Antichrist there are other ways But if we look at the first Antichrist if we look at Judas we look at the way the Judas Acted in relation to Christ, you know, it's very interesting because Judas betrayed Christ, but there's a scene for example where Judas where Where a you know a sinful woman comes to wash Christ's feet and then Jews it Judas Criticizes Christ for doing that and he says what does he say? He says how could you accept this? We should have we should have given the perfume this very expensive perfume sold it and given the money to the poor and I think that that is a That's that's a nice image of the spirit of Antichrist a kind of Christian values without Christ And you see that right now I think in the the kind of extreme What you call mainline Protestant churches you kind of see this this move towards an obsession with social justice and an obsession with social questions, but a a Turn away from the essential aspect of the church, which is to come into communion in worship before God and also be transformed personally by our Experience of communion and our you know our our interaction within the life of church and is rather turned towards Now I'm not saying of course Christians shouldn't help the poor Of course they should Christ told us we should help the poor this but this is the trick of Antichrist which is to To kind of give us something a kind of Christianity without Christ And so You know What is our What is our most how can we? Be responsible towards that now, okay, let's say this way Antichrist is You know I talk about the double inversion Everybody has heard me talk about that if you're listening to this Tonight you've probably heard this Heard me talk about the Dublin version I think that that's something that can be done with the spirit of Antichrist I think that when we encounter people who talk about Christianity without Christ I think we can flip it back and And bring it back to Christ and so if you've noticed That's what I've been doing Hopefully people can I can only say is for those who have ears to hear All right, okay, so Kevin Martin asks what relationship do you see between
