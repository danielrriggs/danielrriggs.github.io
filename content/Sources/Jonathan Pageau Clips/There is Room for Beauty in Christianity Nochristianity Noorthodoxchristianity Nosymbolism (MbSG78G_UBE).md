 I think a lot of people that struggle with the beauty aspect of the churches are people that look at, let's say, the story of Christ and look at His crucifixion. They look at the poverty of the images in the Gospel. And so they're like, why then do you have these golden temples? And why do you have all this powerful imagery? And the truth is that Orthodox Christianity tends towards fullness, tends to be like a yes and, right? We don't have a no but. It's like yes and. And one of the images that's important in Scripture is the eschatological image. Although Christ, even in His life, the way that He lived very simply and walked, you know, with sandals on the ground, He also presented this vision of the coming of the Son of Man as this glorious finality where all things will come together.
