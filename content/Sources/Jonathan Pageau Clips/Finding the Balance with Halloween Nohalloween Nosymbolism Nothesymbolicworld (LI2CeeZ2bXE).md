 Should we or shouldn't we celebrate Halloween? Is Halloween somewhat dangerous? The answer is of course, yes. All those images of monsters and witches and everything. They are images of death. They are images of all those things that can devour us on the edge. So is it dangerous to engage with that? The answer is yes. What happens if you don't engage with that at all? That is also dangerous. And so I think that each person, especially as Christians, have to find a balance with that. You will have to deal with your demons. This feast of Halloween is a small moment where we can participate in a kind of celebratory way in order for us to see how it works. And then hopefully then we will also know that in the original Halloween, there is the answer which is prayer. And prayer is the answer, the ultimate answer to your demons.
