 I think there's more to it than just a joke here. I think the Olympians in the Greek context, we are the food of the gods. They dine on us. In Homer, in the Iliad, the gods go up when they're having the big battles with Achilles at the end. They're sitting in the trees and they're feasting. They're feasting on human beings. And there's a sense in which they cripple us. They, you know, cutting us in half. They diminish our strength. So who is this human being, Socrates? He's somebody who does attack the gods. The Olympians in the Euthyprope, for example, right? He says, I don't like these stories about Zeus and Cronos and castrations and all these kinds of things. These are not the kinds of deities we should be worshiping. They're not worthy of the name God. Now you get in the Hebrew Bible and in the Christian Bible, God feeds us. We're not food of the gods, God feeds us.
