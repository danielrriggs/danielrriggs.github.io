 And you see it, most people today even, they tend to oppose normally the spiritual and the material, they oppose it. And so either they fall into one or the other, either they want to poo poo the material practice and the material world. You know, like people who say I'm spiritual but not religious, that kind of nonsense. And then on the other hand, you know, we have people who think that this material world is so real, like that's what we need to chase after. But both of those are a mistake. The physical materiality is the bottom part and the most immediate, but ultimately has to move us into... What lies behind it, yeah. And again, what lies behind it is there, even if you want to try to deny it. Like people who live very promiscuously, that does things to your heart and to your soul over time. You can't be intimate with people physically and not also develop intimate connections in other ways. Yeah, like leave some part of your soul with that person.
