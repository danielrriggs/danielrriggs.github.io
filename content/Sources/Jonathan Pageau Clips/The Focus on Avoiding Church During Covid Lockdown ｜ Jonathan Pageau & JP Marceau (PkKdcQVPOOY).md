 And it's interesting because on the flip side of this, like on the flip side of people who want to destroy the cell towers, right when COVID started to hit, and I remember here in Quebec, which used to be the most Catholic place in the world, but is now, you know, one of the probably the most atheistic places in the world, on the radio, on like hit radio, okay, like the most hit radio like that exists. They spent, they kept going over and over how people should not go to church and how people who go to church should not use holy water, that you shouldn't go to communion, all of these things were vectors of transmission, and they were talking solely about that on the radio, and I was like, who are you talking to? Who are you talking to? Because no one does that. Like none of the people listening to your radio station go to church, or very few of them, and so I was like, this is interesting. They're seeing that the church is a place of communion and is still like mythologically in their background thinking, still the place of communion, and so that's the first place they attack when they want us to socially separate. So it was just a very fascinating thing to notice. Yeah. Yeah, that's interesting.
