 You know, we need to remember that Christ is the perfect example of all of this. His ministry was three years long, but his whole life, you know, as a carpenter, was he like carving crosses and giving them to people? You know, probably not. That would have been a weird time. You know, his whole reality would have been offered up to the Father as a prayer. And because he's Christ, he does everything perfectly, which means it's perfectly humble. So when people come to me and they say, I'm thinking about doing this thing or whatever, I'm like, great, do it. And do it as well as you possibly can. Because when you do that, they get a, well, I'll be prideful about it. No, you won't. If it's actually done well, it'll be done in the image of Christ. It'll be perfectly humble. It'll be a great offering. And that's, you know, like Father Chris said, I don't think there's necessarily, it's not a problem. Like Christ doesn't call us to be bankers or artists or lawyers or housewives. He calls bankers and artists and lawyers and housewives to be disciples. That's what he calls. So whatever you do, do it as well as you possibly can. It'll be a good icon. And if it's bad art, it probably stems from bad theology. Get your theology corrected.
