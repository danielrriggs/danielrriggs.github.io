 Can you talk about the symbolism of wings? Are they related to spirit breath since they are always ways to move air? I'm thinking in particular of beasts from Revelation whose wings made a terrifying sound. If I'm on track that would be the symbolism of wings covered with eyes. This is a topic already covered. So yeah, the idea of wings is definitely related to spirit. It's that related to that which is above, that which flies above. And if wings have eyes, then it's also connecting it to meaning, directly connecting it to meaning. So you have this notion of a spirit that has wings and that can see through its wings. And therefore that which is keeping it above you is also that which can see the world and which can identify the world. I like the word identify because it's a word that talks about seeing but also giving meaning to. So yeah, usually in general if you find a story where something has a lot of eyes, it usually has to do with that, has to do with a kind of hyper consciousness or hyper queerness.
