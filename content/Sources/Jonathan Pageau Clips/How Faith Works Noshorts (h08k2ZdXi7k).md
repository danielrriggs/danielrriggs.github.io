 I think Mr. Miyagi in the Karate Kid movie is a great example of symbolic integration, you could call it. And it has to do with this idea of faith, the way that I tried to talk about faith. Mr. Miyagi has him do a bunch of things that don't seem related to each other. And he says, trust me. I say, you do. No question. For now, you're too stupid. You can't see beyond anyways. So just do this stuff and trust me. Have faith. And at some point that faith, well that's what happens in the movie. At some point he gets a revelation where all of a sudden it's revealed to him the reason for all the things he was doing in the first place. And so he jumps one level of integration. That's a great example of understanding how symbolic insight works and how symbolic insight is practical. It's not just something that happens in your mind. It is that kind of jump up when you get insight into how multiplicity fits together.
