 fairy tales, they're very powerful in what they can do. You know, if we forget them or if we try to twist them, then we're also twisting in some ways the fabric of Western civilization. You know, all these folk stories, I like to think of them as tuning forks for civilization. All these stories that people have been telling for centuries, there's an emergent part of it, right? There's all these variations. And then there's a selection part, which is how some versions are remembered through the centuries and they get retold and then they kind of change and get retold. So they get refined like, you know, almost like gold. They're the things you can't forget. That's right. Yeah, and that can't would mean two things. It means you literally can't forget them because they embed themselves in your memory, but also that you forget them at your peril.
