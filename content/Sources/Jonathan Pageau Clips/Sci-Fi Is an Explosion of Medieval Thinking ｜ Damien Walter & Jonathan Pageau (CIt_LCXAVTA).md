 the last two or three years I've been really digging into what we seem to be doing with science fiction because it's like a level of popularity of science fiction movies and now video games as well and we're kind of going into science fiction virtual worlds which I think is interesting to try and explain why are we so fascinated with this symbolism, this kind of symbolic language and what I keep running into and you know I'd be happy to talk a bit more about this as we talk is that science fiction seems to be a kind of symbolic language that keeps drawing on older mythologies and especially religious mythologies and most of all the kind of the Christian mythos and then I've been fascinated with your thinking about the continuing need for a symbolic mythos for our culture and the relationship of that to you know Viveki's meaning crisis and other areas of our sense making kind of conundrum that we're facing at the moment so I'd really just love to kind of dialogue us and see where we overlap with these. Definitely that's I think that the relationship between science fiction and fantasy is very important. I think a lot of people intuitively see them as connected but I think they're connected necessarily you could say almost because there's a relationship between the deep past and the far future it just in the way that we experience reality as spaces that the farther you go back and the farther you go in front the more the coherence breaks down and becomes space for projection becomes like a canvas or something that becomes potential for throwing meaning into you know and so you see that that's why I've been I just wrote an article right now recently about how science fiction especially the idea of aliens and extraterrestrials is a is a cousin is an explosion of medieval thinking it's actually taking medieval thinking of the notion of let's say foreign monsters on the borders of the of the world and the foreign and also the hybrids in the margins of manuscripts and making it into a cosmic manuscript where all these far away galaxies and far away worlds are basically just playing out all these races that you would find in plenty's maps let's say you know all these idiosyncrasies and you know aspects of humanity that are taken to a point and that manifest like a specific aspect so there's I think that it's just the same stuff going on now that was going on in the middle ages it's just it's actually increased in a funny way it's more it's bigger than it was back then but it's the same of the same nature I you
