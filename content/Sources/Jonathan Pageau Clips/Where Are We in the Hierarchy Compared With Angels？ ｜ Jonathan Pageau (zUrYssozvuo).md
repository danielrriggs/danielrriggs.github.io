 So what is the symbolism of the gospel? And why do the angels long to look into it, the gospel? Okay, it was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you, the things that have now been announced to you through those who preached the good news to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, things into which angels long to look into. Well, it's the incarnation, that's what I think, that the angels wish to look onto the incarnation, that is, that this is the mystery, let's say of the incarnation, it's the mystery of also man, which is that by, we are lower than the angels, but the ultimate mystery is that by being filled, as we are filled by the Spirit and as we are, we manifest, let's say the incarnational principle in Christ, sorry guys, then we end up being more than the angels, that we end up actually containing more, it's like, so it's not, so being above is one thing, but filling up the hierarchy is another, so we have bodies, and so the idea of this incarnational principle is that which the angels look down upon and wish, and that's why they had intercourse with women, because they saw the flesh and they desired the flesh, there's something about that which is above which peers into that which is below and desires it or longs for it, and so that's one of the reasons why human beings end up being kind of higher, ultimately higher than the angels or more full than the angels or something like that.
