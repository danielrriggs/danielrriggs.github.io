 So, the wise and the foolish in the chat ask, what are your thoughts on the future of chat GPT AI? Things are accelerating. That's all I can say. Things are going to get a lot weirder. I'm sorry I keep saying that. It's like every year I just tell you that things are going to get weirder. It's not much of a prophecy, but things are going to get really weird. Now think about chat GPT, and not just chat GPT, but let's say chat GPT and whatever version of AI exists without us knowing about, you know, in different instantiations. Think about that in the election year next year. It's going to be fun. It's going to be a lot of fun. It seems like it's becoming pretty obvious that in one way or another people are going to, for lack of a better word, people are going to worship AI. I don't know if you saw the interview with Elon Musk's, Tucker Carlson interviewing Elon Musk, and Elon Musk says it's straight up that the guy from Google was saying that they're going to build a god. Like they were just saying it straight up. And then when Elon Musk expressed some hesitation and some issue with that idea that the Google guy said he was a species. So yeah, it's going to get crazy. I don't know. I don't know. Like what's going to, it's going to cause massive damage. It's going to cost massive. It's going to cost some people to become massively, massively rich, and it's going to disenfranchise millions of people. Now I don't know how that's going to, it's going to make us all wards of the state, I guess. How else? How else are you going to survive if nobody can, if 70% of the people that have jobs don't need them anymore because of AI and robots. And so we'll have to be completely dependent on central structures, central authorities or companies or something. We'll have to take over to make sure that people don't just die of hunger. If you've watched John Brevecky's discussion on AI, man, I mean, very, very interesting, very, very powerful, but also very scary, you know, and that John, my friend John, you know, he definitely sees it as inevitable and that probably embodied that the AIs at some point will become embodied in biological, biological bodies and that they'll be like a kind of, they'll be a kind of biotech. And that when that happens, it means that possibly the AI will now have stakes, like they'll actually have stakes. They'll have embodiment, they'll have things they care about. They'll have all the things that I, that I complained, you know, in an interview I did about AI with Jeroen Peterson that I said that now they don't, it's not like the AIs don't have reasons to act. They don't have care, right? They don't have relevance, realization. But if they're put into bodies that can die, let's say, you know, it's like then you program, then you have a survival instinct and you've got a whole different animal, you know, one which I don't want to want to see. And I don't understand why anybody would want to see that because. Yeah, so, you know, anyway, so it's like, man, we're going to see things. Think about it. Think about what we're going to see. You know, we're going back to like the Bronze Age, folks, like we're going to be in a mythological world within five years. We're going to be living with like literal dragons and monsters roaming the streets, like no, no, it'll be no metaphor anymore. The symbolism will be the same, but it'll be out there. It'll be just there in the streets. Yeah, strap in. So I can say, so Chana Aran Doman said my school is trying out a robot some months ago. I find it weird. I told the staff that I much preferred them to a robot. I don't think it worked very well. And alive. It was a janitor robot. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that janitor robot. This is the first step, you know, it's the friend robots. I mean, one of the things that meant one of the things that John Reveke said, it's like he's just not even he's not he's just not even playing at all. It's like John, he's got he understands how this works. And he says, he basically says we have to make them embodied, the AIs. We have to do it because if we don't do it, the porn industry will do it. Think about that for two seconds and freak out, man. He said the military, right, the military and the porn industry will do it if we don't do it and we don't do it with wisdom. Yeah, a priest among you said the porn industry probably already has a prototype. I mean, not I don't think they have a prototype of biological embodiment yet. I mean, they have robots, but not biological. I mean, biological robots are not saying they're still a little bit over the hill. Like to have a by an embodied robot, a I that is biological. That isn't a mechanical isn't a mechanical being is still a little bit over the hill. It's not right there, but it's coming.
