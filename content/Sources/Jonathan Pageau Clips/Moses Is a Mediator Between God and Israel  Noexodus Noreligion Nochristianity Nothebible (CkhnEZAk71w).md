 So the mountain now appears again as this microcosm. And so you have the animal at the bottom. You have licentiousness, desire, all these things that are at the bottom. And then Moses goes up, and it's as if it's also kind of expressing the problem of disconnecting that's the high and the low. And that's kind of what's happening. Moses is going up, and so because Moses goes up, it's as if things below fall apart. And there's a need for Moses to be that mediator, and that's what he's doing even now as God is saying, I'm just going to destroy these people. He's acting as a representative of the people towards God, and then he's going to go back down and act as a representative of God towards the people. So he really is the mediator between the two principles.
