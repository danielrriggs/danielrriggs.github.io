 we define maturity as leaving home. And of course, that's very problematic for millennials because many of them are still living at home and many of them know that they're not going to have a home. I'll be more careful. They're not gonna have a house. My son is going through that right now. He's living with me. He's working full-time high school biology teacher. That used to be the kind of job that you could build a home and family around. And he's still living with his dad. This is part of it. There's a sort of a double whammy on these kids because first of all, they're not allowed to be homesick because of the cultural thing, but then they can't fulfill the cultural thing because the culture is basically giving them the finger when they try to do it. They're saying, oh, no, no, no. You wanna leave home? Not for you. I'm worried that there's already a powder keg of resentment and then these machines are gonna disenfranchise economically even more people and the resentment is going to become like murderous. Yeah.
