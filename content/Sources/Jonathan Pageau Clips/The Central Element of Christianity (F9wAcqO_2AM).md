 Everything has come now to flow, especially our notion of beauty is so centered around the icon. We kind of are constantly engaged in this relationship of this encounter with a person, this idea that you're looking into a face which is both a mirror of yourself, but is also completely another person. You know, if I look at you, I have this mysterious encounter of communion and God is love. That's really the central element of Christianity, and how all of this connects together, which is this encounter with a person, with persons that reveal how different they are from you, but also reveal how connected they are to you at the same time. It's precisely in an orthodox understanding when we talk about God, we're not really talking about an abstraction, a set of ideas, a set of doctrines, or something like that. It's always grounded. I mean, our notion of salvation that is being changed, becoming whole, becoming fully what we ought to be, is most completely expressed in the phrase of beholding him face to face. You are looking outside yourself, but you're not looking past the human.
