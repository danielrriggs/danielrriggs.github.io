 If you think you're superior to the person that you're in relationship with and talk down to them and not meet their needs and think that you're more important than them, eventually they might surprise you by having an affair or divorcing you, which will cut your economics down, affect your business, distract your mind. So it's wiser to communicate what you value in terms of what they value. And you won't do that if you devalue what they value and you overvalue what you value. So taking the time to see how whatever they're dedicated to is helping you fulfill what you're dedicated to and seeing how what's highest on their value is helping you fulfill what's highest on yours and vice versa. That increases the probability of having a transaction that's sustainable and fair exchange and allows you to have a long-term relationship.
