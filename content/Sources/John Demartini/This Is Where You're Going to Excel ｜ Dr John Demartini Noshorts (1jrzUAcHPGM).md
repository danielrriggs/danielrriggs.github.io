 This will be seven rungs of a ladder, and HV is the highest value and LV is the lowest value, or highest priority, lower priority, most important, least important. This is called the value structure of the individual, or sometimes called the hierarchy of values. Whatever the highest value in your life is, at any moment, it is intrinsic. Now what does that mean? It means that you are spontaneously inspired from within to fulfill it. You have something in your life that you can't wait to get up in the morning, you spontaneously are inspired to do, that requires no outside incentives, no motivation to get you to do. You love doing it. And whatever that highest value is, is where you're going to excel.
