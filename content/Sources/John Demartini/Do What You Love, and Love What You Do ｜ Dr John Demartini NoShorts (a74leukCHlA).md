 So if you want to go and do way more with your life, take whatever's highest on your value and set goals that match it, or take the actions that you would want to do and link it to them. Because if you're not doing what you love and loving what you do and not doing the actions that are most meaningful to you, most fulfilling to you, you're more likely to feel unfulfilled and go into a meeting gratifying behavior, overeating, sloth, not doing anything and sitting there idle. And that's not how you have fulfillment in life. You fulfill your life with, if you'd fill your life with high priority actions that inspire you, that are meaningful, that are linked to your highest values, you'll say, you'll be grateful. You'll have more discipline. You'll have more fulfillment in life. But if not, you'll be more likely to go for meeting gratification, consumerism, or overeating and addictive behaviors.
