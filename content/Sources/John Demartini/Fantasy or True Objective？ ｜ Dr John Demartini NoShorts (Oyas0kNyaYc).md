 Because sometimes people set up fantasies that they think are goals and then get smacked by the things that they were unconscious of because they didn't have a balanced perspective. So the productivity of setting a goal that's more balanced is a higher probability of achievement than a fantasy. And a fantasy is something that's got a positive without a negative. And people want that because an animal is always trying to avoid pain and predator and is always looking for pleasure in prey. And so our animal nature always wants that positive pleasure, but it always gets smacked by the predator. A wise individual, the human that's beyond the animal, is able to see both with objective reason and see things together. Our intuition is always trying to reveal to us the side we're unconscious of that we're ignoring to try to help us see that balance and liberate us from the emotional attachments.
