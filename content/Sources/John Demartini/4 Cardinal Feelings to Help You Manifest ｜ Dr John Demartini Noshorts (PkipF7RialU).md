 Gratitude, love, inspiration, enthusiasm are the four cardinal feelings that allow us to use the law of attraction into manifestation. So if we have gratitude for whatever it is, as it is, without desiring to change ourselves or others relative to it, but just gratitude, our heart opens, our mind becomes clearer, our body becomes enthused, and we act towards that which we intend, and that which we intend acts towards us, and we manifest.
