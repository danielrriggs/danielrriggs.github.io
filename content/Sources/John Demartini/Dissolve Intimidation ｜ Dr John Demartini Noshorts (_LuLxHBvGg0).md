 I also have an exercise in the Breakthrough Experience where we actually take the most powerful people we know on earth in each of the seven areas of life, spiritual, mental, career, financial, family, social and physical, and identify the character traits that we admire most and maybe be intimidated by the most, identify what they are in these people and then find out where we have them in ourselves to the same degree as we see in them. Once we ask where do we have it and what form is it in our lives until we balance that and see that we have it as much as them, when we meet these new people that we think are intimidated they don't, they're not intimidated anymore because we now realize we already have what they have. Only when we subordinate to outside authority do we have that fear and anxiety of fear of loss or something. You can only have those fears when you subordinate to somebody you think has more than you or you have a memory that you thought you had a loss or had a gain. Once that's clear, that's dissolved.
