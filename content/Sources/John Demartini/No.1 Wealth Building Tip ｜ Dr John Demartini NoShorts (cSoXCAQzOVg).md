 The hierarchy of your values dictate your financial destiny. If you have a higher value on buying consumables that depreciate in value, instead of buying assets that appreciate value, then you're going to be working your whole life for money as a slave, instead of having it work for you as a master. So your hierarchy of values are crucial to knowing whether or not you're going to be financially independent. So you have a choice, either calm down the fantasy that you're going to be financially independent and accept that you like to buy immediate gratifying behavior and goods, or have long-term vision and patience and start investing and saving and investing and building your wealth. If you have the highest value, the top three values or top four values, one of them is wealth building, you'll get there. If it's not, you'll keep spending your money on what is highest on your value.
