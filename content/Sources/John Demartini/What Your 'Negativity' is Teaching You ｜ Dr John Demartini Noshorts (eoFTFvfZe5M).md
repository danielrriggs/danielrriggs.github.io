 If I'm angry at somebody else and I have negativity towards others, it's because I'm expecting them to live outside their values, or I'm expecting them to be always one-sided and never both-sided, like all people. So my negativity can give me service if I know how to interpret it, because it's letting me know when I have a delusion and a false expectation of myself or other people, or on the universe.
