 Money was developed for maintaining fair exchange. Money was developed to make sure, if you didn't have money in its form of some sort of currency or trading mechanism, you would end up, somebody would say, well, I make tomatoes, I grow tomatoes. Well, I make chairs. Well, if you don't need a chair, paying somebody with a chair doesn't mean anything to them. Or if you don't need tomatoes, it doesn't mean anything. But if you go and buy the trade your tomatoes in for money and trade your chairs in for money, and then have exchanges based on what the real value of the services is, this is exactly what allowed money to develop. So the reason why money was there is to help people maintain fair exchange, sustainable relationships, and sustainable relationships as part of spirituality.
