 The only time you really give up on something if it's not really important to you. Think of a baby that's getting up or a walk for the first time in his life. If it fell and it says, well, I'm a failure, I fell, that'd be kind of crazy. But what happens to the baby, the baby gets back up and it sees it as feedback. It learns how to balance itself and it becomes successful in walking. Well, when you're doing something that's really, really inspiring to you, you don't give up on it, you just keep going. So you have whatever you think is a setback is actually a feedback to guide you back onto that process.
