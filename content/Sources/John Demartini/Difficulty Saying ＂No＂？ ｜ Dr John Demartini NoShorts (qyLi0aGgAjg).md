 The reason why you say what you say in life is based, every decision you make is based on what you believe will give you the greatest advantage over disadvantage. So if you're having difficulty saying no, it's because in that moment, you're assuming that if you say no, there's going to be more disadvantage than advantage. That's why you did it. But what would happen if all of a sudden you sat down and fought with a preemptive strike, you might say, and thought if that person comes up to me again and asks me to do this again, and asked me to distract me from what is important to me, what if you sat down and wrote down the benefits to them of saying no and the drawbacks to them to saying yes. And you stacked up the drawbacks of saying yes and the benefits of saying no, and kept stacking them up, stacking them up.
