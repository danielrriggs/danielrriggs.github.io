 I went through and made a list of everything that I did in a day, personal and professional. I wrote next to it a column on what does it produce per hour. I wrote next to that a column, what is the level of meaning it has, one to ten. Next to that I wrote down what it would cost to delegate that to somebody else at the same competent level. And then I looked at what I prioritized according to spread. And then I looked at how much time was actually spent. And then I reprioritized the whole thing. And then realized that okay, I'm just going to shed layer by layer until it's all off my plate except the things that I love doing the most. And it didn't take that long to do it.
