 The truth is you don't need to get rid of half of yourself in order to love yourself. True love is embracing both sides of yourself, the things that you like and dislike, instead of having to hold on to the things you like out of righteousness and project the things you dislike onto the opponent. The truth is your opponent is yourself, and when you finally embrace yourself, you love the people.
