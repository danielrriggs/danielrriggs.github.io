 Beliefs are derived from values. So if I set a goal that's aligned with my highest values, and I achieve things, and I walk my talk, and I pursue it, and I achieve it, build momentum and accomplish it, my belief in myself is that I know what to do, I am that person that I'm dedicated to, that's me, that action's me, and I can do it. But if I set a goal that's not in line, because I tend to procrastinate, hesitate, frustrate, don't see, things don't act, I will tend to say, I don't know, I'm not, and I can't. So your belief in yourself is a reflection of how congruent you are. The greater the congruency, the greater the belief in yourself, the greater the certainty of yourself. And people who are certain in themselves become leaders. And people that are uncertain in themselves become followers.
