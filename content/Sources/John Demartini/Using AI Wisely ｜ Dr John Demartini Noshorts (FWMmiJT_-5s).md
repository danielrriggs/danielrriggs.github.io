 If you sit there and get on television or on social media or whatever, and you see somebody touting the end of the world from AI, frankly, I don't pay attention to it. I take half of the information and I know there's the other half. So I go looking for the other half and I keep an inventory of both of them and keep it balanced. Because when people are subjectively biased and skewed and frightened and misinformed and emotional, they're only seeing a subjective biased one-sidedness. They have a confirmation bias on the negatives or the confirmation bias on the pauses and the disconfirmation bias on the pauses or negatives. And they have a skewed view. And if you let that run you, you're going to get emotional and then the world around you is going to run you. And then the misinformation campaigns win. And then whatever their agenda is that they're frightened about in their own incomplete awareness, that's gone out and promulgated as a misinformation campaign. I'm a firm believer that if you balance out your equation, none of that runs you. And you use AI wisely.
