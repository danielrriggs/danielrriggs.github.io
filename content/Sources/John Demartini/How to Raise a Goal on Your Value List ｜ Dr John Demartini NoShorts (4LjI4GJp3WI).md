 Anytime you want to raise a value on your value list, you got to stack up the benefits of that value in your life. If you stack up and how specifically is doing this particular activity going to help me fulfill what's meaningful to me, it'll raise up on the values. If you want to lower values, you stack up the drawbacks. If you stack up benefits to things, it goes up on a value, drawbacks to things, it goes down on a value. So if you say, let's say you go do your value determination and you find out that, Oh my God, fitness isn't on there or wealth building is not on there. Or eating wisely is not on there. And then you go, but I, I have a goal to get fit, but you keep not doing it because you have more important things in your value list to do to ever get around to doing it. Instead of beating yourself up going, why am I sabotaged? Why am I not staying focused on my fitness? You realize it's your values that are doing that. Your hierarchy of values is dictating your destiny.
