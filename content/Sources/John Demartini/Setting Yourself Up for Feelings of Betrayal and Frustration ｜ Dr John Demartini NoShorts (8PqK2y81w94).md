 Everybody who is living has a set of priorities, a set of values, things that are most important in their life. And whatever's highest on that value list, whatever's truly most important is what they're dedicated to. And any time an individual expects somebody with that set of values to live outside that list, they're automatically going to be setting themselves up for feelings of betrayal, frustration, et cetera. And so the myths that many people have, they're just supposed to be like we want, our little fantasy. But we have to learn how to appreciate them for who they are, what they're dedicated to, which is valuable to them, and ask how specifically is what they're dedicated to serving us. Because if not, we're going to want to change them. And nobody wants to be changed, they want to be loved and appreciated for who they are.
