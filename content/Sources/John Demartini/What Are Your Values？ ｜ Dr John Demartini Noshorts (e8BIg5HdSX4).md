 People, if you ask them what their values are, they'll give you social idealisms. Kohlberg, the psychologist said that most people are avoiding pain seeking pleasure or are subordinating to mothers, fathers, preachers, and teachers, or they're subordinating to collective authorities like sheep in a herd of a tradition or convention of a society. Very few people are transcendent and living authentically according to what they really value. If you ask them what their values are, they'll give you a bunch of social idealisms instead of actually what their life demonstrates. I'm not interested in what people say. I'm interested in what they're living. What they exemplify and what they live every single day tells you what they really value. I start from there. That's the foundation you want to build from. That's why values are so important and knowing what you really value, not what you fantasize about.
