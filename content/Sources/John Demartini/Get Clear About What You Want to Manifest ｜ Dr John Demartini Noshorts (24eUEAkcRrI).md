 The entire universe, I believe, is a mind field. It's all of space, time, energy, and matter is really a game of mind. And so whoever has the most powerful mind and the most concentrated mind and most certainty takes the resources of space, time, energy, and matter and concentrates it into the image and into the intention that they hold. So whoever has the most clarity and the most certainty of intention determines and gets the resources. To those who have, more is given. To those who haven't, more is taken away. And the ones who have are the ones that are really clear. And the thing is that we go through our lives and we spend time on almost everything else than the most important, which is being clear about what we're here for and what we want to manifest. And when we do that, it's almost like the universe opens up the doorways for those possibilities.
