 When a country or people in the country feel that they're fulfilling their objectives and achieving their aims and feeling grateful for life, they can handle lots of changes and challenges that go on in their life. They're more resilient and adaptable. But when they're not and they feel that they're not fulfilling what's meaningful or their goals and objectives, whether they're fantasies or real, but when they're not doing it, they get emotional, they get angry. And when they do, they go into their amygdala. And when they get in their amygdala, they start becoming subjectively biased and misinterpret the information around them and react instead of proact.
