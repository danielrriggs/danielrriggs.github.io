 You want to ask yourself, if I'm depressed, what am I comparing my current reality to at that moment? Right at that moment, what am I comparing? What am I expecting? So people say, well, I'm expecting so and so to do this. Okay. Is it in line with their values, their highest values? If it isn't, you have an unrealistic expectation because every decision they make is based on what they believe will give them the greatest advantage or disadvantage at that moment. And if you're expecting them to live outside what they value most, you've got yourself a setback automatically, you're going to have depression. Then if you all of a sudden expect them to be one sided, you expect yourself to be one sided, expect yourself to live outside your values. Look at what you're comparing your life to. What's the fantasy you wish it was being? Because anytime you're expecting it to be other than what it is, you got a fantasy.
