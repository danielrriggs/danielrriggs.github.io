 And the same thing sometimes goes on in a collective society. Even governments do that. They're like an individual. They can get out of their executive function, go into their amygdala, go into subjective bias, get into high polarities, want to be addicted to being right, project your values onto others. Then the other escalation occurs that projects their values back and you get black and white thinking, they're evil, I'm good. They think you're evil and they're good. And all you do is get a battle. And the battle is there as a feedback mechanism to let you know that you're not seeing both sides.
