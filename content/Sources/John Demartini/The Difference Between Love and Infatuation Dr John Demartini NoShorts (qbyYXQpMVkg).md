 Sometimes people confuse infatuation with love. And infatuation is a dopamine stimulus and kephalons and serotonin and oxytocin and vasopressin. It's a set of hormones that come into play that make you, you know, googled-eyed and all infatuated and you start thinking, oh, I want to have babies with this person. I want to have a family and I want to do... It's a procreative energy. And we've confused that with real, what I could call true love. And if a person doesn't know that distinction, they're going to be infatuated and have a crush on the person. And a crush means you're about to be crushed. And I always say that anytime you fear the loss of somebody, you have a degree of infatuation. Anytime you have feelings of love for somebody, you'll feel their presence.
