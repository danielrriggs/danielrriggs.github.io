 The next thing is basically realistic and making sure that it's real. Again, this is something that is not something that's outside in fantasy land, but something that you know is aligned to your values, something that's objective, something you can see a strategy on doing it. Because sometimes people come to me and say, well, that's fantasy. There's no way you can do that. And then as long as you have a strategy on how you can do it, you can do it, even if it's massive goals. So it's not the magnitude so much, is as long as you take that magnificent goal and break it down into small amount of fights that are realistic to obtain step by step by step. It's like the domino effect. If you knock off a little domino, it can knock off a bigger domino, can knock over a bigger domino, and it can get a massive accomplishment with little action steps that build momentum. So you make sure that you do it in a sense that's realistic in that way.
