 Perseverance is one of the greatest achievements. But if you sit there and go, well if it was meant to be, it would be just happened. Well, that means you're addicted to a fantasy that it's supposed to just be easy all the time. And it's not designed to be easy. You have easy and difficulty, support and challenge, positives and negatives in life. When you can embrace both of them equally, you will be freed from the bondage of either one and you'll feel that you can fulfill things regardless of what the outer world dictates.
