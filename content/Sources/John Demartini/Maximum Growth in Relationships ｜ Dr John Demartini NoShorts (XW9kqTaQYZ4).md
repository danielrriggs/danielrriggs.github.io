 Many people think of relationships all supposed to be supportive and all supposed to be positive and all supposed to be happy, but that's fantasy. A relationship will be supportive and challenging if you want to maximally grow. And they're going to do whatever it takes to help you and them fulfill their values. And so you want to make sure that you understand the dynamics of human behavior instead of having a fantasy that you're comparing them to, and then end up being angry at them because they are not matching your fantasy. They're helping you grow. So go in there and look and reflect and own what you see in them and learn the art of communicating what you have as a value in terms of what they have in a value. And you'll turn toxic relationships into tone-ic relationships and you might find yourself loving the person you thought you could never love.
