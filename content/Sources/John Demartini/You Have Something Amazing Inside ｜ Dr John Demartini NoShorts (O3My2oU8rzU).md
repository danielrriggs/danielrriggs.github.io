 I want them to realize that they have something amazing inside themselves and give themselves permission to do something extraordinary on the planet. The magnificence of who they are is far greater than any fantasies they'll impose on themselves. And don't subordinate to the world on the outside. Allow the voice and the vision on the inside to rule and govern the amazing things you can do on the outside. And realize that if you communicate what you would love in terms of what other people love, the world will help you get exactly what you love.
