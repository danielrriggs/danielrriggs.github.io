 No matter what you've done or not done, you're worthy of love. Don't let anybody on the outside tell you you're not magnificent on the inside. Don't let the values of others interfere with your own inspiring, highest values and dreams and prioritize your life on a daily basis. Sit down and write down the highest priority actions you can do today to help you fulfill what's most meaningful to you and stick to the highest priorities. You'll raise your self-worth, you'll accomplish more. You'll be less likely to be burdened. You'll be more resilient and adaptable. So give yourself permission to do something extraordinary on planet earth. The real you is extraordinary.
