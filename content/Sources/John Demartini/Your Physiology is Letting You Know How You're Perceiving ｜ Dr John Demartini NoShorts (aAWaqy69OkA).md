 Your physiology is a feedback mechanism to let you know what you're perceiving. If you're perceiving way more challenge and support, you go into a fight or flight response and you get ready for the defense. If you go in and you perceive more supports and challenge, you go into rest and digestion, anabolic versus catabolic. Your whole physiology is letting you know how you're perceiving.
