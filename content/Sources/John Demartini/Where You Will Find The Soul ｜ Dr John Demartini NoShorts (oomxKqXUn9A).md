 And anytime we repel and reject, we tend to put ourselves up. So anytime we put ourselves up or put ourselves down and exaggerate or minimize ourselves, we're not being ourselves and we're judging and we're conditional. We assume that somebody is supporting or challenging our value structure. So when we actually bring those into equanimity, equilibrium, where they're balanced, we don't judge ourselves relative to others. We don't judge others, others relative to ourselves. We just have an equanimity. We're true in that unconditional state. We have the soul. That's our true being. That's when we're almost authentic. That's where we're loving the state of unconditioned love.
