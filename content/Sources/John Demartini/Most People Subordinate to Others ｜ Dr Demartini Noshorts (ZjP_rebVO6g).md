 Kohlberg, the psychologist said that majority of people avoid pain and seek pleasure, like an animal trying to avoid predator and seek prey. A few people subordinate to mothers and fathers or preachers or teachers. And a great percentage of people subordinate to peer pressure, convention, tradition, and moralities of other people with other values. And few become unborrowed visionaries that step through all of those constainments. And they rise up as transcendent visionaries, unborrowed visionaries, and give themselves permission to create original ideas and original services and products that serve the world. I want you to play there.
