 The soul is your immortal self, if you will, the immortal self, because when you're in the soul, you maximize your influence in your mind. You have noise that's dissolved. See, every time you exaggerate and minimize something and judge something, you've got noise in the brain, static in the brain. The noise to signal ratio, a lot more noise than signal. The signal is the wisdom of the soul. The noise is all the judgments that block it. See, when you infatuate with something and inject their values, you cloud the clarity of your own highest value. When you judge something looking down on them, you also do it, because you're fragmented, you're disintegrated, you're exaggerating and minimizing yourself. You're not being yourself. The moment you do, you end up fracturing yourself. In the ancient Greek philosophy, that was called heterogeneity. When you bring yourself back into balance, you have homogeneity. And there's one versus many, fractured. And there's a law, the law of similars and differences come into balance.
