 So with two people with different values, they are going to have different ideas of what right and wrong, good and bad, pleasureful or painful things are. And this creates sort of a challenge. If you're married, you'll see that the way one wants to raise the family or the children, it may be different than the way the other one, and one will think, well, that's crazy. Well, no, that's crazy. And they'll evaluate each other that way. But in all, if you go to a thousand families, they're all over the place. It's a spectrum of values. In fact, there's a law called the law of heuristic escalation. Whenever a group of people want to promote something, an idealism society, by an ideologue, an equal and opposite group emerges, kind of like a pro-abortion or pro-life and pro and anti-abortion. And you have pro guns and anti guns and pro Democrat and anti Democrat and pro capitalism and anti capitalism and Lord knows how many pairs of opposites.
