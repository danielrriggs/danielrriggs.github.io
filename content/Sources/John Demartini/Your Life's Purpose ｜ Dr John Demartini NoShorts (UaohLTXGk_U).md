 And so your life is constantly demonstrating what you value most. And we sometimes compare ourselves to other people, expect ourselves to be living in somebody else's shoes, and then judging what our life is demonstrating, and then lying to ourselves and clouding the clarity of what our own purpose is, thinking that it should be something else. But what I do is I look at what your life demonstrates every day. If I look at what your life demonstrates every day, the things you spontaneously get up and do that you don't need reminding on, you don't need any outside incentives for, and don't need any motivation for, you just do it. Your life's purpose revolves around that. And sometimes that doesn't match the fantasies you have about how it's supposed to be.
