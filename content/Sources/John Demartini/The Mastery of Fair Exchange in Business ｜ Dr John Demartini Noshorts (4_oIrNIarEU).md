 If we're in business, which we all are in some form, if we look down on people and we don't care about their needs, we don't fulfill those highest values that they live by, we don't have a source of income. And if we look up to people, we'll sacrifice in negotiation to be with them and give away our profits. But if we have equity, equity between ourselves and others and equanimity within our own being, we have the mastery of fair exchange, which is sustainable in that sustainable fair exchange reality. We also because of that equanimity, we live most authentically and we live actually the most inspired path we can doing what is our service that we love to do, caring about another human being to try to help them fulfill theirs.
