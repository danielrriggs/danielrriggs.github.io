 It's never what happens to you, it's how you perceive it. And if you can perceive it in a way where it's on the way, not in the way, the very thing that you once initiated a phobia and a fear over can all of a sudden turn into a failure opportunity. And so finding out how it served you can liberate you from that anxiety, because there's nothing in life that doesn't have a way of helping us.
