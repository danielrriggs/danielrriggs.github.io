 Any area of your life you don't empower, somebody's going to overpower. And I assure you, nobody's dedicated to your fulfillment, but you. So if you're not taking command, if you're not empowering all those areas, you're going to subordinate to the people on the outside. And people who subordinate to the people on the outside, they have a clouded mission in life. They're not inspired by their life. They're sitting there unfulfilled and they usually go and become consumers of other people's brands instead of building their own brand. They look for immediate gratification and addictive behaviors instead of a meaningful life.
