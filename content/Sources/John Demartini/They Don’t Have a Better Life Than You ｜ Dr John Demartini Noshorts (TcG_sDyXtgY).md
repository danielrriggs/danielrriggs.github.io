 Be careful of going and comparing yourself to other people's lives. That really screws things up. You compare yourself, they think they have a better life over there and go, Oh man, look at my life. It sucks. No, they don't have a better life. They have a different life. They have a different set of pains and pleasures, a different set of challenges and supports and a different set of, you know, things that they like and dislike. So don't compare yourself to other people so much. Compare your daily actions to what you value most. So you're doing something meaningful and keep asking, how can I serve ever greater numbers of people doing what I really love to do?
