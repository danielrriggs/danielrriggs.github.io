 If somebody needs to be motivated from the outside to do something, it's not what's most meaningful to them. Nobody has to get me up in the morning to do my research or to do my teachings. I haven't needed motivation for doing those things in 44 years. So if you are really setting goals that are really truly yours or taking actions that are really congruent, you spontaneously are inspired from within. You have an intrinsic drive to do it. If you require outside incentives to do it, it must not be the highest value. You may think it is, but it's not. And many people fool themselves into saying, well, I really, really want to save my money and get wealthy. But they keep buying things that are higher on their values, which are media gratifying consumables. So I don't go by what people say. I go by what they live and their life demonstrates their values. And so when you are setting goals that are congruent, you will be inspired to get up and go do it, whatever it may be.
