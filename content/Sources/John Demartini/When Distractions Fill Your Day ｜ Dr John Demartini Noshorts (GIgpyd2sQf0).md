 In all probability throughout your life, either at work or in general experiences, you've noticed that if you don't fill your day with very, very high priority, most important actions, and kind of tick them off like an agenda, your day tends to fill up with low priority distractions and unexpected things. When people have a very strong, high prioritized agenda, it's easy to say no to distractions, easy to say no to opportunists, easy to say no to things around them that try to vie for attention. You're more likely to be distracted if you don't have an agenda sitting out there that's filled for the day. There's a law in business called Parkinson's Law that whatever time is allotted, the work tends to fill. So if you don't really cluster book your actions and fill your day with really high priority things and fill it, it will get infiltrated by things that will distract it.
