 Deep inside almost every child is a part that wants to love the parents. And deep inside of the parents is a part that wants to love the child. But sometimes we don't know the skills or we don't know how to communicate and we get self righteous with our amygdala and expect others to live in our values. We have unrealistic expectations and we don't know how to communicate effectively. So we go to gesture. And if we don't get gesture doing it, we eventually get to aggression and we end up doing outrageous things with people because we haven't governed ourselves. And that's primarily because we haven't asked the question is to see the hidden order in the parent chaos. And once we do, we realize that the childhood we had was not an imperfection, but it was actually giving us the exact ingredients needed to do something extraordinary with our life.
