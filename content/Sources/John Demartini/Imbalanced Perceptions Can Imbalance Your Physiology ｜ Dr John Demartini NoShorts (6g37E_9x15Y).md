 Each individual has a set of values, a set of priorities they live their life by, things that are most important to least important in life. Whenever they perceive that their values are supported, their parasympathetic nervous system comes online. And whenever they perceive that their values are challenged, their sympathetic nervous system comes online. And these are complementary opposite expressions of the nervous system that keep our physiology in check and balanced. So whenever we have an imbalanced perception, we can imbalance our physiology, and we create symptoms.
