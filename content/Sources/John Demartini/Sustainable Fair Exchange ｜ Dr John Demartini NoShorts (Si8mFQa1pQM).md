 In that centered state, when we're not exaggerating ourselves or minimize ourselves, we have the highest probability of actually having fair exchange with people. We have a state of equanimity and we have a state of equity between ourselves and others. If we puff ourselves up, we tend to look at people and look down at them. If we minimize ourselves, we tend to look up to people. When we exaggerate ourselves, we tend to go narcissistic. We think people owe us. We minimize ourselves, we tend to go altruistic. We tend to think we need to owe them. When we center ourselves, we look for sustainable fair exchange.
