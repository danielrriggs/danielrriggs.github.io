 Set goals that are basically specific to the highest values, that are basically measurable and metric. So you make sure you're making progress on it, make sure that they're aligned and attainable and make sure that they're actually realistic and something that you won't forget, you'll remember them, and something that is realistically timed and done in a situation where you have an urgency to go and act. At the end of that push that you have, you'll end up saying, thank you. And it feels great when you get a lot done in a short period of time. Anytime you're doing the highest priority actions in a day, your self-worth goes up and you want to go and accomplish more, set more goals and bigger goals, expand the time horizon. And anytime you're doing lower priority things, you do just the opposite, you shrink. So if you want to expand and do something magnificent instead of shrink and do something insignificant, prioritize your goals, make sure that they're aligned with your highest values and be smart.
