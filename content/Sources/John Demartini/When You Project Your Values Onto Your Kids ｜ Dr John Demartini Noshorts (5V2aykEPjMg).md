 If you expect and project your values onto them and expect them to excel and do things that aren't highest on their values, just know, you're probably going to falsely label them. You're going to probably think, well they're unmotivated or they're not confident or they're not driven or they're this. And you typically put labels on people whenever you project a value onto somebody that's not highest on their value. You can rely on your boy or girl to be doing or whatever gender it is, you can, you can rely on them to live according to their values. The higher their values dictates their destiny and determines how they perceive, decide and act. And if you expect them to do something outside, what their highest value is, you can pretty well guarantee they're going to betray you because they're not going to get around to doing something that's important to you necessarily, unless it's important to them. So finding out what their highest value is, is the first step.
