 The more I've probed into the mysteries of nature and of human behavior and of the cosmology of the universe, I am the more I come to an appreciation and humble myself to an intelligence that somehow governs the order behind it. Even the things that we think are chaotic ultimately have a hidden order behind it. Scientists and great theologians and writers and researchers would never have probed and stayed long-term focusing on the answers to the mysteries of the universe. If they had not felt somehow that there's an underlying rationale, they've never probed that far, never kept their mission alive. If they didn't believe somehow in a rational system. So I tend to believe that there is a hidden order in the things that we think are apparent chaos.
