 You want to basically ask how specifically is whatever I'm doing on a daily basis, help me fulfill my highest values. And if any way you can delegate something that's not highest in priority, delegate it and keep to high priority. But if you can't delegate it yet, link what you're doing to your highest values, clarify what your vision is. Make sure you can see in your mind's eye that goals that you're striving for and shooting for, if you do, your energy levels go up.
