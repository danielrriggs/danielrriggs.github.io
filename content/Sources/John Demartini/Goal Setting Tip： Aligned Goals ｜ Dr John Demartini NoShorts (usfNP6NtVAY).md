 The old adage about being smart, that's specific and measurable and attainable and realistic and timely, it's all accurate. But you want to make sure more than anything is to make sure that the goals are truly aligned to your highest value. Make sure the goals are yours. Subordinating to people on the outside and injecting expectations, goals and values from others that are not truly aligned to yours can make you set yourself up for what I call the self depreciation response. You end up beating yourself up because you don't really have an intrinsic calling to act on it. And you're trying to go after a goal that's not as meaningful as you like to fantasize. This is not the way you achieve the greatness that you deserve. It's by identifying what's truly most important to you and stick to your core competence and start with what you know and let what you know grow in achieving. And if you do, you'll build momentum and your core competence will expand and you'll be capable of doing even more with your goals.
