 No two people will ever have the same values. And in the world, demonstrated by the law of heuristic escalation, there will always be somebody with a complete opposite set of values in the world who want to destroy what you want to build, that don't want to learn what you want to learn. You'll see this in your family dynamic. You'll see this in your social dynamic at work. You'll see it across society. It's a known dynamic. Because we're entangled with our opposite in the universe. And what we want to build, somebody else wants to destroy and vice versa. What we want to know is somebody doesn't care about knowing. There's always a pair of opposites to keep the universe remodeling for an evolving universe so we are evolving in life.
