 It is never what happens to you that matters. It's how you perceive it, what decision you make out of it, and how you act from it. William James, the father of psychology, said the greatest realization in his generation was that human beings can alter their lives by altering their perceptions and attitudes of mind. No matter what happens to your life, whether supportive or challenging, you want to master the art of taking the challenging events and asking, how are they helping me fulfill my mission? How are those events helping me on my goals? Because the very thing you think is challenging, a day, a week, a month, a year, or five years later, you will discover was exactly what you needed on the step to your journey.
