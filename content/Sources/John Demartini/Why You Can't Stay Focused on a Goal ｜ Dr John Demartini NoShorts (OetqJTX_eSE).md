 You sit down and you ask a simple question. You first determine what your values are. You discover now that, oh my God, fitness isn't in there, or weight management's not in there, or eating wise is not in there. And you go, oh great, I thought it was. And I've been beating myself up thinking, why can't I stay focused on these things? It's because you keep having things more valuable to you interfere with it. And you're going to make decisions based on what you value most.
