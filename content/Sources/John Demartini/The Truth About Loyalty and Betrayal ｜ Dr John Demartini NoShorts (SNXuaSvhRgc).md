 So anytime you expect from any other human being something that matches their highest values, you're probably going to have a person that you're going to end up labeling loyal. And anytime you expect somebody to do something that's low on their values, maybe high on yours, but low on theirs, you're going to feel that you got betrayed because they're not likely to do it. They're going to forget about it. They're not going to get around to doing it. They're going to let you down on it.
