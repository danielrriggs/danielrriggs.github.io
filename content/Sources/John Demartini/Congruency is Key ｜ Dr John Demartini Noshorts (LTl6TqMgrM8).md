 It's not just a kind of a fantasy in the future, it's a feeling of presence. When you actually write something that is congruent, you feel it's impossible for you not to do. You feel it's destined, you feel it's already in motion, you feel that it's congruent with what you're already living and you just feel it's impossible not to manifest. And so it's not just always, this is what I wanna do in the future, it's like this is what I wanna continue to momentum build throughout my life.
