 when you're paying off debt, if you're resenting the debt, it's harder to pay. They found out that people that are divorced and somebody takes the children and the other one's paying child support, if that individual paying child support is resenting the person that they're paying the debt to, they're more likely not to pay the child support. And it's more harder for them to make the money to pay it. They have an unconscious motive not to. The same for you. Whenever you have debt that you've already incurred, it's wise to write down all of the benefits you've received on it. So you can be grateful for it. If nothing else, the lessons it taught you about managing money, but write down the benefit because if you're grateful for what you have the debt for, you're more easily able to pay the debt off. You're not resisting it. Cause if you resent the debt, it's hard to pay. Nobody wants to pay for something they resent. So be grateful for the debt you've got, learn the lesson not to continue to get further into debt and make sure that you, unless it's debt, that's going to make you more money.
