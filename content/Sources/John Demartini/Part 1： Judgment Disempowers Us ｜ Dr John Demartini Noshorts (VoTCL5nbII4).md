 The truth is you have everything. You're both hero and villain. You're both saints and sinner. You have both vice and virtue. So putting people up or down instead of putting them in your heart is a disempowering act. So judgment disempowers us and allows us to get to the Peter principle of incompetency, of managing our perceptions and actions in life. So by using the law of the one to many, you're going in there and you're owning the parts, whatever you perceive in them. I ask people, go to a moment where and when you perceive yourself displaying or demonstrating the specific trait, action or inaction you perceive in them, displayed and demonstrated by them within yourself and identify where it was and when it was and who you've demonstrated to and who perceived you that way and own all the parts. Then you level the playing field. You're not above or below people. You have now equanimity and objectivity.
