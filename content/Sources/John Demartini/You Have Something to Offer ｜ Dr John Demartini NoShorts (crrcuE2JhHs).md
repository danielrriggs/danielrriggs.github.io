 Anytime you see somebody that you think has something more than you, it's wise to ask yourself, where and when do you just demonstrate and display and have this trait, this action, this behavior that you see in them to the same degree? Where do you have wealth in your life, in the seven areas of your life, if it's not in cash, where do you have what they have? Because the second you level the playing fields and own the traits of these people you envy, you won't be jealous. You won't be jealous of the person. If you know you have something equally valued to the person that's now potentially drawing your attention and you know for certain you have it, you don't feel jealous. You realize that you have something to offer. And if that person's not recognizing it, if they off with somebody else, you're not fighting or losing them. You only fear the loss of things you infatuate with.
