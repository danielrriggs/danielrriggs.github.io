 Jealousy could be a reminder and a catalyst for you to empower your life. It doesn't have to be a bad thing. Many people say, well, I've got jealousy, I'm jealous of this person, anything else, but it actually could be a reminder to catalyze growth in your life. So if you see somebody that you look up to and you admire and you envy, and you wish you had what they had, well, the wisest thing to do is to ask yourself where and when do you display or demonstrate or have what you perceive them having.
