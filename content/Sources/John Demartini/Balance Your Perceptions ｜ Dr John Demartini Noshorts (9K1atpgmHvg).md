 If a person is in an anxiety or phobia, they're lying about the universe usually because of events in the past that they thought were painful that they never found the pleasure to. They thought it was a loss and never found the gain to. They thought it was a pain they never found the pleasure to. If they see a negative without a positive, they see that they're going to keep living with that anxiety. So what I do in the Breakthrough Experience, I go back to those moments when they've had those experience, itemize those moments when they had a loss and find out where the gains were, where they had a pain, where the pleasures were, where they had a rejection, where were the acceptances, where they had a fear of loss, what were the gains, and neutralize those memories. If those memories are neutralized and there's no evidence of it ever being imbalanced, then they'll step out with more courage into the future.
