 It's like we're looking for the next thing we haven't loved to give us an opportunity to experience love again. So we're going through a journey process of having love and then judgment and then love and then judgment, love and judgment as we evolve. And every time we go beyond a judgment, we're in a greater state of love, we start a new judgment, a greater love, better judgment, things we haven't learned, our new mystery. And then we make that history by loving it and we go into our next mystery and learn to love that. So we're growing in our appreciation and love for what the universe set up. They didn't order it, but we first initially kind of react and judge things only to discover that we haven't seen what's actually there.
