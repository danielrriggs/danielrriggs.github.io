 If you care about humanity first and meet the needs of people, not sacrificing yourself, not minimizing yourself, not this altruistic sacrifice of self for others, but care about people enough to meet their needs, there's no lack of meet people's needs. And there's no lack of income. There's absolutely zero lack of income to anybody who cares enough to go out and meet people's needs. And that is the starting point. It has to start there. Now, if you find what needs are and you find out what you also are inspired by and you find those where they overlap, you've got your niche. That means you can't wait to get up in the morning and deliver that service.
