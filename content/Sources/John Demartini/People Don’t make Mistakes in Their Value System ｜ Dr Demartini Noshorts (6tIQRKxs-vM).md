 Anytime we're proud and looking down on somebody and projecting our values onto them and expect them to live in our values, we're setting ourselves up for betrayal. We're setting ourselves for thinking they keep making a mistake and they're wrong and we need to fix them and change them and get them to be more like the way we want. And this is an illusion. They're not actually making mistakes in their value system. They're making an assessment and making a decision based on their values in that moment with the information that they've got. And in their value system, it's not a mistake. They're making a decision based on what they're perceiving, but in our perception and our values, we may label them a mistake.
