 Leaders must learn to prioritize what they do and fill their day with high priority actions that inspire them. Otherwise, their life will fill up with low priority distractions that don't. They need to delegate lower priority actions that devalue them and get onto the things that truly serve the most, that has the most meaning, that most inspiring. So they can't wait to get up in the morning and serve. So people can't wait to get that service. When they do, it's spontaneous. It's you cannot stop the evolution and expansion and incremental exemplification of power that you have as a leader when you do that.
