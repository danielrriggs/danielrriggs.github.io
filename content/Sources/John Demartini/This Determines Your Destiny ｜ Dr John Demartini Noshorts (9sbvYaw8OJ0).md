 Each individual has a set of values, and whatever is highest on their value tend to bring discipline and order to, and whatever is lowest on their value, they tend to be dissipated and then procrastinate and hesitate and chaos. Whatever is on their inner most dominant thought is a reflection of whatever their highest value is. Example, if your highest value is having children and raising a family, and if you walk in a mall, you will see everything to do with raising a family and what to do with children. If your highest value is business and finance, you walk in a mall, you'll see business and computers and things in bookstores. And there's whatever your inner most dominant thought is, is a reflection of the highest values in your life. So you literally draw into your life and notice things in your life and act upon things in your life exactly proportionate to the hierarchy of your values. Your hierarchy of your values dictates your destiny, because the hierarchy of your values determines your inner most dominant thought, which determines your outer most potential reality.
