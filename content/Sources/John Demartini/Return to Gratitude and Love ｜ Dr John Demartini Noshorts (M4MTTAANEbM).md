 No matter what happens to your life, all events have a pair of opposites. They're always balanced. If you choose to see more positive than negatives and become infatuated, it will consume you. If you see more negatives than positives and become resentful, it will consume you. But if you learn to ask questions that balances your perceptions, you will dissolve your emotions and liberate you from the bondage of those misperceptions and return you to gratitude and love, which allows you to be inspired again. So it's not what happens to you, it's your perception of what happens, and you always have command over your perceptions. May you empower your life with that.
