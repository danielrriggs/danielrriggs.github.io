 If you want to make a difference in yourself, you need a vision at least as big as your family. If you want to make leadership in the family you need a vision as big as your community. If you want to be a leader in your community, you need a vision as big as your city. If you want to be number one in the city, you need a vision big as your state. If you want to be number one in the state, you need a vision as big as your nation. If you want to be leader in the nation, you have to have a global vision. And if you want to truly make a global impact and leave an immortal legacy on the planet, you need an astronomical vision. And our highest priorities lead us to expand our space and time horizons until we have astronomical visions.
