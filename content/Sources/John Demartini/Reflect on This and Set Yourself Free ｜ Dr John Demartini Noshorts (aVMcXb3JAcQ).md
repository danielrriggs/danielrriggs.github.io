 All I can say is that if we take the time to equilibrate our mind and ask the questions to help us see both sides, we don't have to be victims of history. We can be masters of destiny. So right this minute, if you stop and look at the things you thought were terrible in your life, if you look carefully enough, you can find out how it served you. It either developed a skill or it helped you strengthen something or helped you in some way. If you don't see it, well, you'll run the story and stay in a victim of your history and you can store it in your subconscious mind and you'll be frightened of things that associate with it and looking for its opposite, you'll be extrinsically run by events that you've chosen to see only one side to. But if you take the time to see both sides and balance the equation, you set yourself free and then you're not run from external stimuli, you're run from within. And then the voice and the vision on the inside is louder than the perceptions on the outside.
