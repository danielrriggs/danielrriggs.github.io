 Maximum growth and development occurs at the border of support and challenge. We grow there most. We're most resilient and adaptable there. But when we're living by lower values, as a result of subordinating to everybody else's expectations and trying to please everybody instead of serve people, we automatically have unfulfillment and go towards a hedonistic approach. This hedonistic approach makes us addicted to praise, addicted to support, addicted to pleasure, impulsive for pleasure, searching for consumerism, living vicariously by associating with other people off their brands instead of building our own brand. As a result of it, we're frightened of criticism. We're frightened of rejection. We're frightened of not fitting in. And we become part of the herd, a sheep, not a shepherd.
