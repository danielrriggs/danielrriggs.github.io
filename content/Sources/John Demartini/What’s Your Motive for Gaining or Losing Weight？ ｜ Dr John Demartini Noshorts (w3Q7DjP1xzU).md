 The question is, is what is the motive? So if you've never asked that, you might want to discover what that is. And because sometimes we have subconsciously stored baggage from previous experiences, and then we find out that it's impacting our future actions and why we're gaining or losing weight drastically. And I think that it's wise for us to be able to ask those questions. So don't be afraid to ask yourself, what's really the motive, why you've gained or lost weight. You might discover something pretty profound about yourself. And usually the ones that bring a tear of gratitude are the ones that are the big ones. And I ask people, when I see people that have gained or lost a drastic weight, you know, significantly, I look for the motive.
