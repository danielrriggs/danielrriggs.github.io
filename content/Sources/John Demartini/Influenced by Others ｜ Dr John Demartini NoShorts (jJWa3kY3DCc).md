 Many people come to me who are playing the victim role and want to dissociate their own cause from their own effect. And so what happens, they think that something on the outside is actually influencing them instead of their perceptions of the outside. And so what I find is that the only way another person can actually influence you is if for some reason you disempowered yourself and are not clear in your own intentions.
