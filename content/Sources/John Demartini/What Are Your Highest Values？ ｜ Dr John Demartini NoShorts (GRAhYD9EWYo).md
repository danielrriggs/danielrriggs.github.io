 When you ask people what their values are, they will very commonly say social idealisms and say what they think it should be or ought to be or supposed to be or fantasize about what they wish it would be. This is not the secret. The secret is to actually identify what truly your life demonstrates is most important and valuable to you. Because once you identify what your life demonstrates, not what you fantasize, but what your life demonstrates, you have the keys to setting goals and intentions and attentions that are congruent, that are aligned and to help you master your life. The second you set goals that are based on what's truly most important to you, truly inspiring from within, you don't need motivation from without. You don't need to be reminded from without to do what really is meaningful to you.
