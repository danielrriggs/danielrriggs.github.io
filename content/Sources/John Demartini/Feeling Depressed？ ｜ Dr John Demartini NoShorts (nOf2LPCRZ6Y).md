 So if you're in a situation where you're feeling depressed, ask, what are you comparing your current reality to? And then make sure that that's real and not polarized and unreal in expectations. Once you do, reset the expectations, ground them according to what's real, not your bias, not what the fantasies, not the social idealisms, or sometimes those are delusions, but what's real for the person. If you do, your depressions will subside automatically.
