 We don't have to be victims of our history. We can be masters of our destiny by taking command of our perceptions. It is not what happens to it. It's our perception, decisions and actions that we do from it. And that we have command over. We have command over our perceptions, our decisions and our actions. We can make a mountain out of a molehill or a mole out of a mountain. We can make one hell into opportunity if we take the time to find out how it serves us. One of the greatest questions we'll ever ask on a daily basis is how's whatever I'm experiencing today helping me fulfill what's most meaningful to me today. If you ask that question and never give up on that question and answer it, you liberate yourself from a lot of baggage and anxieties and depressions can be melted away.
