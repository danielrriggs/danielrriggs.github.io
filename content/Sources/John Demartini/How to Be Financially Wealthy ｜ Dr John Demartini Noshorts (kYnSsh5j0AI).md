 When somebody says that no matter what I do, I can't seem to get ahead financially, but I really want to be financially wealthy. They keep spending their money on clothes and keep spending money on immediately gratifying consumables and depreciables and on going on trips and paying things. They don't have any focus on putting it into investments and an asset that goes up in value. It puts money in their pockets instead of taking it out of their pocket. Then they really don't want to be wealthy. They want to live those things that they keep doing. Until they get that realization and realize that they're living in their fantasy and creating their nightmare, then they're going to bang their head against the wall until they finally get that.
