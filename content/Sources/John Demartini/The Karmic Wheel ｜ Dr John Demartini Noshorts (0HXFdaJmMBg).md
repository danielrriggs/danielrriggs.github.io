 The karmic wheel is all of those judgments. So anytime you judge others or judge yourself and exaggerate or minimize them or you, you automatically have this idea of a false causality because when you exaggerate yourself, you'll feel proud and you assume that you did something more positive than negative. When you're ashamed, you think you did more negative than positive to someone. When you admire and fatuous with them, you think they did more positive negative to somebody, you. And when you resent somebody, you think that they did more negative than positives to you. Anytime you have a judgment and you have an imbalanced ratio of perceptions and you have a polarization and you have a valency as they call it in chemistry and it's charged positively or negatively and you're judging and you think you're too good or too bad relative to somebody else or they're too bad or too good relative to you and deflective awareness, that's the so-called karmic wheel. And that does run your impact your life. It just keeps regurgitating in the brain until you finally bring it back to balance.
