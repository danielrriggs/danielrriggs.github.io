 If we exaggerate ourselves and get narcissistic and look down on people and then project our values onto people and expect them to buy what we have, eventually they are not interested. They don't feel that it's win-win for them. And they ask what's in it for them and they aren't getting anything and they don't buy. So we don't have any income. If we minimize ourselves, we tend to altruistically sacrifice our profits and give deals away in order to get the deal because we're minimizing ourselves to people. But if we are basically being ourselves and we're having equity between other people, we care about ourselves. We care about them. And we make sure we have a win-win fair exchange relationship.
