 The moment you subordinate to somebody else and think they have something and exaggerate them and minimize you, you're going to have the anxiety about speaking. But the second you realize that whatever you see in your audience, you have in your own form, you liberate that anxiety. And so preparing for the class, for the presentation, making sure it's in the core competence, owning the traits of the people that you may be intimidated by. And some of those are just your own illusions because they may not even be that educated, they may just look the part. And owning that will make you not have so much anxiety about it because the anxiety of speaking is primarily because of subordination thinking that they know more than you and you're worrying about their opinion. You're giving power to their opinion over you instead of your own.
