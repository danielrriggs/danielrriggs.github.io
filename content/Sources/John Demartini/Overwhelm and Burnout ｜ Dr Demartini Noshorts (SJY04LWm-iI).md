 Anytime you infatuate with somebody and put them up on a pedestal in any of the areas of life, spiritual, mental, career, financial, family, social or physical, and you don't level the playing field and you envy them and try to imitate them, you inject their values, you cloud your mind with all these expectations, shoulds, ought to, supposed to, got to, have to, must, need to, and then you end up feeling like overwhelmed and burned out because you're trying to do something that's not really the most important or inspiring thing that you spontaneously love to do. When you're doing what's highest on your priorities, you don't burn out.
