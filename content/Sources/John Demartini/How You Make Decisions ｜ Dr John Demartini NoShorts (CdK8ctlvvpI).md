 When the Y is big enough, the hows will take care of themselves. Because you make decisions based on what you believe will give the greatest advantage over disadvantage. So if you stack up enough reason for doing something, you'll do it. So don't stop stacking up enough benefits of doing what it is you know is wise to do, until you see a change in behavior. When you do that, you know you've got enough and then you can keep going further if you want.
