 If you're not filling your day with high priority things that are very meaningful, your life will fill up with low priority distractions that don't. If you're not filling your day with high priority things that inspire you, that challenge you, that you want to tackle something meaningful, then you're going to go into your amygdala and your amygdala is going to want to avoid a pain and seek a pleasure. And it's going to keep going to things that are consciously or unconsciously pleasureful. And so I don't go by what people say. I go by what their actions are. Their actions speak louder than their words. And when they say, I need to stop this behavior, I go, well, great. As long as you have more advantage and disadvantage, consciously unconsciously in doing it, you're not going to.
