 What does wealth mean to you? You know, there's many forms of wealth and all the years I've been teaching, I've been watching different expressions of wealth in people's lives. For instance, you could have financial wealth where you actually have assets that you've accumulated and it's working and passive income is coming from it. That's one form of wealth, but you could also have wealth in the form of intellectual property. You could have it in beautiful children and family. You could have wealth in the form of social connections or spiritual awareness or possibly physical fitness and physique and beauty. You could have it possibly in the form of a business, just purely a business.
