 I found out people that think they're altruists have a hidden agenda and they may not admit it, but it's unconscious, but it's there and I can uncover it and show it and reveal it. It's either compensation for guilt of the past or a hidden agenda of the future. And just like narcissism, it's compensation for the past, pride of the past and a hidden agenda, philanthropic agenda. So don't be fooled by facades. Look carefully for both sides, find both sides and learn to love people and realize that whatever we judge in others, we have within ourselves. Find it in yourself. Go to the moment, where and when you perceive yourself displaying or demonstrating the same thing you perceive in them. And you'll find out that the fingers out there are pointing back at you and you're also doing the same. And you have both sides, just like they do. When you can see that in you and you can see that in them, you liberate yourself from a lot of burden and you also learn how to manage the state. Because when you love people for who they are, they turn into who you love.
