 Anytime you inject the values of other people into your life and try to be somebody or not, as Emerson said, envy is ignorance and imitation is suicide. You cloud the clarity of your own mission and you hold back your greatest creativity. And when you're you and you're original, you're automatically going to cause a new paradigm shift. You're going to get rejected because everybody's going to project onto their values and try to get you to fit whatever will support their values. So you're going to start now being an unborrowed visionary. You're going to end up beating a different drum. You're going to end up stirring up some things. But as a result of that, original new ideas are going to come in as a paradigm to change the world. And I say, just give yourself permission to do something extraordinary on planet earth and give yourself permission to be the most authentic you, because that's the most powerful you you can ever be.
