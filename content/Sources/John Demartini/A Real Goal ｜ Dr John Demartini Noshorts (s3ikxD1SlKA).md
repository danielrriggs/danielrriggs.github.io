 A real goal is an objective goal that has both the positives and the negatives forethoughted. And a fantasy is one that only has the positives without the negatives, and then you have negative self-talk coming in to try to balance it out for yourself. But if you're addicted to a fantasy and living in lower values, you'll buy into the positive thinking mentality that think I just want to do this and cancel out the negative thoughts, get rid of those negative thoughts. But the negative thoughts of your friend, they're making sure that you don't go after a fantasy that's not obtainable, that you're setting a goal that's got mitigated risks with forethought and planning. So the purpose of strategic planning for an objective is to make sure that you have both sides in your goal. Or otherwise the elation of the pursuit will automatically create the anxiety to try to make sure that you ground yourself from a fantasy.
