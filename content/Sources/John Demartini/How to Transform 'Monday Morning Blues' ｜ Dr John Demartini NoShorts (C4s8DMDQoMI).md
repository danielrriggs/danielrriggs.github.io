 The key is to make sure you asked how specifically is doing this action helping you fulfill what it is that you really would love to do in life. And if you can link those and answer that question 10, 20, 30 times, you'll actually be appreciative of the job you have right now, temporarily, on the journey to unfold the one that you want to build. But if you don't ever put a plan together, don't have a strategy, and don't put something that serves people that actually goes and makes income, you'll be in this job for the rest of your life, until you find something that gives you more income, because you're not going to run away from your security, if you've got all these responsibilities, you're going to want to upgrade and make more income doing something you love to do. And I've yet to see somebody that can't do that, but I've seen some people that come up with excuses why they haven't done it.
