 When we are infatuated with something, we're conscious of the things that support it values and the unconscious of things that challenge it. When we're resentful to something, we're conscious of the things that we're challenging or values and unconscious things of support it. So we split our conscious and unconscious, our full consciousness into unconscious and conscious the moment we judge. And then we integrate the conscious and unconscious into full consciousness the moment we love.
