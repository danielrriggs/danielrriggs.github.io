 Jealousy on the other hand is now you are having somebody or yourself jealous of somebody because you're afraid that somebody could take away something you want. Let's get an example. Let's say you are dating a guy or a gal that you are infatuated with and you, you wish you could be a hold on to them. You're, you're, you're afraid of losing them. And now you see somebody that you think has something you don't and they could draw the attention to the person that you want to have your relationship with. And they spot that person and they notice that and they flirt with them and they're affected by it. And now you fear the loss of that which you're infatuated with. You fear the loss of that which you want to hold onto. And so you actually are afraid that somebody has more to offer that person than you do. Therefore you retaliate and try to cut that person down.
