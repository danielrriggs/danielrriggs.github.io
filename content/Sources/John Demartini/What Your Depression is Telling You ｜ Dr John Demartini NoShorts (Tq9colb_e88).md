 Anytime you have unrealistic expectations and fantasies and delusions about life, your brain is going to let you know with depression that you have those. So it's not an enemy. It's actually a combination of some things that give you feedback to let you know, to readjust your expectations. Expect people to be both sided. They're going to be sometimes nice, sometimes mean. Expect people to live in their values, not yours. They're going to live in their values. They're not here to live in your values. If you want them to do something that's important to you, you have to communicate what you want in terms of their values to get that outcome.
