 Whatever you value most, your identity revolves around most and you identify by that and you want to be loved and a preacher for that. So whenever you're communicating, if you're not communicating in what they value, they're not listening. They, they tune out, they become disengaged. You see this in schools. Teachers are presenting information that have nothing to do with the child's highest values. The child's disengaged and then they end up being labeled disabled, learning disabled, attention deficit, defiant disorder. They put labels on it because of poor communication. They're not caring enough to communicate what is needing to be said in terms of the child's values. In this case, if we don't care enough about somebody to find out what they value, we're likely to have miscommunication.
