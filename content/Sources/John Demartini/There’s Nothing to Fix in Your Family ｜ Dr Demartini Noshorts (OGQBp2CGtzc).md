 In the Breakthrough Experience, I teach people how to take the things that you resent in somebody because you keep wanting to fix them. You think you're superior and they need to be fixed. And then you find out where do you do all the things that they do. And you find out what's the benefit of what they've done. And you find out that, oh, there's nothing to fix, there's something to appreciate. And if anything you can't appreciate in the family is your own delusion, not their actions usually, you find out that you think, well, that's a terrible thing they've done. No, they're balancing out the family dynamic. Whatever one person's repressing, the other is expressing. Nietzsche wrote about this and many others said that whatever is the collective society's repressing, somebody else is expressing. Well, that occurs in the family.
