 Anything we infatuate with or resent, we keep dealing with. You've probably tried to sleep at night somewhere in your life and you had something that was really, really resentful on your mind, that you really resented, somebody resented, and you really put them down and thought, Oh, I would never do that. And you're too proud to admit it. And then you can't sleep because it's regurgitating in your brain. It's intrusive thoughts and you're basically constantly going through the mind and has difficulty sleeping. And if you infatuate with somebody and minimize yourself, the same thing can occur. Anytime you polarize the mind and exaggerate or minimize others and then yourself, minimize and exaggerate yourself, you have that deflective awareness. It's stored in the subconscious mind. It becomes intrusive thoughts or brain noise, static in the receiving system. And when you do, it just keeps reverberating it, reverberating it, stored in the subconscious mind. The subconscious mind stores all lopsided perceptions until you bring them into balance.
