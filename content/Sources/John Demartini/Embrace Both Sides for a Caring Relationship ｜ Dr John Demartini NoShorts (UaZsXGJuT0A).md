 When you can embrace somebody for the likes and the dislikes, and you somehow just know that you know that there's somebody there that you embrace both sides to and love both sides, you got a partner. If you're talking down to them and you feel like you can live without them that way, you probably got them as an underdog. And they may look up to you and you may be addicted to somebody looking up to you, but that's a short term relationship. If you're sitting there as the underdog and you're minimizing them, why would they stay with you? That's not going to work. You want a match. The way you know you have a match is you have a bantering. A bantering is where you confront them. You can challenge them. You can support them and it goes back and forth and you keep each other in check. And you'll know that because there's just something about them you respect and there's a respect there. You're not infatual with them. You're not resentful to them. There's a respect to them. If you look down to them, you're careless. If you look up to them, you're careful. If you look across to them, you're caring. And that's the one that keeps the rings on the finger.
