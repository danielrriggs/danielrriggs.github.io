 I believe that you sitting here right now can take the time to look honestly at what your life demonstrates, what's most important to you and give yourself permission to do something extraordinary on planet earth by living congruently and setting and prioritizing your life in such a way that no matter what you do, you see it on the way. And you're prioritizing the lower priority things and delegating that to other people so you can get on to doing the thing that it truly inspires you, that really masters your life. This raises your self worth, it increases your net worth, it increases your ability to love yourself and love the people around you and communicate that love. It makes you more appreciative of all of around you and allows you to empower all seven areas of life, your spiritual quest and mental genius, and your vocational service and your financial independence and your family love and intimacy and your social influence and leadership and your physical vitality and power. And even your inner beauty comes to the surface when you're living congruent by your highest values.
