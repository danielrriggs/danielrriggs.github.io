 If you're really, truly setting goals that are congruent with your highest values, you will embrace pain and pleasure in the pursuit of your purpose. Your purpose, your telos, your highest value are one. They're the same thing. So if you're setting a goal that's really aligned with the highest value, you won't stop. You'll just keep going. And even if you, you will see things as feedback mechanisms on the way instead of interruptions in the way.
