 Anytime somebody is living congruently with what's truly important to them, where they're spontaneously inspired from within to fulfill what's meaningful to them, they automatically have more vitality. The thing I always say that your vitality in life is directly proportionate to the vividness of your vision and your vision is crystal clear except when you subordinate to the influence of others and allow the others that you look and see above you to infiltrate you with their own values. When you do, you cloud the clarity of your own vision and cloud the vitality you have and lower the vibrations. The highest vibrations you'll have is when you're authentic. The highest vibration you'll have is when you're inspired from within pursuing the thing that's truly most inspiring and meaningful to you.
