 Whenever you're doing something that's truly meaningful to you, that's inspiring to you, that's the executive center of the brain, a medial prefrontal cortex comes alive, becomes electrified and literally myelinated. The second we are doing what we are really inspired to do and the real entrepreneur, the visionary lives in the executive center where they have inspired visions, they teach strategic plans, they execute the plans and they have self governance and their mastery and persistent and consistent towards their objective and their endure pain and pleasure support or challenge in the pursuit of something that really truly inspires them that makes a difference in the world. That is the future of neurology.
