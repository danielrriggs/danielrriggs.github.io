 I learned that it's not wise to rescue desperation. It's wise to invest in inspiration. And the Rockefellers, um, who I studied, they, uh, they found four laws for principles when it came to charitable and philanthropic work. Number one is never robbed people of dignity, never robbed people of responsibility, never robbed people of accountability, um, and never robbed them of productivity. Because if you do, they will only resent you because they become dependent instead of flourish. So if you give them accountability, they will thrive. So giving somebody for something for nothing will only backfire and the full parts of their money. That's always been proven. So it's not wise to just rescue desperation. It's wise to invest in inspiration.
