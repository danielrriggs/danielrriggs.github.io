 In our lives, we have interaction with other people with a set of values. If we think our values are more important than others, we'll talk down to them. If we think our values are less important than others, we'll look up to them. If we talk down to them, we'll become narcissistic and we'll expect them to do things for us. And we'll expect them to live in our values. We'll tend to project our values onto them. If we look up at them, we'll tend to try to live in their values and we'll inject their values into our life and try to be somebody we're not.
