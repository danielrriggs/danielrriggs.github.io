 So you've got to basically grab your specialized knowledge. You got to be clear about what your focus is, large, broad, or narrow. You got to make sure you build momentum in that area, not only with your knowledge, but by persistent action. You want to prioritize your daily actions. Cause if you're not in your executive center, where creative ideas are born, where you're automatically, you're likely to have self governance and discipline, you're not likely to let yourself get distracted and plateaued by emotions. And you're able to keep building momentum with confidence and self worth.
