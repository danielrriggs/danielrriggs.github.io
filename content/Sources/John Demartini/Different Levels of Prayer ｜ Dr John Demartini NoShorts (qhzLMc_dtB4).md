 Well, I always say that there's different levels of prayer. The highest of prayer would be one of thank you. I love you to the universe because you see the hidden order. There's nothing to fix. There's something to embrace. The lower levels of prayer, the more subtle levels of prayer is when things aren't supporting your values, you're praying for that anthropomorphic deity to take care of that and fix the things that challenge you. The very things that challenge you actually make you grow and you're trying to stay juvenile by praying for having somebody take care of it. But, there's different levels of prayer based on different levels of awareness. The lowest prayer is asking God to fix things according to your needs. And the highest of prayer is thanking God for the way it is, the divine nature, the inherent order that's in the universe. And I always say the highest of prayers is thank you. I love you.
