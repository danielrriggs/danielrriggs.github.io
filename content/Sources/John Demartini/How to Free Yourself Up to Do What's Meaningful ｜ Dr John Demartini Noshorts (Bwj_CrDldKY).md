 I learned from Mary Kay to write down the six or seven highest priority action steps every single day and act on those. And that raises your self-worth whenever you're doing the highest priorities. If you do and you delegate lower priority things and you give yourself permission to go and free yourself up to do what's meaningful, you have a meaningful and inspired life. You cannot have an inspired life if you're doing low priority, desperate things. And you can't have an inspired life unless you're serving somebody to earn a fair, exchanged income to be able to pay for the delegations to liberate you from the lower priority things. So the universe rewards people that care enough about people with equity and serve people that serves themselves. The universe is set up in such a way that we can't really be guided away from what is going to work.
