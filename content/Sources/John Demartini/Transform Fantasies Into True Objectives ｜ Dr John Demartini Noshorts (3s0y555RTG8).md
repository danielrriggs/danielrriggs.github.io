 fantasies are things that you think have an advantage without any disadvantage, a positive without a negative, a pleasure without a pain. And these create a, I might say, an amygdala response where not, that's not where the planning system is. It's in the executive center. So what happens is if you set a real goal, you'll already anticipate the pros and cons, rewards and risks, everything. You'll think it out. You'll have foresight, and you'll imagine what could go both benefit and wrong. And then you go in there and you mitigate those and think, if this happens, how will I solve it? And that's what master planning is. It's basically laying out the life that you'd like to do, concentrating and focusing on how you want it, knowing what obstacles that might happen along the way. How do you solve those in advance so you're prepared, so you're not hit by broadsided by unexpecteds? There's a lot of those unexpecteds can be anticipated and thought through and planned out and prevented or know exactly what to do if it happens.
