 When people live congruently with their highest values and set goals and intentions that are truly meaningful to them, they tend to act and walk their talk and accomplish things and give themselves permission to live in greater time horizons and live with greater space horizons. The factory worker lives hour to hour day to day. The supervisor lives day to day week to week. The lower management week to week month to month. Middle management month to month year to year. Upper management year to year to decade to decade. The CEO decade to generation. The visionary generation to possibly century. The sage century to millenniums, but the soul for eternity.
