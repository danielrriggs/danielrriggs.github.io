 This law applies in every field, whether it be mathematics or science or religion or philosophy or in our daily lives and our sociology. Even the wealth of the nations is amongst the few and the one that has the great wealth and the many that have the lesser wealth. These are laws of nature. And so that's one. And the great secret is realizing that if you apply those laws into your life and set reasonable objectives based on those laws, that you abide in a sense with the laws of the universe. And when you do, the universe helps you fulfill what you're here to do.
