 So a lot of people, when you ask people what's important to them and what their values are, and I've been doing that 45 years of my 51 years of teaching. And I assure you, I've got some demonstrations and proof that not everybody knows themselves as much as they like to think. I have people that come up and say, I want to be financially independent, yet their life is demonstrating that they keep buying consumables that depreciate in value and they're not really doing what's really important to them as far as building wealth. And some people say, I want to have a relationship. Then they realize that they're wounded from the past, they haven't cleared that wound and they're holding onto that wound and they're protecting themselves by making sure that they don't rely on somebody else in a relationship. So what people say is not always what they're actually living. And that's why I want to know what the values of the individual are and what their life demonstrates, because that tells me what's true. And that's why your actions speak louder than your words.
