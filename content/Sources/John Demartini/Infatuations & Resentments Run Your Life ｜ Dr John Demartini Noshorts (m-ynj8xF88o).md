 If you liberate yourself from those things that you're in bondage to, because anything you infatuate or resent occupies space and time in your mind and you have a bondage to it, as the Buddhist says, that which you are attached to, which are infatuated resentments, runs your life. If you balance it, you're liberated from that. You have a freedom from that. You're not reactive, you're proactive, and you're back on track with your priorities again.
