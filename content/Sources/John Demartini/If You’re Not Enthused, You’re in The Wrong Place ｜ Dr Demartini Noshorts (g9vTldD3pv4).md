 If you're not enthused about what you're doing, you're in the wrong place. I tell people, if you don't love what you're doing, God bless, go get another job or find out how what this job is doing is helping you fulfill what's meaningful to you. Either go do what you love and delegate the rest or go and love what you do by linking whatever you're doing to whatever you love. But if you're not, you're not inspired, man, you're not going to have a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of magnetism. I find that people are mad when they're basically really clear about what they're doing. And so I would say prioritize your life on a daily basis. Sit down and go, what's really priority to me? What's really most inspiring to me? What do I spontaneously do? What is it that actually serves the greatest number of people that has a fair exchange in a way I can produce a product, a service or idea that meets people's needs? How can I be of service?
