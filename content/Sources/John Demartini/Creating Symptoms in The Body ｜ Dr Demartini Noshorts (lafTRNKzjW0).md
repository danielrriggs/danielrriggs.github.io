 If we tend to go and exaggerate ourselves, we tend to become narcissistic and want to get something for nothing. If we tend to minimize ourselves, we feel that we owe people something, we want to give something for nothing. Both of those are non-sustainables. But the second we level the playing field and have authenticity, we have now sustainable, fair exchange. Both people want to continue doing business. When you have a win-lose or a lose-win scenario, which is a zero-sum game, somebody wins, somebody loses, it's different than if you have a non-zero-sum game where both people win, a win-win, some people call it. Now that win-win state is healing to the body and that non-win state where I am greater than you or lesser than you creates autonomic responses and creates symptoms in the body.
