 If you'd like to change whatever form of wealth you have into financial wealth, it's going to require that you have a high value on wealth building, financial wealth building. Money circulates through the economy from those who value it least to those who value it most. And if you don't have a work ethic, where you desire to serve people, you're probably not going to have a great source of income. And if you don't have a desire to actually raise your life in the form of financial wealth, you probably won't save and invest portion of it. And if you don't have a value on transcending the goods and bads and the extreme moralities associated with wealth, you'll probably interfere with the wealth building.
