 Stop and reflect and really do an honest evaluation on how do you spend your money. The heart of your values dictates your destiny, dictates your financial destiny. If you don't have a value on wealth building, you probably won't. If you do have a value in wealth building, you'll probably selectively buy things that go up in value, not down in value. I promise you that's worth reflecting on because don't bitch about other people getting you in debt and everything else. It's not that. Or the cost of living. It's a cost that you're choosing to live. There's a difference. And yes, there's inflation. Yes, there's things that definitely make it challenging for many people, but the people that know how to manage their money always take whatever's happening in their environment and using it to their advantage. And they reflect and stop and think, is this an asset or a liability? Most people don't know the difference. They just go and buy something. Is this going to make you go up in value and your life up in value and your wealth up in value? Great. Then invest in it. If it doesn't stop and reflect, is this really that important?
