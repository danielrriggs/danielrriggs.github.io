 Our amygdala is trying to avoid predator and seek prey. And it wants to blame things on the outside and look for saviors on the outside. That's one of the reasons why religions have done so well and pharmaceutical companies have done so well. They can blame a germ or blame a disease and give some sort of solution on the outside. Instead of having people be accountable, which means to be able to bring a balance sheet into their perceptions, accountability to their perceptions. That's the master.

But the real truth is that there's nothing there except a misperception.
