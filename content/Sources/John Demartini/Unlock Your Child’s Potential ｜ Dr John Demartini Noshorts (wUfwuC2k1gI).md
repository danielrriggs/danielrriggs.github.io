 So our kids are more stable. Our kids are more resilient. Our kids are more confident in their highest value. Their brain is developing and they're excelling in that and they gain more momentum and more vision for their life and wake up more leadership roles if they do. So take the time to find out what the current value is and it's evolving and changing. And I would recommend you do the value determination at least quarterly and then communicating what you believe will be of help to them, the chores, their homework, whatever it may be, and find out yourself as a parent and train your children how to find how, whatever they're asked to do, how's it helping them fulfill their highest value. They're more engaged, more inspired to do it. They'll be more resilient when they're doing it, more willing to embrace the pains and pleasures of it if they do. Because whenever you can see that something's helping you fulfill what's most important to you, you have way more perseverance, more resilience, you're way more confident, you build up momentum and you achieve.
