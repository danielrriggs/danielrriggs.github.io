 You're seeing things for the whole, not the parts, and you're re-empowered and then you've extracted from your misperception a fuel of opportunity to go do something and transcend what you were judging. When you do, you now function from a higher level of performance, a transcendent state instead of an imminently emotional state. And as Warren Buffett says, you can't manage money until you can manage your emotions. And transcending emotions is what allow you to manage money, manage leadership, manage relationships, manage health. Every area of life is affected by that judgment split and is healed by the ability to integrate and own all the parts.
