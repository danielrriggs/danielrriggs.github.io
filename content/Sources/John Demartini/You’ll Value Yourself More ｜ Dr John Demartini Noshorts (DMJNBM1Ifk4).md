 By the way, when you're doing something that's meaningful, you'll tend to spend your money more wisely. You'll value yourself more. You'll tend to be more philanthropic. You'll tend to invest in yourself and invest and eventually work towards having money work for you as a master, you as a master of money, instead of being a slave to it. But if you're unfulfilled in it, you'll probably squandered on immediate gratifying things to give you feeling of fulfillment because you're not fulfilled in your career. If you're unfulfilled in your career, you'll tend to overeat more, overdrink more, overparty more, or do whatever it is that's, you might say, an immediate gratifying to compensate.
