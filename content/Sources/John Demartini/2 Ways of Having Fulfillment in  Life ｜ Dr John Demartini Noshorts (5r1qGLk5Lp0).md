 There's only two ways of having fulfillment in life that I'm aware of. Either setting goals and intentions that are congruent and aligned with your highest value or changing your values to align with your goals. Because if you find out that what's highest on your value, doing it, is not leading you to other goals that you would like to accomplish, which are maybe lower on the values at this time, then they can be changed. You can shift values. Your life is doing it throughout your life anyway. But you can cognitively do that with a science to shift values. But the key is making sure there's congruency between highest values and goals.
