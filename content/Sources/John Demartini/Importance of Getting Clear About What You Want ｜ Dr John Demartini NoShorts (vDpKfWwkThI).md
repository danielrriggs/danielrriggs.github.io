 You also have to have a clear vision of what you want. Because if you're not clear about it, people can sense that, and they're not feeling confident about it. When doctors are doing care on patients, patients can feel if they're confident. And if you don't have the confidence, they can pick it up, it's a vibe and they can sense. So you want to make sure you stick with your core competence and expand your core competence on a daily basis. Document what's working and what's not working. Metric your goals and objectives. They take you to new levels. And then make sure you have a clear vision of where you want to go. And if that vision is so crystal clear that nothing's in its way, you'll get there.
