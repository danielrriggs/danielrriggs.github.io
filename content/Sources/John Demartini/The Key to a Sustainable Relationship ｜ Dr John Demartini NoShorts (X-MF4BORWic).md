 To care about somebody is not to look down and talk to them down or look up and sit there as an underdog. It's learning how to communicate as an equal with respect, how to communicate what's important to you in terms of what's important to them. When that occurs, they respect you. Healthy relationship has a nice healthy bantering. If you're the one on top and they're below and they're desperately holding on to you, then you kind of get bored with it and you go, eh, go get a life. You're the one on the bottom and they're on top and you're all enamored with them and they're going to talk down to you and you're going to be the underdog and they're going to walk all over you. It's when you have a nice balance where you can respect them and they have power and you have power and you're communicating in their values and they're communicating in your values that way, not sacrificing but communicating what's important to each other, you have a lasting and sustainable relationship. Caring is the key to a sustainable relationship.
