 The stress is an inability to adapt to a changing environment. And there's two primary forms of stress, the fear of loss of that which we seek and the fear of gain of that which we try to avoid. The things we're philic or phobic about are attracted or repelled by. Anytime we're emotionally attracted or repulsive with impulses or instincts, we're automatically in uncertainty. I think it was even the Heisenberg, the German quantum physicist that said that the uncertainty principle was based on what he called fermions, which is based on the principle of matter that's basically polarized and charged. So the second we're emotionally charged and things matter to us, we're automatically in the uncertainty principle and we basically don't know what's going to happen in the future. But if we go in there and balance our equation, we go into boson statistics and we don't have uncertainty, we have presence and knowing.
