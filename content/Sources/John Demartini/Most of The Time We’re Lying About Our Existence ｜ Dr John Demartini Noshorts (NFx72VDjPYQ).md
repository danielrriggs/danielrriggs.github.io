 Most of the time we're lying about our existence. We're constantly going around. We walk in a mall, we exaggerate people and minimize people and judge people and living in this strife constantly. We have internal strife, as Empedocles said, instead of a moment of love. In a moment of love, we have gnosis. We know things. When we're infatuated and we're blind to the downside, we don't know the person. When we're resentful and we're blind to the upside, we don't know the person. When we love the person, we get to know the person. We get to see both sides simultaneously. Wilhelm Watt said the simultaneity of these complementary opposites is what our maximum potential is. The speed in which we see both sides of an event or an individual is the wisdom we have in life. If it takes us weeks to see the downside of somebody we're infatuated or weeks to see the upside of the person we resent, we're not too bright. We're a bit dense. We're weighted down with our gravitational emotional baggage. Instead of lightened up with our love and pure reflective awareness.
