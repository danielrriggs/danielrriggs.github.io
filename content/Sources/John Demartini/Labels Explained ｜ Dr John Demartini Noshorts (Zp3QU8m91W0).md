 So everybody in this room has an area where there's order and there's chaos. Everybody here has that. Raise your hand if you know that's true in your life. So if somebody says and labels you disorganized, it just means that somebody with a different set of values is projecting onto you an expectation for you to live in their values and they're not honoring where you have order and organization. You do. It's in your highest values, just not theirs. So labels are usually projections from one person onto another. And if you perceive that you're not very disciplined, then you're basically expecting yourself to live in somebody else's values, not your own.
