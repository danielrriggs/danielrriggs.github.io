 Your vitality in life is directly proportionate to the vividness of your vision. If you're clear about what your mission is, clear about the vision you want to accomplish, your energy levels are going to be up. In fact, if you take somebody that's kind of down in energy and you're not feeling all that vital and ask them, where are you going? What's your mission? What are you doing? They're going to say, I don't know. But if you take somebody who's on fire and enthused and inspired by some mission, you're going to see the energy levels go up. You'll find that people that are leaders that take command and are living prioritized, they have way more energy than people that are just doing something they're unengaged in.
