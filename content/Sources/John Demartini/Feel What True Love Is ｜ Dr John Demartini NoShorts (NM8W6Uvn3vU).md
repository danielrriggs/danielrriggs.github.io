 You know in the Hindu concept of the Trimurti, the divinity of three in one, you have Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. You have what some have called the builder, the maintainer and destroyer. Even though those are different attributes of the divinity, which is inherent in nature, we have spring and we have fall, we have summer and we have winter, we have build and we have decay, growth and decay. These are polarities that are inherent in nature. And they are in our own thoughts. They are in our own actions. They're in our own experiences. So to embrace that we're both builders and destroyers, to embrace that we're both unifiers and dividers, I think is wisdom. I think that the law of one in many, similar in differences, the polarities like that are essentially to be embraced. And I think that when we do, we feel what true love is.
