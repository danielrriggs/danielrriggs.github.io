 You need to know what you value. Then you want to care enough about other people that you're going to be doing business with or raising children or loved ones or whatever, and take the time to find out what they value. Find out what's important to them. Because if you can't see what they're dedicated to is serving you, you're going to want to fix them and change them and they're going to feel alienated and they're not going to want to listen. And if you're not caring about yourself and you're not understanding what your value, the same thing in reverse can occur. So you want to make sure that you find out what you value and hopefully find out what the people that you're going to communicate with value.
