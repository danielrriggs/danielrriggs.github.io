 Well, sometimes we're creating this so-called toxic dynamic by simply not caring about the individual in relationship with and learning the art of communicating what we value in terms of what they value. If we don't care enough to know what their values are, we won't do it. We won't learn how to communicate in their values. The second we communicate in their values, what we want, would they win as we win, that same person that we thought was toxic turns out to be very tonic. And we wouldn't have been with that person in that relationship at all, if we hadn't have thought at one point that they were tonic, they were a contribution to our life. So somehow our communication skills have deteriorated the relationship because we're not honoring and respecting them for who they are. They want to be loved and appreciated for who they are, not for who you are supposed to make them.
