 Every time we see what I call the divine order, the magnificent, implicated order of the universe, we grow and emerge a new concentric sphere of thinking. Our sphere of influence and our sphere of awareness expands on the great deep, as Emerson said. But I do believe that we have two sides to our nature and a center. When we exaggerate ourselves and puff ourselves up, we get proud, you might say. And what we do is we tend to think that others are less important than us, and we tend to go towards narcissism, and we want to receive from others and have them do things for us, because we think we're more important than them. When we beat ourselves up and minimize ourselves, we tend to think others are more important than us, and we want to do things for others, and we become more altruistic. One, that is focused on service. The other is focused on reward. When you're true to yourself and balanced in yourself, you realize that the people around you are not below you or above you. They're reflections of you.
