 If you exaggerate yourself, you'll attract people to humble you because outside society will help you find yourself. I've said before that everything that's going on in your life is a feedback mechanism to help you be you. I'm going to say that again. Everything that goes on in your life, in the seven areas of life, act as feedback mechanisms to help you be the authentic you. So if you exaggerate yourself, somebody will come in to humble you. If you minimize yourself, they'll lift you up. Nature is always trying to bring you back into equanimity.
