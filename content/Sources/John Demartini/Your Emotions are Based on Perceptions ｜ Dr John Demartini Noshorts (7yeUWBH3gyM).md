 Your emotions are based on perceptions. If you perceive more positive than negative, you go towards happiness, you stimulate dopamine and kefalons, oxytocin, endorphins, and you can become infatuated and addicted to that which you see. If you see more drawbacks and benefits, more pain and pleasure, you create new polypeptides in the brain, and you repel, and it hurts, and you repel from it. Your emotions are perfect reflections of your perceptions, which are a byproduct of your values.
