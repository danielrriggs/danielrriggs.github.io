 Everything you can see in others you have inside you, but it's in a different form. You've got to honor the form yours is in and not exaggerate the form theirs is in. And once you do, you calm yourself down for both envy and jealousy. But envy and jealousy can be a catalyst for you to empower your life and to realize what you're not honoring in yourself. And the more you value it in yourself and recognize it in yourself, the more the world will. When you empower you, the world sees your power. When you value yourself, the world values you too.
