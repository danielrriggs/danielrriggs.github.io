 If you are expecting yourself to do something that's not valuable to, you're not going to do it. But by stacking up enough benefits of doing it, you'll change your behavior and get a change in life. So you have the capacity to ask questions. How specifically is doing the actions that I know are wise to do, wise in fitness, wise in health, wise in life, how's it helping me do and fulfill what's most important to me? And you could even put it in reverse. How is doing those other activities, the things that are important to you, helping you with fitness or helping you with your nutritional routine. You want to ask how specifically is doing the wisest actions when it comes to your overall wellbeing and fitness and health, how specifically is it going to help you get what's most important to you? Because when you link it to what is most important to you, you increase the probabilities of you acting on it and it becomes your way of life. It's not because you have to do it, not because you're suppressing yourself if you don't, it's a matter of because it's just the way you perceive your behavior.
