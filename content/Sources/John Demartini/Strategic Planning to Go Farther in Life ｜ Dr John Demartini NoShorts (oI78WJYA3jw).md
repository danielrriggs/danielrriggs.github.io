 People who don't plan things and don't put things with foresight will be automatically, tele-nomically sit there with hindsight. They'll be sitting there with trial and error. And it's much more efficient to have foresight and mentorship than it is to go through trial and error. So planning ahead, strategic planning, is one of the executive center's purpose. And people who do that, they get advantages.
