 I asked people in audiences from small to large, how many of you want to be financially independent? Everybody puts their hand up. About 99 to 100%. Right. Then I asked them, what percentage of the population reach financial independence? Two percent. One percent. Actually less. And I said, so that means that 99% of you are diluted in all probability. And I can tell you this, that they don't really have a value on wealth building. They have a value on living the lifestyles of the rich and famous and spending money on the lifestyle. And if you have a desire to spend money on the lifestyle and not actually on building wealth, then the second you get money, you'll keep raising your lifestyle and never accumulate wealth.
