 The perception of failure often comes as a result of trying to do something that is not really, really, really highest on our values. Just like a young boy who loves his video games, when he's doing something really high and his values like video games, he will conquer the video game. Even if it challenges him, he'll get up and he'll beat it up and eventually look for a more challenging game. That's a sign. When you're pursuing challenges that really inspire you, you know you're doing something really valuable. But if you're doing something like your chores, your homework, maybe you're cleaning your room or whatever, that same boy is going to give up. He's not going to want to continue. He's not going to persevere.
