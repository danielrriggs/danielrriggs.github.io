 You want to make sure that you keep asking yourself on anything that you know that we wise to do in your life that you've learned. The wise thing to do is to ask how specifically is doing this action going to help me fulfill what is valuable to me and keep answering that question and don't answer it just five or six times. That's not going to make much of a difference. I want you to answer it until you really are actually grateful for the opportunity to do it and your life changes behavior.
