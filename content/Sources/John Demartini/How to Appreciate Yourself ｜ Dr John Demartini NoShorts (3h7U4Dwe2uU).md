 But to bang your head against the wall, trying to be somebody you're not, will only be self-defeating. You gotta give yourself permission to be you. The most magnificent you is you. And anytime you compare yourself to a fantasy, you're not gonna appreciate you. And a lot of people do that. And a lot of people think it should be this, and it should be that. I'm convinced that the only reason people aren't clear about their mission is because of their comparison to other people, and their subordination to people that they think have something they don't. And they're basically thinking that they're more intelligent, they're more successful, that they have more wealth, they have more better relationship, more social savvy, more physically fit, or more spiritually aware. And they're minimizing themselves to people they do instead of identifying where they have what those people have in their own value system.
