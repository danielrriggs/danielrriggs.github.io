 find out how to fulfill the needs of other people and find out which of those needs inspire you. So if you can get, if you can't wait to get up in the morning and deliver those needs and they can't wait to get those needs, you found your niche. But if you project your values onto the world and think, Oh, this is what the world needs, you're probably going to bang your head against the wall. And if you go out and find something that doesn't bring meaning to you and it's not inspiring to you, you're not going to want to go to work, but you got to find out where they overlap. There's like a Vesica Pisces, two sacred circles overlapping in the center is where the power is. And if you basically find out where, what you're inspired to do and what they're inspired to receive, you found your niche and you're on your way. And being an entrepreneur is not even difficulty if you find that niche.
