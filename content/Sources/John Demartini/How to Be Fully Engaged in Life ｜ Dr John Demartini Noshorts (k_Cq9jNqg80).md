 People who are not inspired by what they do need motivation and incentives to continue to do it. The most primitive of the incentives are pain and pleasure. So that's called punishment and reward. So in other words, when a person at work is not engaged at work and they're not inspired by what they're doing, you'll end up having to punish and reward those people with incentives to get them to do things. They're not engaged. They're not inspired. When you're living congruently with your highest values, you're fully engaged in life. Engaged in whatever it is you're doing. But when you're living by lower values or attempting to live by lower values, you're not engaged and you need outside influence. So motivation is never a solution. Motivation is a symptom of an engaged person. So that's why I'm not a motivational speaker and I don't encourage motivational systems.
