 In your life, you have moments when you exaggerate yourself and puff yourself up and inflate yourself, have a superiority complex and feel self righteous and you exaggerate yourself. And there's other times when you deflate yourself and minimize yourself and feel maybe an inferiority complex or a self-raunchous state, I mean at that turn. And we exaggerate or minimize ourselves. And there's other times when we actually come back into self governance and center ourselves and become authentic. When we exaggerate ourselves, we're not ourselves. When we minimize ourselves, we're not ourselves. But when we're balanced and poised and present and purposeful, we're centered.
