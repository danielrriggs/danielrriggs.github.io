 The person who's letting the inner voice and the inner vision run their life, which are the great leaders, they didn't let the world on the outside dictate their destiny. They let the voice and vision on the inside determine. And what happened is they followed that. I always say a genius is one who listens to their inner voice and obeys their inner vision and follows it regardless of the outer circumstances. People that are outer directed are exactly that. They're directed by the circumstances. The people who are inner directed live in the dance.
