 So sometimes we end up having these subjective bias perceptions of people because we keep projecting our values onto them, challenging them in their values, not honoring their values. They retaliate with responses that we don't like. We call them toxic with a label. And in fact, they're just human beings that have both sides, but we keep initiating the side we don't want because we keep projecting onto them our values and expectations that don't match theirs.
