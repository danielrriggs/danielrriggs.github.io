 If you look carefully at what you do spontaneously that nobody has to remind you to do every single day, you just do it. Nobody has to remind you to do it. Look there. You may be comparing it to other people and not appreciating what that calling is and therefore think you don't know what it is, but your life is demonstrating it. Your life is demonstrating your purpose every single day, but you can't see it because you're comparing yourself to others and thinking it's not good enough. And therefore you're devaluing what is actually your calling.
