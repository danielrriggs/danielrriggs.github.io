 ask yourself, what is it specifically that they've done or not done that you dislike or resent that's making you want to label them toxic? And then in the process of doing that, go look deeply in yourself and reflect and go look at where and when have you demonstrate or displayed that same behavior in your own life and to who you, you've done it and who sees you doing it. And if you really go in there and look carefully on multiple times, you'll eventually discover that what you see in them is you. And the reason you're resenting them is because it's reminding you of a part of you you feel may be ashamed of.
