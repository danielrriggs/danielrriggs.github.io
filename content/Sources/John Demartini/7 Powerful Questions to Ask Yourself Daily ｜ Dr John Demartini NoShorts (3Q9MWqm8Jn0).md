 There's seven questions you want to ask yourself every day. What is it I would absolutely love to do in life? How do I get handsomely paid to do it? Though never asked, how do I afford to do it? That's a debt thinking. How do I get handsomely and beautifully paid to do it? I love, what are the highest priority actions I can do today to make that happen? What obstacles might I run into and how do I solve in advance with foresight and planning? What worked and what didn't work today? How do I do it more effectively and efficiently tomorrow? And how did, no matter what happened today, how did it get me one step closer to that? If you ask those seven questions, quite amazing things start happening in your life.
