 If you break your debt, your total, down into small bytes and convert your units of debt into units of service or units of products that you sell, things you do to pay off the debt, and focus on the service or the product selling, your debt will go away. But if you focus on the debt, your products and service sales will go away. If you focus on the problem, the debt, instead of focus on the solution, the service, the other side of the equation tends to enhance. So if you focus on the debt, the debt tends to grow. If you focus on the service, the service tends to grow. Wherever you put your intention is what tends to grow. So always chunk your debts down into small bytes, break them down by the inch, it's a cinch, and break it down into how much it is per hour, per minute or whatever. The smaller the increments you do, the less it seems overwhelming.
