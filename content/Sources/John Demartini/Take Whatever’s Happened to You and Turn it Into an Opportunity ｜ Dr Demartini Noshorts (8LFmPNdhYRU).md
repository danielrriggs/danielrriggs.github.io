 It's not what happens to you, it's your perception decisions and actions from it. And you can take anything that's ever happened to you and you can find the upsides to it. I do it every week, working with people. And every time I do the Breakthrough Experience, every single time I do it, I'm helping people transform the story that they've run in their life, the childhood victim story into a victor story. And to find out how whatever's happened is on the way, not in the way. And a lot of people will run that story because it's been convenient. They've leveraged it with unconscious motives to hold onto the story instead of actually going and transforming it into an opportunity and doing something extraordinary with their life.
