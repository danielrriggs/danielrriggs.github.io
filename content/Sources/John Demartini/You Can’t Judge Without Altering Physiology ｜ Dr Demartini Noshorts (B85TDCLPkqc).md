 When we feel challenged, we tend to get defensive. When we get supported, we tend to become juvenilly dependent. And if we get challenged, precociously independent. One's rest and digest. One's fight or flight. One's parasympathetic. One's sympathetic. One causes the blood sugar to go down and the other one causes it to go up. So our blood sugar and our pancreas secretes in a sense, glucagon or insulin to regulate blood pressure, blood sugar, I mean, in order to do it. It also affects blood pressure. So our blood pressure, our blood sugar, our salt secretions, our fatty acids, all of our body is creating signs and symptoms anytime we're judging. In fact, you can't judge without altering physiology and you can actually test those. We have an autonomic dysregulation syndrome. The longer we hold onto judgments and the more we hold onto judgments, the more inauthentic we are.
