 How many of you had things happen you thought were terrible in a week, a month, a year later, you went, thank God that occurred? Well, you've done the same thing. Things you thought were terrible had served, too. You just didn't see the service, so you're minimizing yourself. But whatever you've done is part of service. So you might as well get over that and transcend it and love it and appreciate yourself. Until you value yourself, no one else will.
