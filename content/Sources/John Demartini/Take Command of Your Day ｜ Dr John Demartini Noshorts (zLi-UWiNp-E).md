 Each of us are trying to fulfill what we value most consciously or unconsciously. If we don't take command of our day, the people around us do. If we don't fill our day with high priority actions that inspire us, it will fill up with low priority distractions that are imposed by others. I think everybody here has experienced that in some form. But that applies and spills over to every area. The way we manage money, the way we manage our time, the way we manage people, etc.
