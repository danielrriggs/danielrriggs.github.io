 because there's no reason why you have to be trapped in these black and white labels. I call that the lowest level. Kohlberg to psychologists in the lowest level morality was punishment reward. The next one is subordination to mothers and fathers and preachers and teachers to their ideals in a society instead of living authentically. And then finally you go to a post conventional state where you transcend those boxes and go into, have a universal awareness. Universal laws, nobody breaks. Human laws, we all break. There's no such thing as a person that doesn't break or infringe on some sort of human law. Probably if you look carefully in your life, that's pretty normal.
