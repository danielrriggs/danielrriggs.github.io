 Our brain, literally, it's like a tree. A branch of a tree that goes to the light gets stronger and the one that is basically shaded over by the ones that reach the light die out. The neurons in the brain by the glial cells will remyelinate, neutrify, and neurogenically grow to more powerful states and enhance our brain function whenever we're living according to our highest value. And whenever we're not, we deteriorate our brain and literally accumulate toxic debris and proteins in the brain and deteriorate our brain so the brain will die so it doesn't use glucose and oxygen inefficiently. The brain is a highest value seeking and promoting organ. It's trying to help us.
