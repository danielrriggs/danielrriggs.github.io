 Our addiction to pride is probably one of the biggest obstacles to achievement. Our addiction to support and praise blocks us from being integral. We have to be able to be integral and speak things both sided, embrace both sides if we want to master the game. So the fear of rejection, the fear of criticism, the fear of shame, all those are a result of not living by what's valuable to you. So if you're not taking the time to prioritize your day or week or month or year or generation or life, you have a high probability of fitting in and subordinating to the world around you.
