 See, anything that we don't love, that we minimize or exaggerate, that we are attracted to or repelled from in a sense, and we have emotions about, runs us. Let me give you an example. If we're walking down the street and we see somebody that's extremely attracted to us, and we're very elated with it, and we're infatuated with it, and then we try to go to work, we're so consumed by what we're infatuated with that it runs our mind. Anything that we infatuate with consumes space and time in our mind and distracts us. It's the same thing if all of a sudden we're walking and we see somebody that we resent, we avoid, don't like, we have negative associations with. What happens if we go to work, they consume space and time in our mind, and now we're run by the thing that we're seeing negatives in. So if we have an imbalanced perspective and we see way more pauses and we're infatuated or way more negatives and we're resentful, then our mind is in a sense consumed by those things and our mind is not clear to create what our heart's desiring. Our emotions are running us.
