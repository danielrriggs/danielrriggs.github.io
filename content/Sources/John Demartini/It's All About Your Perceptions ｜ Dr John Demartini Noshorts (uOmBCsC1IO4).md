 Whenever a person goes through life and they think that somehow the events that occur in their life are caused by outside sources, then what they do is they, in a sense, disempower their lives because they may not be able to do anything about the outside sources. The truth is that the people that are having experiences, it's not the outside, it's their perception of the outside. And once they realize that it's their perceptions, their attentions, and their intentions that determine their reality, then what happens is the outer world doesn't run their life anymore.
