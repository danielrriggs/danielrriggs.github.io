 Living authentically according to the soul, the state of unconditional love, the moment of love maximizes our potential in life. Are we going to live there every day all day long? No. Is there somebody that's done that? No. And even though that likes to market, you know, people are sold by the opium of the fantasy of that. We are growing every day. We're learning, we judge, we transcend that, we integrate, we go on to the next thing. We have moments of unconditional love. We have moments of authenticity. But what's interesting is inside our psyche, whenever we exaggerate ourselves by the licensing effect, we also minimize ourselves, but we're only conscious of one and unconscious of the other. They're actually integrated at the time. So even though we don't know in our outer experience and our existential experience, we don't know that we're having a balance. There is still a balance going on. There still is an equanimity, therefore the immortal soul. And the impact we have by being authentic last.
