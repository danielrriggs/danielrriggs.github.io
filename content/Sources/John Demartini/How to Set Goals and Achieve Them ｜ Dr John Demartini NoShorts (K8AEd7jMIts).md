 Imagine if you set a goal that is not aligned with your highest value, you're going to end up with what I call the A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H's of negativity. You're going to be angry at yourself, aggressive at yourself, beat yourself up and feel like you betrayed yourself, et cetera. But if you set goals that are congruent, you're going to feel inspired. You're going to feel more fulfilled. You're going to feel more achieving. So it's very important to make sure that you do one of two things, either set goals in life that are aligned with your highest value, or change your values to match your goals.
