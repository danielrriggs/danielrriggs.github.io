 Anytime you're not filling your day with the highest priority things that are most inspiring to you, their highest on your values where you have a spontaneous calling to act, if you're doing things lower on your values, doing things that you think you have to do, got to do, supposed to do, should do, that are extrinsically called to do, you might say things that are being told from the outside to do, you're going to need motivation.
