 quality questions, one that equilibrate to mine and bring balance to awareness, so you're fully conscious instead of consciously unconsciously divided. So I'm a firm believer that if you take the time to go and ask those questions, your life changes. We accumulate a lot of anxieties and phobias and fears and have a lot of uncertainties. And a lot of the problems that are life are because we're not taking the time to see both sides. We're letting the external world and the moral hypocrisies we've been taught from mothers, fathers, preachers, teachers, and conventions and traditions about what's good and bad out there, and not allowing ourselves to see beyond that and have a meta-ethical position where we see both sides in an event where it's neither good nor evil. It's just an event. And we now use the event to our greatest potential. That's being resourceful. That's being resilient. That's being adaptable to a changing environment. That's being prepared no matter what happens in our life. We see things on the way and not in the way. We're now masters of destiny, not victims of history.
