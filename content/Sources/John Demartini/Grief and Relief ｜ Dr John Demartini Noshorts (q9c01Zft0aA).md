 But I find that there's actually a relief of the loss of the parts you didn't like, and there's a grief of the loss of the parts you liked. And that was a really interesting realization. So that meant that you're really judging somebody if you're grieving and you're dividing the individual up into parts you liked and disliked. And because of our amygdala, our subcortical amygdala, which wants to avoid predator and seek prey, wants to avoid challenge and seek support, wants to avoid negatives and seek pauses, we go into our amygdala upon the death process, which is a survival response. And we tend to concentrate on the things that are positive. And then we fear the loss of the things that we attach to that is positive. And we fear the gain of the things that we resent about a person. So that means we have grief over the loss of the parts we admire, and we have relief over the parts we despised.
