 Accessing the highest values, looking at how you fill your space, looking at how you spend your time, looking at how you spend your energy, look at where you actually are inspired to spend your money. Look at where you're most organized. Look at where you're most disciplined. Look at what your inner most dominant thought is, what your inner most dominant vision is, what your internal dialogue is about, what you most externally want to converse with others about, what you're inspired by, what you're actually set goals that are most achieved and the things that you can't wait to get up and learn. These items, these value determinants, these indicate what's really valuable in your life, what you truly are inspired to do and setting goals that are congruent with that, activate your leadership, make you walk your talk, literally awaken inside you, the genius inside and the wisdom that you have inside.
