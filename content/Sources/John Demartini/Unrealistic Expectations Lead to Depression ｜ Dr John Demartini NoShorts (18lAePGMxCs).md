 If you have an unrealistic expectation on life, you're designed to be depressed. I'm even going to go to Soros saying that depression is not your enemy. Your depression is your friend. It's letting you know when you're experiencing unrealistic expectations on yourself, others, the world, or on mechanical objects, or even on animals. Anytime you have an unrealistic expectation on others for them to be one sided instead of both sided, you're going to end up being angry and possibly depressed.
