 It's a misinterpretation of what's going on. And it's an assumption that we've caused more pain and pleasure, more loss and gain, more negative than positive, more challenge and support to somebody, which is a division. The matrix of love is not disturbable. We can't disturb it. Only our ignorance and our projection of evaluations lead to that result. So we have to, we have to get beyond that and realize that we're here. We're part of a matrix. If there is a divinity that's omnipresent and an intelligence that permeates the universe, as Einstein said, we're part of it. We can't screw it up. We just think we can.
