 You know, if you stop and look at it, if you go out and pursue something that's a fantasy, a fantasy is something that's got all positives, no negatives, a nightmare has got something that's got more negatives than positives. If you pursue a fantasy, your own intuition will whisper to you the downsides and to make you doubt and insecure and fearful and everything else in order to show you the downsides to the fantasy, to crack the fantasy, to get you back onto an objective. Your executive center and the forebrain is actually designed to transform fantasies into objectives. But when you're told you're supposed to be nice, never mean, kind, never cruel, you set up a fantasy for your life, and then the other side has to come up. And then when you're addicted to this side and then this side shows up, you want to blame them for interfering with your fantasy. So we go around and we tend to blame people or blame ourselves when we're not living up to the fantasy of a one-sided situation. But actually the blaming mechanism is actually a feedback system to let us know that we have an unrealistic expectation on people to be one-sided.
