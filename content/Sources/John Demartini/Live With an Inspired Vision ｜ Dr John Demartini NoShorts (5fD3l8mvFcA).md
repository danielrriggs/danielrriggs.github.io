 So my message today is give yourself permission to live congruently, live authentically, live with an inspired vision and allow the genius that you're destined to reveal to the world, the message and the mission that you're here to share with the world to come to the surface so you can master your life and exemplify what's possible for other human beings. And give yourself permission to do something extraordinary on planet earth. Be an unborrowed visionary and share your message with the world.
