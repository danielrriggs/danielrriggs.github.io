 Our symptoms are there to wake us up to what we're in judging that we're storing in our subconscious mind that aren't balanced, to give us an opportunity to go back and balance it and liberate ourselves from that emotion and go back into authenticity. And the moment we have authenticity, we have an equanimity state, we have an equity state, we get to love and appreciate another individual and ourself. And then that brings the autonomic regulation instead of dysregulation and brings wellness. And then now we change the physiology into a wellness quotient. So we can either live in illness or wellness. We can be sitting there and judging or loving. It was Empedocles, the Greek philosopher, 2005, 600 years ago, that basically said that there's love and strife in the world. And if we have love, we've integrated ourself in the four elements, as he called it. And when there's strife, we've disintegrated ourself. Well, that's the thing. Disease, which is disintegration, verse ease, which is integration.
