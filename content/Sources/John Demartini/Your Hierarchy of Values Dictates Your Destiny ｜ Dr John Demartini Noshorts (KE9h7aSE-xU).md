 I have people, you know, they go out and they say, well, I want to be financially independent. And they don't have a real value on financial independence. They have a value on buying immediate, gratifying consumables that depreciate value. And they can't seem to get ahead. And they keep thinking, I keep making mistakes. I keep being sidetracked. I keep not being disciplined. And they expect themselves to be doing something that's not really important to them, but they think it's important to them. They wish it was important to them, but it's not really important to them. Your hierarchy of values dictates your destiny and makes all your decisions. All your perception decisions and actions are based on it. If you expect yourself to live outside that you're going to feel betrayed. You're going to feel frustrated. You're going to end up self-depreciating. A lot of self-depreciation comes from expecting yourself to live in other people's values to try to be second at being somebody else.
