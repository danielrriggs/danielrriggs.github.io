 Well, the only time we're not appreciating and loving ourselves is when we're comparing our daily actions to other people's values that we've injected in, that we've subordinated to. Because when we actually look at our own values and we're living by our own highest values, we thank ourselves. We can look in the mirror and say, thank you. I love you. You're a hot person. You're amazing. If you can't look in the mirror and say, you're amazing and thank God I get to be you. I was asked by, I think it was a Vogue magazine, they were interviewing me and they asked me, Dr. Demartini, if there's anybody in the world who you could be, who would you be? And I go, I have no desire to be anybody but me. I'm the guy that I'd rather be. And they go, oh, okay. They were expecting me to come up with some other person's name. Every time you're living congruently, your self-worth goes up, you're grateful, you're having a desire to solve problems that help people and your self-worth is going to go up. Living congruently is one of the most important things we can do.
