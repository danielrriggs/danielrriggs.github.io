 The human mind lives with positive and negative, like a magnet. If we're having negative thoughts, I don't say cancel them out. I say learn from them. They're trying to guide you to set real, realistic objectives that you have plans for. Whenever I have a negative thought about myself, that means I'm expecting something outside my values, or I'm expecting something that's not planned out and broken down into small enough bites that I can see myself accomplishing. And my negative thinking brings me back to set true goals that inspire me.
