 The more you seek one side, the more you attract the other side. They're pairs of opposites. So I don't promote a one-sided pursuits. They're fantasies and fantasies lead to really let downs and nightmares. I'm interested in pursuing objectives. There's a very interesting thing. If you pursue challenges that inspire you and embrace the pains and pleasures in the pursuit of it, you have the most stable focus. But if you're trying to get a one-sided world where there's all pleasure, no pain, like a hedonistic pursuit, you usually end up with a nightmare. It's like taking opium and expecting to have pleasure without pain, side effects and withdrawal symptoms and addictions. So it's not wise to go and try to find a one-sided world.
