 Our highest value, the ancient Greeks called the telos. And they made a study of it, Aristotle made a study of it and called it teleology. And teleology is the study of meaning and purpose. So whatever is highest on our value is the most meaningful, the most inspiring, the most fulfilling, the most purposeful thing we can do. When we're looking for our purpose, we look no further than that highest value.
