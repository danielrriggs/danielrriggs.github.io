 you're not going to build a business narcissistically and not thinking about your customer's needs, your employee's needs. You're not going to build a relationship unless you think about your partner's needs. You're not going to have a social life if you don't care about the people you're involving your life with. So it demands a balance of support and challenge and you might say narcissism altruism, has to be able to serve other people at the same time serve you. This has to find an equanimity within you and an equity between you and other people to maximize itself. So the empowerment of those seven areas is not a narcissistic pursuit. It's a mixture of narcissistic altruistic blend. It's a perfect service to others and rewards to self. We have a motor cortex for actions to serve. We have a sensory cortex for rewards to receive. When we balance those, we have fulfillment. And if you ask people, what's the most fulfilling thing they have in a moment in their life, they'll find that it's usually when they're doing something that makes a difference in people's lives and people say, thank you.
