 Anytime you have an imbalanced ratio of perceptions, you've got emotions and emotions are causal and they basically keep you in this regurgitating and static in the brain and this noise in the brain and you're trapped.

And so therefore the bondagement of this so-called karmic wheel is simply our inability to ask the right questions, to balance out the equation, to gather reflective awareness over deflections.
