 Every human being both builds and destroys. You cannot build anything without destroying something. So to live in a fantasy, you're supposed to build without destroy, it's a delusion. You can't build a building without taking minerals, rocks, wood, something from somewhere else to build something. So the idea of building and destroying are always in equilibrium in nature. You can't, to even think you're going to do one without the other is just delusion. So to think you're going to have that outcome, you're fantasizing. So you have to honor the destructive part of your own nature. If you're trying to get rid of half of yourself and love yourself, it's not going to happen. You got to learn that you're both builder and destroy. You're a transformer. You're a Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, as they say in the Hindu Trimairnity, you're both sides.
