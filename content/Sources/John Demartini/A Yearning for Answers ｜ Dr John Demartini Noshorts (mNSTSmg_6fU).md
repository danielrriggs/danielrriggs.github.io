 Because man, his mind and body are in a sense finite through the senses, therefore it has what is known by the senses empirically. And then it has that which is beyond the senses. So it has a known and it has an unknown. It has a history and it has a mystery. It has that which is answered and that which is still questioned, that which is solution and that which is still problem. And because there's always a problem, mystery and question that's yearning inside us, a void that we're striving to fill, we always have a yearning to try to solve the next mystery and to grow and expand on the great deep. That mystery is always the part that awakens inside us, the yearning for answers. And religion is a way of giving us those answers intermediately until science closes it and answers that from the natural laws and finds the hidden order in it, finds the rationality in it. So we must have in a sense, religion and the mystical component to keep us on the quest, but we must have the rational component to keep closing down and bringing the order to that which was chaos.
