 Anytime you expect somebody to do something that is in line with their true highest value, they will not let you down. They'll get it done. They won't betray you. They'll be loyal to you because your expectations are in line with their values. So you'll probably label them very committed and very loyal and very self, you know, they're reliable. That's the way you label them. They're, they're focused, they're reliable, they're disciplined, et cetera. You'll put that label on them. But you, if you expected them to do something that's low on your value, that same person that you thought was loyal and deserving and all that, you actually will now probably have a different label on them because you'll be expecting to do something that they procrastinate on, they hesitate on, they frustrate on. It's not important to them.
