 You can ask this question, how is working out and how is eating smart and wisely going to help me in what I currently have as my highest value? So let's say my highest value is building my business. Okay? So how is working out and fitness going to help me in my business and building my business? And how is eating wisely going to help me in my business? If I can't see how it's going to do it, I probably won't do it. But if I start to stack up the benefits and the reasons and how it will help me, the more I do it, more I link it to what is valuable to me, the higher the probability I'll do it. Cause I'm raising it up on my value list and whatever's highest on my value list is where I'm disciplined, reliable and focused. That's what I'll do.
