 Nobody goes to work for the sake of a company. They go to work to fulfill what their values are and what they need. So if you surround yourself with people that are not engaged, not inspired, not fulfilled, you're almost guaranteed to have high overheads, high bureaucracy, low returns. But if you actually surround yourself with the people that love doing what needs to be done and needs to be delegated, you have a higher probability of getting an outcome. So you want to make sure you surround yourself with people that are fully inspired and engaged by the vision of the company that meets those needs. You can't just pick somebody out of the blue and go, okay, I want to save some money. I'm going to hire this person to save some money. You need to make sure you get somebody who is, you can delegate something to that's going to get it done that you can rely on so you can get out and do the things that's most important in your value system.
