 The fantasy is an assumption that it's supposed to be ease without difficulty, pleasure without pain, positive without negative, in a world that has a magnet of both sides. So if you're striving for a one sided world and striving for that which is unavailable and trying to avoid that which is unavoidable, that's the source of human suffering as the Buddha said. Wisdom is embracing both sides of life and embracing them as part of the journey.
