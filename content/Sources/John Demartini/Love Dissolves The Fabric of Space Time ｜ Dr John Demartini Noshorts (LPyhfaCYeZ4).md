 that when you're kissing a girlfriend, two hours seems like two moments. When you're waiting for a freight train, two moments seems like two hours. When you see more pleasure than pain and more support of your values than challenge, what happens is you accelerate time and shrink space. And whenever you're seeing more pain and pleasure or challenge and support, you tend to elongate to space and increase time. So you stretch time out, you decelerate it if you will. So you're distorting the fabric of space time with your emotions. But love dissolves the fabric of space time and allows you ever present without boundary.
