 Well, every individual lives by a set of priorities, a set of values. And whenever they're setting intentions that are congruent and aligned with their highest value, the thing that's most important to them, the thing that they spontaneously are inspired from within to fulfill, the brain maximizes the microglia and the glial cell neuroplastic effect. So in other words, just like a tree that grows to the light, any branch that reaches to the light expands and empowers. And anyone that gets in the shade dies out. The brain is no different. Whenever you're doing something that truly is inspiring, that is meaningful, that's the highest priority, that area of the brain becomes myelinated, neurogenesis occurs, um, nutrification occurs to the cells, and all the other ones are by apoptotically are reduced and re and taken away. They're remodeled away. So the brain is remodeling itself to help you fulfill your life.
