 There's a correlation between this bullying response and our addiction to one side. Our amygdala wants to avoid pain and seek pleasure. If we're living in our inauthentic amygdala as a survival mechanism, we're going to want one piece without war, pleasure without pain. If we're living in our executive center, we are embracing it. I found out many years ago that if we pursue challenges that inspire us, we don't attract challenges that don't. So if you're tackling and pursuing a challenge that inspires you and embracing both sides and mitigating the risks and finding solutions to it, so you break the fantasies and pursue real objectives in life, you're less likely to be bullied. You're less likely to be challenged because you're empowering your life. Any area of your life you don't empower, people are going to overpower you.
