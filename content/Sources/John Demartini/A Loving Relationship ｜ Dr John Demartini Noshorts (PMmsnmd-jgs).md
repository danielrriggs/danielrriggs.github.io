 And that's the one that allows you to have a sustainable relationship. If you're in a relationship and you're wanting, and you're addicted to the idea that you want them to support you, not challenge, you want them to be nice, not mean, kind, not cruel, positive, not negative, peaceful, not wrathful. You have a fantasy about who they're going to be. And when they do that, you've got the superficial gratitude. When they don't, and they show the other side, which is inevitable, inevitable, then you're going to go, well, I'm now withdrawn. So this relationship's not working for me. And you're impulsively seeking the fantasy and avoiding the pain instinctually. But the second you embrace both sides simultaneously, you can now have a loving relationship.
