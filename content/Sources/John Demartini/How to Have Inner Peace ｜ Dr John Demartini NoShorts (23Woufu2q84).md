 Inner peace is different than outer peace. If you're looking for outer peace, you'll be searching for eternity and not getting anything but a fluctuating peace and war game. But inner peace is the realization. At the moment there's peace, where's the war? And where the moment there's war, where's the peace? Because maximum growth and development occurs at the board of support and challenge and peace and war. People have this fantasy, they're supposed to have peace all the time. You don't grow there. Cultures don't grow under peace. They grow and they stagnate. They grow under challenge. So if you're looking for one side and you're looking for peace, look for the other side in that moment. If you see both sides at the same time, you have inner peace. When you can see that both the challenges in your life serve you as much as the calm in your life, you'll find inner peace. If not, you'll be searching for outer peace your whole life and not get it but half the time and end up bipolar.
