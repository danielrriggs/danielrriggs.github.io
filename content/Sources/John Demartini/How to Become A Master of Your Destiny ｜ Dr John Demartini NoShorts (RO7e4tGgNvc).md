 By identifying what your life truly demonstrates is important to you and setting goals that are aligned with that, that's how you activate the great genius that you have inside. That's how you master your life. That's how you have inspired wisdom. Because wisdom sits inside the heart. And the second you're grateful for your life because you achieve what's important to you, your gratitude opens up the gateway of the heart and allows the love to when to wash your mind and allow the mind to have inspired ideas, which bring enthusiasm. When you're grateful for your life and you're doing what you love and you're inspired by your vision and you're enthusiastically working towards whatever it is that's meaningful to you, that your telos, your purpose in life, man, there's nothing stopping you. Everything is on the way, not in the way. Everything is instructive, not obstructive. You become a master of your destiny, not a victim of your history. You see things in a way on the way.
