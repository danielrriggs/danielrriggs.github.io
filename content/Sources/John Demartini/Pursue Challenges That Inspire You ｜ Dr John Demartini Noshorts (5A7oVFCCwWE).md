 When you're living by your highest values, you're actually pursuing challenges that inspire you. You're looking for challenges that inspire you. And the greater the challenges that you are inspired by that you want to solve and master, the greater your life. And the ones that are the ones that to solve are the ones that serve the greatest number of people. Not where people are just imposing on you what they want out of impulse, but actually things that truly serve their long-term objectives. Because the majority of people live with impulses and look for immediate gratification. Serving those impulses and immediate gratification is not the same as actually doing something that's going to help them evolve.
