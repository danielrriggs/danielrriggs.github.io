 There was a Greek philosopher named Epictetus who said, at first we blame others. Then as we evolve a little further we start blaming ourselves. And then when we finally become awake and we realize there's nothing to blame. So we have a tendency to want to hold onto our pride on the inside, therefore resist accountability and hold onto infatuations to avoid the challenges that we inevitably attract to break our addictions to the infatuations. If we're addicted to pleasure we attract pain. If we're addicted to protection we attract the violence. Whatever we're addicted to which keeps us juvenile dependent stops our growth and makes us in a sense weakened. We attract its opposite to make sure we grow because maximum growth and development occurs at the border of support and challenge.
