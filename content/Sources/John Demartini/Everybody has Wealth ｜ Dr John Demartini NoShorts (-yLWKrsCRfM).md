 Everybody has wealth. It's called general wealth. And it's in those areas I mentioned, but it may not be in financial wealth. I know people that work very, very hard and they put all their money back into their family and they've got a magnificent family and a beautiful home and a great lifestyle, but they have no financial wealth. I know many people go and continue to go to seminars and educating themselves and growing knowledge. They have intellectual property wealth, but they don't have any financial wealth.
