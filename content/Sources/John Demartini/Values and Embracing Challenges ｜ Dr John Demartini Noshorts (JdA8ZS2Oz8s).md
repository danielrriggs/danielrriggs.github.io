 Anytime we're doing things that are lower on our values, we tend to activate a hedonistic pathway in the brain that looks for a pleasure without a pain. Now this shows up as avoiding challenge, seeking ease, seeking support, avoiding difficulty, seeking ease, avoiding criticism, seeking praise. So actually our animal nature is wanting pride, not shame. Peacefulness without war. When we live by our highest values, we embrace peace and war, support and challenge, ease and difficulties together. We're looking for challenges that inspire us. We're living by lower values. We're trying to avoid the challenges and seek to ease. And therefore the challenges we attract that we're trying to avoid become distressful because we're holding onto a fantasy of a one-sided world.
