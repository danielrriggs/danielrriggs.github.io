 My observation is that our problems don't get easier in life. Our problems get more profound and our solutions get more profound. And this is what awakens our consciousness. And AI is going to be both a pleasure and a pain along the pathway. And we will regulate it and it will regulate us and it will give us feedback and we'll give it feedback and we'll work as a team to do something amazing with this technology. And you know, it's hard to imagine in 1900, where we are today. A hundred years from now, this is going to be like the Model T. Hard to comprehend, but a hundred years from now, this AI will be the Model T. And we'll think, Oh, it's not even a factor today. What we were worried about is insignificant. I always say, as Bucky Fuller says, that pollution is future solution. Everything we think is terrible today, we have a solution for tomorrow and we'll come up with the next step. And I feel confident that that's going to happen because I've been watching it since the two, three hundred years now, watching the doomsday predictions, and they all pass by.
