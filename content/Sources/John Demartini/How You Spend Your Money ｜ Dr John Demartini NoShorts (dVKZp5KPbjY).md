 You spend your money according to your values. The hierarchy of your values dictates your financial destiny. So tell me what you value most. I'm going to show you where your money's going to go. So you have to have a value on not immediate gratification for consumables, but long-term focus. You want to build a brand around yourself instead of keep living off other people's brands, which make you spend their money on their brands instead of them spending money on your brand.
