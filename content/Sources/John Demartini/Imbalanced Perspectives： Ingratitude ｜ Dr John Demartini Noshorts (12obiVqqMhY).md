 When we have these imbalanced perspectives and we put something on a pedestal, we in a sense minimize ourselves and we want to change ourselves relative to them. If we are self-righteous and we're seeing something we resent, we want to change that relative to us. And whenever we're changing something, ourselves relative to something, or changing something relative to us, we're ungrateful for the way it is. So anytime we have an imbalanced perspective, we don't have gratitude. We have ingratitude and we want change. The second we have a balanced perspective and we see that that which we see is a reflection of ourselves, the seer of the seeing and the seeing of the same. Then we have a balanced orientation, we have gratitude. And when we do, our physiology goes into wellness and wholeness.
