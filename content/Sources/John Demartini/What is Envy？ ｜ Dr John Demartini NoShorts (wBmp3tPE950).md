 Envy is when you are perceiving something in somebody else that you think that you admire, that you assume they have, but you're too humble to admit you have. It's not that you're missing it. You're not honoring and recognizing it in yourself. So you assume they have something you don't. So you therefore minimize you, exaggerate them, and envy what they have, because you think they have a better deal than you do.
