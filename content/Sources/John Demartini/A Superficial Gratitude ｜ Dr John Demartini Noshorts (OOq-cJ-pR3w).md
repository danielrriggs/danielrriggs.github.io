 There's two types of gratitude. There's a superficial gratitude when somebody does something that supports your values and you say, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. That's easy to be grateful superficially when you feel that we're being supported. This is what I call an amygdala driven gratitude. It's a subcortical layer of the brain that is being supported. It's like in the subcortical layer of the brain, this amygdala, this limbic portion of the brain is involved in survival. And so it wants to seek food, prey, and wants to avoid predator. It wants to eat to sustain itself. It doesn't want to get eaten to annihilate itself. So when you see prey, it's easy to be grateful because you sustain. So this is a superficial gratitude. It's an amygdala based gratitude that when you get what you want.
