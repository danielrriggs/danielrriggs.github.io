 If you set goals that are aligned and congruent with what you truly value, you spontaneously are inspired intrinsically to take action on them. And you have the highest probability of achieving them. And you have the highest awareness factor because of the filtering of the information that allows you to achieve it. So you literally feel like you're working in the flow when you're living by that highest value. So there is a synchronicity there. And your inner most dominant thought does become your outer most tangible reality because it's highest on your value, because it's the way the brain is set up.
