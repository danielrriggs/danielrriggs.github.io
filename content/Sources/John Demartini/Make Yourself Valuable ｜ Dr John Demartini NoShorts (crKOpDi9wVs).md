 Each individual lives by a set of priorities, a set of values. And whatever's highest is where they're most empowered and whatever's lowest is where they're lower empowered. But there is ways and there are tools to empower all of them. And what I've asked is thousands of people, when they're looking for a mate, particularly women, when they're looking for men, they're looking for somebody that's empowered physically, that's attractive, that's healthy, that's vital. They're looking for somebody that it's intelligent. They're looking for somebody that's ambitious. They're looking for somebody that has some resources, looking for somebody that wants to have a family and that wants to be able to communicate effectively and not dominate or be underdog. They want somebody that has influence and social influence that can get along with people and have a community effect. And they want somebody that's inspired. Everybody is looking for somebody empowered in all areas. So if we empower all areas, we're more valuable on the market, you might say, not only in our relationships, but all areas. And any area that we don't empower, they can undermine the other powers.
