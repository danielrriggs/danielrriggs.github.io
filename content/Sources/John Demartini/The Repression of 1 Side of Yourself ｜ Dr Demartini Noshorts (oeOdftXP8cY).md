 The pursuit of one side is going to be self-defeating. Anytime we try to repress the side of ourselves and try to express only one side, eventually the repression explodes. And we eventually download a major outlet of all that stuff we've repressed. So I don't find that productive. I'm not interested in repressing half ourself and getting rid of half yourself to love yourself. I'm interested in loving both sides of yourself and loving both sides of others. If I ask people, how many of you believe that they're nice and never mean and kind, never cruel, and positive, never negative, and peaceful, never wrathful, and generous, never stingy, nobody can put their hand up and say I'm that way all the time. If I say that to you, you're always mean, never nice, they can also say I'm not that way either. But if I say, sometimes you're nice, sometimes you mean, sometimes you're kind, sometimes you're cruel, sometimes you're positive, sometimes you're negative, everybody goes, yup, that's me. So why would you have an expectation on somebody to be one sided when in fact, life has both sides?
