 So the magnitude of the challenge and the problem that you're willing to tackle will determine the results that you get. And so sometimes people, young entrepreneurs, when they're starting out, have a neat idea. They project that onto other people, what they think the world needs without actually finding out whether the world needs it. The world doesn't need it. They're fighting uphill trying to sell something to a group of people that don't feel that they need something. And they're presumptive and projective of their values onto the world instead of finding out what the world needs and meeting those needs. People that are the billionaires are meeting vast needs and they're caring enough about humanity to find what those needs are and then serving those needs in a way that they're inspired to serve.
