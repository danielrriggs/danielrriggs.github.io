 If you don't govern yourself from the inside, you become governed from the outside. One, you're a master, the other you're a slave. I'd much rather govern myself from the inside and before I go into extremes. Your intuition is attempting to bring your unconscious conscious to balance out the equation, to liberate you from the bondages of all the emotions that distract you, and stay centered on the thing that's your inspired mission. Take no credit, take no blame, just keep focused on the chief aim. The name of the game is thank you, I love you.
