 Because people think they have a value on something, but their life doesn't demonstrate it. Your life demonstrates your values. And if you don't have savings in place, you're not serving people, making a profit, saving a portion of it, investing a portion of it, accumulating it, then you don't have a value on wealth building. You have a value on spending your money the second it comes in on things that depreciate and go down in value, liabilities, many. So many people have a fantasy that they have a value on wealth building, but they don't. And many people have a fantasy about what they're going to do, but it's not really their value. And those people that set a goal on those fantasies think, well, the secret's not working, the law of attraction is not working, et cetera. I don't see these opportunities. I don't see synchronicities, et cetera. It's not high on their values. They just fantasize that it was high on their values. But when it's really high on their values, they see opportunity and they see opportunities around them.
