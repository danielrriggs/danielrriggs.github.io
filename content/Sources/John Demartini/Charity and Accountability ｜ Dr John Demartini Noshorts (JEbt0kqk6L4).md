 Never give money to somebody without an education and without them knowing that they have responsibilities to do something with that that's accountable. Or otherwise they'll be dependent and asking again and again and again, and they'll eventually resent you when you stop just to teach you the lesson, make them accountable. You build, you build culture that way, not to entitled societies and entitled societies decay. So a charity is to be done, um, in a way where it's making true productivity out of people. Otherwise it's not charity. It's, it's a destruction of the society.
