 When you're living according to this highest value and living literally by priority, the blood glucose noxious goes into the forebrain, activates the medial prefrontal cortex, the executive center, they call it. And this according to Scientific American is like the seat of the self. It's the seat of integration of all the fractures, all the fragmentations that we have. It's where we have the most integration of interneurons in the brain. And we have the most, you might say summary of who we are. So if we live by priority, we increase the probability of living authentically and we have the greatest potential to know who we are.
