 A perfectly equilibrated mind is what opens the heart. And so you can't have the heart without the mind being in wisdom. So they're one and the same. As Swedenborg, the visionary, the mystic said, the sun gives light to the world, but the light is the wisdom and the warmth is the heart. And that's the love of the sun. And I say, if you want to be an enlightened sun, a star in the world, then you have to have the wisdom and love. They're inseparable. I don't see them as separable.
