 So if we use our subcortical area, we are more in survival. If we are using our executive center and our forebrain, we are in survival, not survival. And depending on which one you use, we'll determine what the brain does. If you're in survival, it stops the development of the forebrain. If it, if it's in thrival, it calms down and governs the subcortical area of the brain. So we evolve when we're actually centered in balance. We basically survive when we're in an imbalanced states. So if we keep having perceptions that are imbalanced and bias and misinformation about our reality, then we keep kind of stagnating in animal reactions of avoid and seek. And we don't really evolve with reason and objectivity and keep advancing.
