 Every decision you make is based on what you believe consciously or unconsciously is going to give you the greatest advantage over disadvantage. Now, when I first say that, many people say, well, I don't choose to do this action and I'm trying to stop it. And I confront them and say, no, consciously or unconsciously, you are perceiving that there's more advantage than disadvantage in doing that behavior or you wouldn't be doing it. No one's going to keep doing a behavior unless they get some advantage out of it.
