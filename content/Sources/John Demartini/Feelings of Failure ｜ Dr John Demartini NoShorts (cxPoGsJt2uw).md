 The number one thing that makes self depreciation, feelings of failure, is pursuing things that aren't really important. And you'll end up beating yourself up because you don't really stay the course to get the job done. But if you go do the value determination process and you find out what's really highest in priority and you start prioritizing and living by highest priorities, your perception of failure or feelings of perception of failure go down. And if you do have something of failure, whatever it is, since it's feedback, you could ask yourself how specifically is doing whatever I experience, whatever the challenges were, whatever that I thought was a failure, how did it still help me move one step closer towards what I want? That's why knowing what your highest value is crucial, because that way you stay on priority. And if you do sidetrack and go on lower priorities and feel like a failure, you can ask how is it still helping me get there?
