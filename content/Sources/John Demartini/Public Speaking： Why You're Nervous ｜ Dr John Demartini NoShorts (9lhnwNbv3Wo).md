 Anytime you're about to present something that you think in any way, whether it's true or not, but you believe that the people in the audience have more than you as far as experience or knowledge in the area that you're speaking about, you have a natural tendency to want to subordinate to that and put them on a pedestal and put you in the pit. In the process of doing it, you'll compare yourself to them instead of actually share the message that's in your heart.
