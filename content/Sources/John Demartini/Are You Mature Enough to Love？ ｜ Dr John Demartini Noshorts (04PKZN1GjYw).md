 So I'm a firm believer that it's wiser to look for both sides of things, try to find the middle. I always say that love is a synthesis and synchronicity of these so-called good and bads. It's the both. When you love somebody, you're going to find out that they do things you like and dislike, things you label good and bad, things you think are right and wrong, things that support and challenge you. If you're going to love, if you're going to be mature enough to love, you're going to be able to embrace both of those sides in yourself and the people you care about. So beware of immoral hypocrisies, beware of labeling people, beware of those mythologies about them. Because sometimes we go and we label somebody and then a day a week, a month, a year, five years later, we find out that they were the catalyst to our greatness. And then we look back and go, wow.
