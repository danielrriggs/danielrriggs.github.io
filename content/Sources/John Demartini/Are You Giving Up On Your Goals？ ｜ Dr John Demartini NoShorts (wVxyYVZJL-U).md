 If you're seeing things in the way and you're looking for an easy path, and if it's not easy then you give up, then it's not important to you. When something's really, really, really, really, really important to you, you don't stop. You get back up and come up with a more efficient way and you get one step closer every single day towards your goal. So when the Y is big enough, the house take care of themselves.
