 We live in sort of a hedonistic pill for every ill, kind of a allopathic approach to care. And the second we don't feel good, we want to take a pill. We want to, we want to feel good all the time. But actually, let me give you an example. Let's say you overeat, you really pig out and you binge one night and you wake up the next morning, you've got a puffy face, you've got snot, you've got gas and bloat and cramps and pain, and you feel awful and fatigued. These symptoms are physiological responses from overeating that are actually healthy responses to let us know, let you know that you pigged out. But if you cover it up and take an antacid and antiflaxolone and antihistamine and anti this, and you get rid of all the symptoms and you don't get the feedback, you're actually shutting down the very thing that's needed for your wellness. And you don't learn the lessons that the body's trying to give you.
