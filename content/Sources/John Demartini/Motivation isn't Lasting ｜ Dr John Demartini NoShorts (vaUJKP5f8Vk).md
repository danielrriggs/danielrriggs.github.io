 If you want your life to be inspired and flowing and not having to be pushed from the external source, which is transit, not lasting, then you have to realize that every human being lives by a set of priorities, a set of values, things that are most important to least important. Therefore it is intrinsically turned into action where otherwise things that are low on the values, you have to be motivated to do.
