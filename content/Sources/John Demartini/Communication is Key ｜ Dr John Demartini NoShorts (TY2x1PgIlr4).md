 If you want to have the art of communication, you want to care enough about another individual to find out what they value, find out how it serves you. Because if you don't see how their values and what they're dedicated to serving you, you're going to talk down to them. And when people feel talked down to, they shut down and they withdraw. And then they get challenged, and they get attacked and they want to talk down to you. That doesn't work. But if you actually find out how what they do serves you and what you do serves them, you have a higher probability of alternating monologues turned into dialogues.
