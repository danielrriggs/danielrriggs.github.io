 Inside our own nature, I've asked literally millions of people, if you were to go inside, how many of you have moments of inner calmness and they all put their hands up? How many of you have moments of inner turmoil? They all put their hands up. How many of you, no matter how hard you tried, have a combination of both going back and forth? They put their hands up. And then when they get married, how many of you notice that there's still cooperation and competition? There's peaceful moments and warful moments. And there's times of calm and times of turmoil. And then when they have children, there's times of turmoil and times of calm. And then when they get with their friends, there's times of turmoil and calm. And I see that nature has both. Build and destroy, union and division, the law of similarities and differences, cooperation, competition, even peace and war. So to try to stamp it out, I think, is ignorance of the nature of our own nature.
