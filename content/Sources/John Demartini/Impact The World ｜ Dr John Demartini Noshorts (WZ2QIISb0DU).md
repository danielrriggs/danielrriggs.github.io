 Some people think small and they live moment to moment, hour to hour. Some people think a little bigger, day to day, week to week. Some think in terms of month and years. Some decades and generations. And others centuries, millenniums or eternity. You create at whatever level you give yourself permission to. The magnitude of space and time within your innermost dominant thought determines the level of your impact across the world.
