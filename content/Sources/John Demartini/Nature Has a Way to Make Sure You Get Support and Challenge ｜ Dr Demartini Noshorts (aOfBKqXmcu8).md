 Whenever somebody supports you, you tend to subordinate to them. You tend to inject their values. You try to live in their values to please them for fear of loss of them because you're dependent on them. But at the same time, when somebody challenges you, you become independent and you stand on your own two feet and think for yourself. So nature has a way to make sure you get support and challenge, you know, the over protector and the over bullier. And if you get an addiction, if you get addiction to the over protection, you're going to get the aggressor. If you get addicted to the person that's praising you and you want to have support and praise all the time, you're going to get the person that's criticizing and challenging you. The support and praise makes you proud and build yourself up and makes you inauthentic. And the other one brings you back down again to bring you back inauthentic. And you're basically addicted to one. So the other one hurts.
