 I got introduced to meditation, alpha meditation, in 1972. I then studied a variety of forms of meditation. In 1975, I studied TM meditation with Maharishi. I had many different Indian gurus that I came across over the years that taught different forms of meditation. I learned a little of everything that I could. I studied the physiology of what the mind does, the breathing mechanisms. They all have a place. As long as you're using it for integration and not escape. Because some people, and I've seen it at many locations that I've lectured at, where people are going there as a meditation to escape the world instead of to find the magnificence inside the world. So what sometimes we go, oh, I'm stressed, I need to go meditate. Instead of actually meditating and finding the hidden order in what you thought was stress.
