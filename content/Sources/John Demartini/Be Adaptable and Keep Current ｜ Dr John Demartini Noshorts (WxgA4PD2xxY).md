 Don't assume that what was working in the past is going to continue to work in the future and be adaptable and keep current. That's to your advantage to keep as much advice and update on what's happening out there so you're not left behind and you're adapting as efficiently as you can. But don't get angry at change and evolution to technology. It's going to be with us and we're not going to stop. And technological advances in society is what gives it advantage. If you look at the underdeveloped parts of the world, it's not technologically advancing as well and it's living in a third world environment. So if you like the luxuries of the first world environment, be grateful for the technology and let's use it wisely, but not be frightened about it. Let's just use it wisely and adapt. There will be disruptive jobs. Some will be gone. New jobs will come about, new technologies. Anytime something comes in, there'll be new innovations that will be coming along with it. Focus on what you can be of service. If you care about human beings and serving them, you'll find how to use the technology at your advantage.
