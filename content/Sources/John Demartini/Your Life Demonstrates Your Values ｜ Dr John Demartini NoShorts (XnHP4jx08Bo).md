 Many times we have injected the values of others into our life and attempted to be somebody we're not. And this is almost guaranteed to be self-defeating. There's wisdom in extracting wisdom from other people and not reinventing wheels and standing on the shoulders of giants and mentors. It's unwise to basically try to be somebody you're not. This happens a lot. Everybody has a unique set of values and their life demonstrates those values and identifying how what their values really are is the first starting point. How do they fill their space? What do they spend their time on? What is it that they're energized by that energizes them? What is it that they spend their money on most? What is it that they're most organized in and where are they most disciplined in their life? What do they think about, visualize, and affirm inside their internal dialogue to themselves about most that's coming true? What do they love conversing with other people about most? What is it that inspires them or common to what people, the people inspire them? What is it that they have that's a persistent goal that they're achieving and what is it they love learning about? Those value determinants give a better articulate idea of what's really valuable to them. Once they determine what their real values are, they can either set goals to match their values or they can change their values to match their goals.
