 There is a science of how to take the mind into equilibrium and see the order and open the heart. The heart automatically opens when the mind is in balance. But as long as the mind is imbalanced, it will have emotions that will close the heart. Love is not an emotion. It's a synthesis and synchronicity of all complementary opposite emotions. The moment you see the complementation synchronously and synthesize them, out comes gratitude and love every time. So there's a science to it.
