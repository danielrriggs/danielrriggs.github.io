 Well, gratitude isn't love is that perfect equanimity point. It's poised, not poisoned. When you're in equanimity, you have poise, presence, power, purpose, priority, productivity. And when you're not, you're oscillating with vicissitudes. And we have moments like that, we all do, but I mitigate the extremes, because I found that extreme elation or extreme depression is a bipolar state. I'd rather be centered and rather be focused and in prioritized. And I do keep a record of my gratitude, but I find that my gratitude only occurs not when I'm up. My gratitude occurs when I see the hidden order in the pairs of opposites at the same time.
