 Many people are, because of the comparisons, are not conscious of what their real values are and don't realize why they keep doing what they do that's actually fulfilling those highest values. And then they have fantasies and unrealistic expectations that they're going to live outside those values. And they have these ideals about, oh, I want to be doing this. I see this in financial independence. I asked a whole audience, 10,000 people, how many of you want to be financially independent? Everybody puts a hand up. Yeah. 0.3 to 0.8% of the room actually obtain it. So what they think they want and what they actually are demonstrating in their behaviors are two different things.
