 So the Demartini Method, which I've been teaching all these decades, is designed to help a coach, a counselor, a therapist, break through the limits that people have. And most of those, every time we have imbalanced perceptions and ratios of perception, we store that in our subconscious mind, which is our amygdala and our hippocampus. It runs and reverberates and shows up as impulses and instincts that fire off before we can even think. It puts us in the lower subcortical area where we're in systems one thinking, where we're basically reacting with forethinking, instead of following with proactive thoughts, a real plan, living by design. We're living by reactions. So the method can help you help clients break through the drama, the emotional baggage that's holding them back, so they can start to see life on the way, not in the way.
