 If you had very little education, it's very easy to be told what to think. If you have no business savvy of your own, where you want to start as an entrepreneur in your own business, you'll probably be told what to do and what you're worth. If you don't have any business or financial savvy, you'll probably end up on social security, which is just barely enough to get by. And if you don't understand relationships, you'll have some statistics become part of your life. And if you don't empower yourself as a leader, you'll be told what to think and how to live. And if you don't do something with your health and no one understands your health, you'll probably be having a drug and maybe even have an organ removed. And if you don't inspire yourself, you'll probably subordinate yourself to a cultural dogma that you may never even question. Any area of your life that you're not empowered in, you're very easily overpowered in.
