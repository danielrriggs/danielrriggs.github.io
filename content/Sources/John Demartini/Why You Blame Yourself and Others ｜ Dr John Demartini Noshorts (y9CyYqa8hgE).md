 If we understand that I'm not a nice person, I'm not a mean person, I'm a human being. And if you support my values, I can be nice to you. If you're nice as a pussycat, if you challenge my values, I can be mean as a tiger. If you had an objective view and you understood that I'm just a human being with both potentials for nice, mean, both personas, then you have a realistic expectation. You're less likely to be let down when I give you both sides. But if you have a fantasy that I'm supposed to be one side or you're supposed to be one side, and then the other side comes up, you then blame yourself or blame other people because you have an expectation that's one-sided and skewed and the other side has to be there because it's like two poles of a magnet. You can't get a one-sided magnet. So nature automatically brings both sides.
