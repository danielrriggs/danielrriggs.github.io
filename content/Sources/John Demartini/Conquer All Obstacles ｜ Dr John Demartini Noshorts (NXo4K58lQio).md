 I always say certainty conquers all obstacles. And when you're clear and you have a state of knowing, you just transcend all the resistance that's there because you turn into an opportunity. Because it's not what happens to you. It's how you perceive it. And if I go through my life and my journey, if I was to stop every time I got resistance, instead of using it as a feedback mechanisms, I wouldn't be where I am today. So I basically look at that resistance as an opportunity. And I always look for where the equal and opposite assistance is because together, along the pursuit, a resistance and assistance is always paired. And they're both necessary. They're both feedback mechanisms to help us become more, in a sense, refined and clear on our objective.
