 You want to fill your day with the highest priority actions you can. And then if you're not taking the time to plan life out, I assure you, life is going to distract you. It really does pay off to close to book your life, to plan out how you want. I keep a very busy schedule because I find it when I keep a very busy schedule, I don't get distracted as much. I delegate everything off my plate. When something comes in and tries to distract, I just send it over to somebody else. I learned to do that. And people say, well, that's because, well, you're wealthy and you've done this and everything else. I became wealthy because I did it. I didn't have the wealth to start. I started doing that and my wealth came to me because I started prioritizing. When you do what you really love to do and you can't wait to get up and do it, people can't wait to get your service. But if you're doing distractions and putting fires out and letting other people run your life, then you're probably not going to be as fulfilled or inspired as productive and not have as much meaning in life. You decide what's meaningful. You're the one that decides how you want your life. You're the captain of your ship and master of your fate.
