 I'm a firm believer in getting your mind back into balance. So you're more adaptable and resilient. When you're highly polarized, you're very rigid and black and white, and you don't want to change. And you fight the inevitable. But when you're actually resilient and adaptable, you go, okay, this is happening. Now how do I use it to my greatest advantage? One of the greatest questions you'll ever ask is how is whatever's happening out there, how is it helping me fulfill my mission? And if you're on a mission to be of service to people, you'll find out how to use it to your advantage. And there'll always be advantages and disadvantages to everything, just like in relationships, just like every action that ever happens in the world. As Milton said, you can make a heaven out of a hell or a hell out of a heaven. Thinking makes it so. So I think that that's the key to be able to go through and be resilient.
