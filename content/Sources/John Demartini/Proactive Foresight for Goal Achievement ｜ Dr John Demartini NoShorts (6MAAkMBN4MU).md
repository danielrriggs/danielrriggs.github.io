 When you're setting a goal that is aligned and congruent with what you value most, which will easily be demonstrated in your daily actions, because tell me what you do every day and I'll tell you what you value. If you set a goal that matches that, that you spontaneously are inspired to get up and do and do it, you'll embrace pleasure and pain equally in equal quantities with objective reason towards that objective. Intelligent individuals who set goals, don't set up fantasies and try to avoid all negatives. What they do is they think out the goal, they know there's going to be challenges and obstacles and things to go through to get there. And they set up contingency plans for each of those obstacles and see that so when it comes, they're proactive, not reactive. And they, they get their goal, they increase the probability of getting a goal. I don't have anybody that's achieved incredible things that didn't put contingency plans in place in preparation. They have foresight, not reactive with hindsight.
