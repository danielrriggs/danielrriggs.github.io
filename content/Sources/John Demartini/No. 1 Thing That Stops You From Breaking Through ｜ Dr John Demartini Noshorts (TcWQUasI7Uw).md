The fear of not being smart enough, the fear of not being successful and failure, the fear of not having wealth or losing money, the fear of not having a relationship or losing relationship, the fear of not having connections and social connections and losing of people's support, and the fear of ill health, death or disease, or not having health, or the fear of not being inspired and feeling down and depressed.
