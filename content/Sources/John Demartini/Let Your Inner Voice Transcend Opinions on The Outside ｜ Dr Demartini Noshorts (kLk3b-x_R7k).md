 It's part of our innermost and deepest soulful nature to have a clear intent. What we do is we go through our lives and we have all these emotional distractions, things we get infatuated with, things that we get resentful to, things that we're drawn to and away from, and we're letting the outer world, in a sense, cause us to react instead of our inner world causing us to clearly act. So it's in our inner nature to create, to actually manifest what's innermost in our minds. But what we do is we, in a sense, subordinate ourselves to perceived authorities, to obstacles, to challenges, and the people who are masters, the people who are leaders and achievers throughout history are the ones that let their own opinion and their own inner voice and their own inner vision transcend all opinions on the outside. As the great philosopher said, I'd rather have the whole world against me than my own soul.
