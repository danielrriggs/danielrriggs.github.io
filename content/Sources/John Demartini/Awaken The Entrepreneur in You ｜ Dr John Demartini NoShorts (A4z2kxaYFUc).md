 Is it possible to awaken the entrepreneur in every human being? Yes. I've definitely worked with people that you would never imagine to be an entrepreneur, found out what their highest value is, find out what the world needs, found out where they overlap and set up a prioritized action step for them to help them do that. And they get into motion and they were, they were not even entrepreneurs. They worked for stability and security at a company and or raised a family. And all of a sudden they got inspired by something and they took off. So is the, is the capacity inside everyone? Yes. Will they do it? Maybe not. If there's, if they apply the tools and principles that help them do it, they increase those odds for sure.
