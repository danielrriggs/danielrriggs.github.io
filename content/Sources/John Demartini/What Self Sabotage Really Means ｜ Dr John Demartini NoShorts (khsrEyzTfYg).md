 I don't find sabotage, I've heard the term sabotage, I don't find that a productive word because anytime somebody says that they're sabotaging, it means that they don't know what their real values are and they keep expecting to live outside their values in somebody else's values. And then they think, well, I can't seem to go and keep doing what I think is important and they keep going to what is important. Once they know what their real values are, they don't see themselves sabotaging, they see themselves making decisions according to their values and they go, no wonder I keep doing that. But when they have a fantasy of living outside their values, they can label themselves as sabotaging.
