 Most people have heard of the term wealth, but they've probably not dissected it down to find out the various forms of wealth. Most people think of wealth, they immediately think of finances. And that's one form of wealth. But actually genuine wealth is more broad and encompassing more areas of life than that. We have our mind development, our quest for waking up our genius. We have our business, to say it desires to grow a big business. We have our financial area where we want to grow financial independence. We have a family, we have our social causes and goals. We have our physical fitness and we have our spiritual quest, our existential quest. All those areas actually store a form of wealth.
