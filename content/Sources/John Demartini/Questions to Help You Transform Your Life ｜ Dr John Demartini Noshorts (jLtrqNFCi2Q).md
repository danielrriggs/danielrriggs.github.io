 You have the power to transform your perception of whatever's happening in your life and turn it on the way, not in the way. So you can be master of destiny. And one of the greatest questions you'll ask yourself is how is whatever I'm experiencing today, pleasureful or painful, ecstatic or traumatic, how's it helping me fulfill my mission? What I feel my calling in my direction, my highest value, what's most fulfilling to me? How's it helped me fulfill that? How's it helped me do what I love? How's it helping me make a fortune doing that? How's it helping me fulfill my life? How's it helped me find the one I love? How's it helping? If you ask those questions, your life turns into a meaningful pathway.
