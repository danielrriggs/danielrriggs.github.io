 The art of communication is foremost essential to be able to have a fulfilled life. Imagine you have children that you're going to communicate with, spouses, you're going to have people at work, employees, customers, you're going to have people of all different walks in your social life that you're going to be having a dialogue with and communicate. But a lot of miscommunication goes on because we make assumptions and we assume that people really understand us and we assume that we're listening.
