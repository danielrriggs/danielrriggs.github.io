 There are two types of heavens. The type of heaven that we fantasize about when we're looking for that which supports our values to keep us juvenile. And the type of heaven when we finally embrace that everything is in order and there's a balance of polarities and we're grateful for that balance because there's nothing to change. That heaven is embracing two sides. The first heaven is seeking one side. Now hell, on the other hand, is the idea that life is not matching our fantasy. We're frustrated because we're not getting our delusion and our addiction to our fantasy. Or it's the separation of the inseparables. It's the idea that we're supposed to get one side, happy without sad. So when we're striving for a one-sided life, life is hell because we can't get the two sides. And when we finally embrace both sides of life, we have heaven because now we're grateful. So I like to think of heaven as purely a state of gratitude for the balance of life that's inherent in life. And hell is the searching for one side and not appreciating the two sides of life.
