 Or if you know something you really want to be doing that you think will give you a greater return in far as fulfillment and income, ask how is the temporary job I have right now helping me get there? So you can appreciate it as a transition to the next step. There's no mistake while you're doing what you're doing. You obviously wouldn't be doing it if you didn't feel that there's some value out of it, financial security or connections or insights or skills or something you're developing. Appreciate what you've got, you get more to be appreciative of. So ask yourself, how is the current job duties and responsibilities and actions helping me fulfill my life and my highest values or the new career path that I want to take? And then your energy will be fused into that action and you'll end up with probably more opportunities within that job to make that transition.
