 So you always want to prioritize what you're doing and make sure you fill your day with high priority actions that inspire you instead of low priority distractions that don't. You can't live at the cutting edge with a new innovative idea, unless you're tackling bigger problems that challenge you, that inspire you. Because innovation comes from pursuing challenges and problems in the world that inspire you to want to tackle. That's where innovation comes. Well, if I'm doing low priority stuff, I'm preoccupied with all this trivial stuff instead of getting on with the most meaningful stuff. And so I'm more confident myself and more self worth and more income when I'm doing the high priority things that allow me innovation to keep at the cutting edge that keeps me innovating.
