 Every decision you make is based on what you believe will give you the greatest advantage over disadvantage, greatest reward over risk at any moment to what you value most. You're filtering your perceptions, you're filtering your decisions, you're filtering your actions according to what you value. The thalamus in the inner regions of the brain offers a gating filtering mechanism and according to our values and our glial cells the thalamus will literally transform what we perceive and if our highest value is raising a family if we walk in a mall we'll see children's items, but if our highest value is being an entrepreneur, we'll see business items. We'll filter our reality accordingly. Therefore the opportunities in our life will be an expression of our own values.
