 The next one is an unrealistic expectation on the collective society. Now you expect the world to be at peace without war and kind, without cruel and give, without take and generous and not stingy and considerate and not inconsiderate. But if you look, there's a law of heuristic escalation that says that whatever somebody is striving for, there's somebody playing the opposite role. You probably in your own family have a brother or sister that's like your antiparticle, that the behavior is completely opposite. The world is made out of complementary opposites. And for everything that's going on, there's somebody with an opposite view, pro-life, pro-abortion, pro-guns, anti-guns, pro-democratic, pro-Republican or whatever. They're, they're constantly having pairs of opposites.
