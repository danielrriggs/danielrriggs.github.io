 Every human being lives by a set of priorities, a set of values, things that are most to least important in their life. And you do this, your perceptions, your decisions, your actions, therefore your behavior is an expression of what those values are. Whatever is highest on your value, the very highest, you spontaneously are inspired to do that action. It's intrinsic. You feel in a sense called to do that. You don't have to be reminded or motivated or externally stimulated to get you to do that. And whatever's highest on your value, your identity revolves around, your purpose revolves around, and the air of your expertise revolves around. So whatever's highest on your value is really the path of your identity, who you are.
