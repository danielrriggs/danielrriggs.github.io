 I think that when people come up to you and say, oh, you're gifted, it's not really true. It's like Michael Ange, when they asked him how he did the great paintings, if you saw how much work I put into it, you wouldn't think it's so great. The real truth is it takes the mastery and the work of doing it and practicing it. You know, the difference between an amateur and a professional is one is practicing in between their performance, one's practicing at their performance. It's the willingness to have a purpose for doing so. If you really saw the significance of how mastery could help your life in the seven areas of life and you had it high enough on your values that there was nothing else more important, you would master it. But if you have other things that are more important, immediate gratifying pleasures that you seek or whatever, instead of mastery, then you won't myelinate that higher advanced part of the brain.
