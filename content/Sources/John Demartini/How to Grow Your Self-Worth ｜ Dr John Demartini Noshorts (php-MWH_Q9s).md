 Your self-worth is proportioned to how well you're congruent with your highest value. Because if you're living by lower values, you're devaluing yourself. You live by high values, you value yourself. And then you will, that's self-value. But other people's value, which is going to be paying you, you have to do something that fulfills their highest value. And you have to realize that you and they are reflections of each other. So if you negate them for you or negate you for them, you get symptoms and let you know that that's not working. But the second you see each other as reflections of each other and realize you're here to help them as you're helping you, you master the game.
