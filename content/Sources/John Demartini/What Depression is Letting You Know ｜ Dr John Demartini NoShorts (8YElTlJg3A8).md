 Depression is letting you know you've projected an unrealistic expectation. The same thing if you expect somebody to live in your values and not their values. And the same thing when you combine those, expecting to be one sided and live in your values. And you could also have it where you're expecting yourself to be one sided, or you're expecting yourself to live outside your own values and in somebody else's values, and a combination of those. Or you could also have an expectation on the world, the whole world to be one sided, always peaceful, never wrathful, always kind, never cruel. And now you're setting yourself up again for an unrealistic expectation, or expecting mechanical objects to read your mind, or other people to supposed to live the way you expect.
