 The family is not there for happiness. The family is there to teach you how to be authentic and embrace both sides of life and be resourceful and learning how to see the fullness and that there's nothing missing in abundance. How are you going to have a fulfilling life if you think things are missing and empty and you're having false expectations? And if you have, if you expect yourself to live in their values or you expect them to live in your values, you're going to have futility and a family dynamic is a spectrum of value systems. It doesn't work otherwise.
