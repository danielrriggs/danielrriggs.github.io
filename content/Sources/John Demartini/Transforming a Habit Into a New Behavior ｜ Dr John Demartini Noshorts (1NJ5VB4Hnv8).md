 We're going to have to find out what those unconscious motives are, find out the benefits of those, then find alternative ways of getting those benefits, stack up the advantages of doing that alternative until the advantages of that outweigh the advantages of the current behavior, and then stack up the drawbacks of the current behavior that you're wanting to change and stack up the drawbacks until that gets pain associated with it. And the other gets pleasure associated with it. And then your brain will move in the new direction. It'll stack up new associations, go in the new direction and epigenetically alter the nerves and alter the pathways, the synaptic pathways in the brain. So if you go through and stack up enough advantages of the viable alternative, one that you believe will give you an advantage, a new advantage, one that you would like to have, the new habit, if you will, great, stack it up. If you've got a big enough reason for doing it, you will. When the why is big enough, the hows take care of themselves. But if you don't have a big enough reason for doing it, you probably won't.
