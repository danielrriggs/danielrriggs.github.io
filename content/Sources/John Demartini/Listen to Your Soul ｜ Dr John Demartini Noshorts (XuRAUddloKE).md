 The first fear that stops you from acknowledging and emanating your purpose and your dream is the fear of breaking the morals and ethics of some spiritual authority, somebody you've given power to, subordinated to, other than your own soul. Albert Einstein said, my contempt for authority is what made me one. I stand in no one's shadows, but I stand on the shoulders of great giants. We often subordinate ourselves and minimize ourselves to people who we think have something that we don't. We're often too humble to admit our greatness, but greatness we have, and it is awaiting for us to acknowledge it.
