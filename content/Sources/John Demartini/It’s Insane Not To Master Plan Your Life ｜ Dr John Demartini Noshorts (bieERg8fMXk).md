 Imagine getting into a jet plane and the person that's flying the plane doesn't have a checklist, doesn't have a plan to make sure that these are the priorities that need to be done before we take off. If you don't, you have more problems, you might crash. So that's why they have a checklist. And the checklist is like a mini planning system. It's making sure that you've got all these things taken care of before you take off. In your life, before you take off in your life, if you want to do something extraordinary with your life, it's wise to have your checklist. And your checklist is the actions that are proven to achieve what it is you want, the things that are most effective and efficient in achieving the most outcomes. So taking the time to go through there and really planning out exactly how you want your life. I say start with what is it you would love to manifest in your life? How do I get handsomely and beautifully paid to do it? What are the highest priority action steps I can make that do to make that happen? What obstacles might I run into? How do I solve in advance? What worked? What didn't work today? How did I do it? How can I do it more effective and efficiently tomorrow? And how did, no matter what happened, how has it gotten one step closer to this objective?
