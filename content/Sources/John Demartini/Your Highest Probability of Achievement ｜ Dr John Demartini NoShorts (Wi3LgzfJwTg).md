 Each person has a set of priorities. Whenever they are setting goals and intentions that are congruent and aligned with the very highest value, they have the highest probability of doing what they say. They have the highest probability of seeing opportunity, making decisions quickly, and acting on those opportunities. And they have the highest probability of achievement. When they have achievement like that, they feel that they're creating their destiny.
