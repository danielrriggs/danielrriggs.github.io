 Gaining specialized knowledge in whatever that is, broad or narrow, is to your advantage. So you want to make that a daily habit. On a daily basis, you want to keep expanding your knowledge to new levels because that's how you help your business go to new levels. And you're going to get clients that match where you are. And since everybody else is growing, if you're not growing, eventually you fall backwards and entropy takes over your growth. So you definitely want to consistently make that a ritual, continued knowledge. And if it's really important to you, you would love to do that.
