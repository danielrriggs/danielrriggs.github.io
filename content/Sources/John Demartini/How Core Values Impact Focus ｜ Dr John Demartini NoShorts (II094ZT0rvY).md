 Every individual lives by a set of priorities, set of values in their life that are unique to them, things that are most important to least important to them. Whatever is highest on their value, they're spontaneously inspired from within to fulfill them. So they will naturally have a yearning and almost a calling to do that thing that's most important to them. But things lower on their values, they need outside motivation to keep them focused on it. It's not really that important to them. So they need either rewards if they do it or punishment if they don't, to keep focused on it.
