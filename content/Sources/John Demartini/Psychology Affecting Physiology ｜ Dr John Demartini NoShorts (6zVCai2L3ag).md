 If all of a sudden you've been challenged and you're angry and you speak out, your thyroid levels go up. If you hold and repress and you keep everything inside, your thyroid go down. That's why you'll see hypothyroids very listless and speech very little, and they're kind of gained weight and their thyroid function goes down because they're afraid to speak out. Where the hyperglycemic person is very usually outgoing, they're tactless, they basically say what they want to say, they don't worry what people think, they're more extroverted. So you can see the psychology affecting physiology.
