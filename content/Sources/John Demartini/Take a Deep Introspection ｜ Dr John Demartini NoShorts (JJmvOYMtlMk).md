 because I want you to look inside your own life and take a deep inspection, introspection, reflection of all the magnificent things that are necessary in your life that are actually on the way that you may not have seen. And just know that anyone you don't see on the way, that you see in the way is holding you back. But anything you see on the way is fueling you and no friction, but fuel. And I believe that inspiration and enthusiasm and uncertainty and presence and gratitude and love, these, these transcendental feelings are confirmations that you're perceiving things in a way that's helping you fulfill what's really meaningful to you.
