 What people say when they want to be financially independent, most of them in their mind, they're conjuring up the fantasy of living the lifestyles of the rich and famous. And they're used to spending money on things instead of actually investing money in things that are assets that go on appreciate in value. So unless they have a higher value on buying things that appreciate in value, and they keep having a value on buying consumables that depreciate in value, they can't get ahead financially. And they keep wondering, why? Why am I doing wrong? It's their values underneath that are making them make decisions that are leading them to do things that don't lead to financial results.
