 And the law of nature is that it always oscillates between the one and many. The second you strive towards the oneness and find the similarities and unification of all things, there's a natural tendency to then have the desire to see the manyness and the diversities and the differences. It's like if you get involved and you move to a new community and you want to be part of the community. You want to be one with them and join in with them. But the second you join in with them, then you have a desire to stand out and have your uniqueness. But if you get too far in uniqueness and too different, then you have a desire to unite again. So this oscillation between the one and the many is one of the greatest universal laws and applies in our own being. Even in our concepts of theology, from the one great divinity comes many personas and human beings. And out of the many human beings are strivings back to the unity of divinity.
