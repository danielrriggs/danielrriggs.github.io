 In reality, many people are going around thinking, I keep making mistakes. I keep screwing up. I keep having limited beliefs. I keep having sabotage. I keep, you know, not being focused. I asked in 1980s, I asked many, many groups that I was speaking to to write down the number one question you'd like to have addressed in this presentation. And it's just to gather data to see what people are interested in. And believe it or not, one of the most common things in the 1980s that I found was how do I stay focused? Many people are trying to live in other people's values and then wondering why they can't stay focused and they're not disciplined and they're not staying on track. And that's because they're trying to live in somebody else's values and trying to be somebody they're not instead of being who they are. And this is very common.
