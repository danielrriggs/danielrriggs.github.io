 If you're buying assets, that could be shares in companies, it could be building companies or buying companies, it could be buying real estate and rental properties, or you could be trading possible things and putting some of that aside into these other forums. But if you're not actually buying assets that actually start to work for you, you'll be working your whole life for money. And there's nothing wrong with that. There's no moral issue that you'll have wealth in these other forums, but you may not have financial wealth.
