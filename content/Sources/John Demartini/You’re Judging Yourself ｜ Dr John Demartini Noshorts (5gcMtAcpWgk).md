 Whenever we judge something on the outside that's positive or negative, it's because we're too humble or too proud on the inside to admit we have that and we do that same thing. You know, as Romans 2, the New Testament that made a statement that whatever you judge in others, you do the same things. And that's true. I've seen that in thousands and thousands of cases in the Breakthrough Experience. People judge people for things, and then they don't realize it's them they're judging ultimately. Whatever they resent in people on the outside is a shame, a thing that they're ashamed of on the inside, things they admire in somebody on the outside, the thing that they admire on the inside and they're proud of on the inside. And as long as you're proud or ashamed, you're exaggerating and minimizing who you are. And as long as you're infatuated or resentful to others, you have an imbalanced idea who they are. And therefore you're not authentic, and you're not allowing them to be authentic. And there you create symptoms and biochemical imbalances in the brain to let you know that. The imbalances in the brain are not illness, they're feedback mechanisms to let you know that you don't have a balanced perspective.
