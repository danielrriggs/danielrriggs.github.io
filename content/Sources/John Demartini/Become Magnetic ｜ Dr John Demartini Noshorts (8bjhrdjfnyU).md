 In order to magnetize and have charisma, it's actually having sustainable fair exchange in doing something you're inspired and enthused to do that's meaningful, that is authentic, that you want to contribute as a vision and mission for the planet, for people at whatever scale, and doing it in a way that really fulfills theirs and their desire to empower those areas in their life. If you help other people empower any or all of those areas of your life, I guarantee you, they'll be drawn, they'll be drawn to you. Magnetized you. So you want to ask yourself what specific trait, what specific action you can do that can be fulfilling to other people. If you go and communicate what you would love to do that with whatever it is that they would love to have, love to receive, their dominant buying motive, if you will, they'll be magnetized to you. And they'll label you a charismatic because you're enthused about what you're doing.
