 In the Demartini Method, I ask people, when somebody does something you resent and you feel you're a victim of, I go, okay, go to a moment where and when I perceive myself displaying or demonstrating the same behavior and own that and go find out where you've done it. At first you're going to say, I don't do that. I pride myself on never being that way. But I've been doing this on thousands and thousands of people. And I assure you that whatever you see in others, you have. And once you identify it, you realize that the only reason you're resenting somebody on the outside is reminding you of something you're feeling ashamed on the inside. And once you go and identify it and then go find out how do what they do serve you. Because there's no downside without an upside. Any behavior out there in the world that happens, if it didn't serve human beings, it would go extinct in evolution. But it's there and it serves.
