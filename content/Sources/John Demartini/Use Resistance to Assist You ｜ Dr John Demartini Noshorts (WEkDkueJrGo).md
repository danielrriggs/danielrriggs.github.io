 The master, as they pursue their dreams, realizes whether they are supported or challenged. Both are necessary for their objectives. So they don't see challenge as resistance. They see it as something that strengthens their determination and their will and gives them new creative ways to accomplish. So the master is the one who is able to see both sides, whether supportive or challenging, as necessary feedback mechanisms to accomplish what they aim. So it's not so much that you're forcing through resistance, you're using resistance to assist you.
