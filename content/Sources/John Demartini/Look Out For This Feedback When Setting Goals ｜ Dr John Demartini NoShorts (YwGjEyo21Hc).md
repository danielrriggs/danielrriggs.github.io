 One of the signs of having a fantasy is that you end up having internal anger and aggression. You tend to blame and feel like you betray yourself and sabotage. You tend to criticize and challenge yourself. You feel disparate and depressed. You want to escape and exit your life. You feel frustrated and grouchy. The ABCDEFGs of negativity are a symptom of setting a goal that's not really high on your value. And then having the repercussions as a feedback to let you know you're not being authentic on your objectives.
