 People ask me all the time, they go, what do you do to chill out? Chill out from what? You don't need to chill out when you're doing something you love doing. People who are doing something they really love to do can do it 18 hours a day and not even think about it. They don't feel like it's even stressful. They're actually in the youth stress state where they're building their vitality out of it. But if a person's doing something that is not inspiring to them and they try to do that 18 hours, they have heart attacks because they're unfulfilled in what they're doing. And anytime you're not fulfilling your highest values, you're increasing the probability of addictive compulsive behavior because it's a compensation for unfulfilled highest values. So it's a key is finding out what you value most and sticking to that.
