 See one of the greatest questions you can ask once you determine the values of them and yourself is how specifically is what they're dedicated to, their highest values, what's most important to them. How specifically is it helping you get what you want, your highest values? And if you answer that, the more answers you answer that question to, the more you're going to appreciate who they are, what they are, what they stand for and how it's helping you. And when you do, you treat them differently, you respect them. If you then turn around and ask how specifically is what you're dedicated to, helping them fulfill what they're dedicated to, your top three values, helping them in their top three values. Again, you're going to now have new information to be able to articulate and communicate in a way where they're going to listen. Cause now you're seeing how it's helping them.
