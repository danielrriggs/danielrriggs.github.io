 Every individual lives by a set of priorities, set of values. As we go up that list, they become more intrinsic values. As we go down the list, they become more extrinsic values. Intrinsic values are things that you spontaneously do from within, that nobody has to motivate you, incentivize you, or push you to do from the outside. I think of a teenager who loves his video games. Nobody has to remind him to do his video games, but he might have to be reminded to do his homework and his chores and things of this nature. So an intrinsic value is from within. It's inspired from within. It's an inspired, spontaneous. And things from without require motivation.
