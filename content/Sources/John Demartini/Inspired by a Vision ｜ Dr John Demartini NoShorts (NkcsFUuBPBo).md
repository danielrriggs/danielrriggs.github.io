 You know, I was speaking in Dallas, Texas one time, and there was a young boy, 1200 people there. And there was a young boy that came up to me at the end of it. And he was just waiting. He was about 27, eight, nine years old, something like that. And finally comes up to me at the very end, after everybody else leaves. And he says, do you remember me? And I said, I wish I could, but I don't. He said, well, many years ago, I was watching you work and you inspired me. And I decided that I was going to follow in your footsteps and I was going to do something like you're going to do. And I got a tear in me. I couldn't help it. It just teared up because then all of a sudden I snapped and I remembered the little boy. And I remember what it was like to all of a sudden just be me being inspired by what I do and watching what it did to his life. And I know that the real success in your life is not just all the things you attain and all the things you achieve and all the people you make a difference in, but also how many people you pass the torch to.
