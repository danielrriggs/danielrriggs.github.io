 There are seven areas of life that I divide life into. I say that we have a spiritual quest, a quest for being inspired and be an inspired mission in life. A mental quest to develop original ideas and genius ideas that serve people, make a difference and learn. We have love to learn. Then there's the vocational quest to make a difference in business and become achieving and successful, as some people call it. Then we have also the desire for financial quest to have more wealth and have our money work for us instead of us having to work for money. And then there's also a relationship quest, family possibly, but at least partnership and community, communion with a relationship, companionship. And then there's also a social quest to be able to make a difference in the world and be a leader and wake that up in us. And then there's also physical health and wellbeing. We want to feel our best, look our best and feel the vitality and energy throughout the day.
