 Your chemistry is changing based on your ratios of perceptions. If you perceive something supporting it, the chemistry goes in one direction. If you see something challenging, it goes in another direction. And it changes literally faster than you can blink an eye. But what's interesting is this thing is fluctuating based on your ratios throughout the day. As you're having things occur that you're not expecting, that it's not meeting expectation, you get the fight or flight responses in those chemistries. If something exceeds your expectation, you're very joyful about it, it gets another set of chemistries. Every ratio of your perception of what's going on changes your chemistry. If I say something around you that's really supportive and makes you feel proud of yourself, your serotonin is going up. If I say something makes you feel ashamed, your serotonin goes down.
