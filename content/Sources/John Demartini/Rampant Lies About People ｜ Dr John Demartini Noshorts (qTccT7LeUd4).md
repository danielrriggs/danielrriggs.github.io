 When we live by priority and we're more objective and we see both sides simultaneously and we mitigate our risks and we calm down our infatuations and our resentments and have self-governance, we have a higher probability of authenticity, a higher probability of walking a path of truthfulness and a higher probability of self-worth, because our self-worth is a reflection of that. But most of the time we're not doing that. We're living in lower priority things. We're subordinating to outer authorities, trying to live in other people's lives, trying to be second at being ourselves and others instead of being first at being ourselves. And we end up not empowering our life. And then we're sitting there with our opinions and we think those are truths, but they're really just opinions. You see this in politics, you see this in religion, you see this in hypocrisies and bigotries and racial discriminations and biases. These are, these are basically rampant lies about people.
