 If you think for some reason that your value system is right and you projected onto your family, you got a lot of clashes because they're going to perceive that their value system is right and they're going to project back. And so there's lots of clashes and every family, there's a balance of peace and war. I've asked people in Breakthrough Experiences for decades now, how many of you had times of calm and times of turmoil, times of peace and times of war, times of getting together and times, you know, fighting and every hand goes up. So it's unrealistic to expect peace all the time. You don't grow there. If you get nothing but peace and support, you stay juvenile dependent. If you get nothing but the challenge and conflict, you get precociously independent. If you put the two together, which is what happens in the family, you get maximum growth. Maximum growth and development occurs at the border of the pairs of opposites. That's why nature has it.
