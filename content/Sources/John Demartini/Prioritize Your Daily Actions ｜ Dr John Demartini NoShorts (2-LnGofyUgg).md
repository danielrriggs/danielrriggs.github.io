 You have to prioritize your daily actions. If you're not prioritizing what's really, really, really most important and you're minoring in majors and majoring in minors, don't expect to go to the next level. You want to make sure you stick to the highest priority actions. You also want to realize that if you're expecting people that have more wealth, if you're not saving and investing money and having a value on wealth building, you're not likely to get people that are in playing in that field. You have to exemplify it in order to get those types of clients. Anything that you're not willing to empower in your life, other people are going to overpower you. And you're not going to lead that area. You're going to follow.
