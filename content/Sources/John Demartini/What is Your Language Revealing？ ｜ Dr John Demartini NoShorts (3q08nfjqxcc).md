 Anytime we subordinate to outer authority, peer pressure or individual, we'll hear ourselves in our head, I should be doing this, ought to be doing this, I'm supposed to be doing this, I need to be doing this, I got to do this, I have to do this, I must do this. All those are imperative languages. And whenever you have imperative language, you know that that's not you speaking. That's the authority that you've injected into your life speaking. Cause when you're doing something that's really you, it's, I would love to do it. I choose to do it. I desire to do it. I want to do it. They're indicative languages, not imperative languages.
