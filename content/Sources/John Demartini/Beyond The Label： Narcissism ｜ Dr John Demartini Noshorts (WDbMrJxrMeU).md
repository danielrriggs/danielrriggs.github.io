 Anytime you look down on somebody and you're too proud to admit what you see in them is inside you, you tend to put on your narcissistic persona. Anytime you're enamored with them and infatuated with them and too humble to admit what you see in them is inside you, you put on your altruistic persona. So relative to different people, you play out different personas. And I can guarantee I can demonstrate this and show this to people and then show you the same individual playing off the opposite role in front of somebody else. I know an individual who's very quote, narcissistic and a lot of people like to label them them. But the moment they meet somebody that they are subordinating to and looking up to, I watched them go the other side. And I've also seen people that are really altruistic have their values challenged, look down and resent somebody and play out a narcissistic side. So I don't want to label people. I think that's a subjective bias. It's a box. It's not the truth about the whole individual. And so beware.
