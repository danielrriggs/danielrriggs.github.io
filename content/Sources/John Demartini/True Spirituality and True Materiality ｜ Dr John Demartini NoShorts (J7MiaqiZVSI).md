 True spirituality, which is equanimity and the grace state, a gratitude state, and true materiality, money exchange, allows us literally expressing axiology, the study of values to the fullest. What's interesting is when we live by our highest value and live congruently with what's most important to us, we have the most objectivity, the most balanced state. When we live by lower values, we have the highest probability of going into this exaggerated or minimized state. So you might say that nature and in our own economic transactions are helping us become authentic, helping us become inspired.
