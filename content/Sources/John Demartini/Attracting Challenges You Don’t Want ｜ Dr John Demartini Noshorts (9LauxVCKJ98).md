 If you are not living by your highest value and you're not pursuing challenges that are inspiring to you that you want to solve and being creative and solutionary, you're going to be problem oriented. You're going to be basically wanting to avoid the problems and look for easy pathways. And in the process of doing it, you're going to attract the challenges that you're not wanting. And then you're going to have distress, which is illness promoting. So if you're not filling your day with challenges that inspire you, it fills up with challenges that don't. If you're not filling your day with rejections, that means going after and doing something knowing full well you're going to be liked and disliked and embrace that and be willing to embrace the ridicule, the violent opposition until you're self evident pursuing something meaningful, then you're going to be sitting there wallowing in this pity party, trauma drama, ho hum do drum, scars, state of mind, because you're basically sitting there looking for one side of the world and the other side hurts.
