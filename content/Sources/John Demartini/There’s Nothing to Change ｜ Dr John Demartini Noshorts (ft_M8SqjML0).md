 So the moment we actually have a pure reflective awareness and we're authentic and we have an unconditional love for a moment, and we're not trying to change them relative to us from superiority or change us relative to them with inferiority. Anytime you try to get others to live in your values, you end up having futility. Anytime you try to get yourself to live in other people's values, you have futility. But the moment you unconditionally love somebody and have equanimity and pure reflective awareness, there's no desire to change them relative to you or them. You relative to them, there's nothing to change. And now your will, your intentions matching what is, which was called in the ancient theology, divine will, human will, match divine will. And you have grace and you have inspiration and you have revelation and you have awareness and you have the soul, the state of unconditional love.
