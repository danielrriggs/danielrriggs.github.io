 Every time I've had people that have been clinically depressed, I ask them, what are you comparing your life to? And then they come up with something. Well, my mom should have been here. My dad didn't do this. My wife's not doing this. I go, if they did, what would be the drawback? They go, I don't see any drawbacks. I'd be happy if I did. Well, as long as you have a fantasy that's one sided and then your life is not matching that, well, of course you're going to be depressed. And your depression, which is this quote of negative experience, is basically a compensation for your addiction to the other side. The positive experience. If you embrace both sides, you don't have that. And if you expect people to live in their values and you don't have unrealistic expectations, they won't betray you. Betrayal is not what somebody does to you. It's what you do to yourself with an unrealistic expectation.
