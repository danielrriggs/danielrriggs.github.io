 I really believe that many people are going around, when I ask them how many want to be financially independent, everybody puts their hand up and I ask them how many are, a lot of hands go down, 99% of them. And the one percenters are the ones that actually understand that if they want to have financial independence and freedom and financial wealth, they have to value it. That means they'll study it. That means they'll mentor under it. That means they'll take the actions on it. And until you see those actions overriding the other actions, you really don't have a value on financial wealth and you deserve it. Now that doesn't devalue in any of the other forms of wealth. And there's no reason why you can't have all the forms of wealth, but it just means that you're now having money work for you instead of you having to work for money.
