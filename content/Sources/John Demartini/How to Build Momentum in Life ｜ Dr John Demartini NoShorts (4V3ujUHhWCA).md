 And the majority of people are walking around clueless about what they really want and fitting in instead of standing out. They compare themselves to others. They put other people on pedestals. They minimize themselves. They think they've got something they don't. They're too humble to admit what they see in them as inside themselves. They play small and shrink instead of shine, right? And they envy other people, try to imitate other people, and they lose themselves and cloud the clarity of their own calling. And they hold themselves back from something great. And it's not that it's missing, it's not, but dormant. The second they get back and find out what that value is, and the second they get prioritized and learn to delegate lower priority things and get on with the other one and do something that serves people to earn an income, to pay for the delegation, they liberate themselves from the mediocre life and they start building momentum to do something amazing.
