 If you went through life and you never got a criticism, you might be losing customers and never even speak to you. You may never get feedback. You may be living in a fantasy about how great your product is and you may be eroding your business because nobody spoke up to you. Wise person pursues challenges that inspire them and embraces the response from people, ridicule, criticism, whatever, to refine their pathway to make sure they're creating a greater product or service to reach more people. So you want to write down the benefits of criticism until you're actually grateful for it. You want to realize you can't escape it, it's going to be there. And if you don't embrace it, you're going to do it within yourself because you're not going to fulfill what you want because you're not getting the feedback and you're going to play smaller game and that's your own doing because you're not willing to embrace that.
