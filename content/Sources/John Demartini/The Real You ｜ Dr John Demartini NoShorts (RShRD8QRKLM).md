 No matter what you've done or not done, you're worthy of love. And give yourself permission to be you. Because there's never going to be more magnificent you than the real you. And if you give yourself permission to do that, you'll give yourself permission to do something extraordinary on planet Earth. Because the most originality, the most innovative, the most creative you is the real you.
