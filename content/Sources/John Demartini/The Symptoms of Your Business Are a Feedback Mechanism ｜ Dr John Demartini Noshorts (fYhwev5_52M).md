 From a business perspective, if you are puffing yourself up and thinking you're superior to your customer and don't meet their needs, they don't buy, which humbles you. And if you think you're superior to your employees and you don't meet their needs, they'll create a union to counterbalance you, to get things back in balance. The symptoms of business or feedback mechanisms, just like the symptoms of your brain and mind are feedback mechanisms to let you know when you're not authentic and not in sustainable fair exchange.
