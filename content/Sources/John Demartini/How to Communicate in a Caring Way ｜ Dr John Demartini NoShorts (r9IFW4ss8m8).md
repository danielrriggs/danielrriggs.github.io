 If you self-righteously think that your values are more important than somebody else's, you'll talk down to them carelessly. If you minimize yourself and you exaggerate them and think their values are more important than you, you'll basically talk up to them carefully. But if you have equal sets of values and you honor what they value and you honor what you value, you have a communication that's between them caringly.
