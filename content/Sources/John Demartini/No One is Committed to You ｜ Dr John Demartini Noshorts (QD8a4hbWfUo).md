 The person is never committed to anything but whatever is fulfilling their values. So if they perceive that you're helping them fulfill their values, they're going to look like they're committed to you. But the second they see you undermining what's important to them, they're going to start withdrawing from you. So the idea that when you're getting in this committed relationship, he's now committed to me or she's now committed to me, it's really pipe dream.
