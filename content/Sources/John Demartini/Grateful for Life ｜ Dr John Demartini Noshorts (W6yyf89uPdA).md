 When you're doing what you love and loving what you do, pain and pleasure doesn't interfere with purpose. I've said for 35 years, let neither pleasure nor pain interfere with pursuit of purpose. Your highest value, your purpose, you will embrace pain and pleasure equally. You will not see them separable. You'll see them as two sides of a magnet. You'll see them as one. And you'll embrace both in the pursuit of it. And you will tend to see that the challenge or the pain or the difficulties are feedbacks to help you refine and make sure you're on track. You don't see it in the way, you see it on the way. You don't see it as obstructive, you see it as instructive, which helps you become a master of that destiny instead of some victim of history. So when you live congruently, you feel grateful for life because you feel everything's working. The universe is working on your behalf.
