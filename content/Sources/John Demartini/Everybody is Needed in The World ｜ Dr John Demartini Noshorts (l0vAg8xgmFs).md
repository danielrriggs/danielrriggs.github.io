 Well, whatever is highest on your value, your identity, your ontological identity revolves around it. So if somebody says, who am I, if you're a mother with three children and you're dedicated to raising three children, if somebody asks, who are you, you'd probably say a mother. You come to me because I'm dedicated to research and teaching, I'd probably say teacher. But I'm not limited to that. My mortal expression is that. Obviously a more new, a spheric representation of spirituality beyond that. But at the same time, you're talking to that form. So you might as well identify the form through at least something. And it's all honorable. Everybody's needed in the law of heuristic escalation. Whatever goes on in the world, there's somebody with its complementary opposite going on in the world to counterbalance it, to make up that balancing the matrix of love that's there, that's ever present that we can't disturb, even if we try.
