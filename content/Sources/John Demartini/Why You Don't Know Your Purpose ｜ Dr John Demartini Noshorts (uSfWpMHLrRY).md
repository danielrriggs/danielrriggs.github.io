 I have people come in and say, I don't know what my purpose is. And I said, your life demonstrates your purpose every day. The reason why you don't know it is because you inject the values of others that you're subordinating to and comparing yourself to. And when you filter, you inject all those values, you cloud the clarity of your own mission, which is your highest value that's trying to express itself. So the real truth is your life is demonstrating it, but you're expecting it to be something it's not and thinking somehow you're, you're not clear. And then you don't want to admit what's true because you think it should be this. So when you hear imperative language like shoulds and ought tos and supposed tos and got tos and have tos and musts, that's a sign you've injected values of other people because you never should yourself from your own values. You just say, this is what I would love to do and pursue it.
