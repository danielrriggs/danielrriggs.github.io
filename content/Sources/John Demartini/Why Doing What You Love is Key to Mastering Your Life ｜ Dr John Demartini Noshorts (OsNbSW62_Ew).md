 If you do the highest grade things, I teach research, write and travel. That's pretty well in. Everything else, I found people who are experts in those areas and they love doing those things that I'm not so great at, that's not my core competence. And that allows me to be inspired and to be grateful and to be able to love, to do what I'm doing on a daily basis. If I had to do all the things that need to be done in my business, I'd probably weigh down. I'd lose my magnetism. I wouldn't be as charismatic because I'd be grouchy and I'd be frustrated. I'd be having to do stuff I don't want to do. So if you're trapped in those things, temporarily ask, how is doing this temporarily helping me move one step closer towards what it is that I really want to do. And then see things on the way, not in the way, temporarily until you can delegate it. And then free it up and get on with the things that are most meaningful to you. The higher you go into delegations, the more magnetic and charismatic you become. The more you do that with other people's lives, the more magnetic and charismatic you become.
