 the things that build you and the things that try to destroy you are necessary to transform your lives and help you evolve. So you want to ask this question, how specifically is whatever's happening in this rejection, how's it, how's it helping me? How's it on the way, not in the way? How's it strengthening me? And if they were to do the opposite and support me, what would be the drawbacks? We're assuming that when somebody supports us, that's got a benefit without a drawback, but it's got drawbacks too. Sometimes people support you and they make you disabled and make you dependent and make you less resourceful, less creative, and end up people that are overprotected and supported most of their life, they end up working for other people, people that are challenged and rejected, may times become entrepreneurs and stand on their own two feet and figured out themselves and make decisions and command the world. So I think that you need a little bit of both.
