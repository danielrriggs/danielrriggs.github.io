 Every human being lives by a set of priorities, a set of values. Whenever they're living in alignment congruently with their highest value, the energy level goes up. And whenever they're doing things that are low on their values, the energy level goes down. That's every human being that does that. So you can see in your life when you're doing certain things, even if you're tired, you can wake right up and you go again. And other things, even if you're not tired, you can get tired even thinking about them. So the hierarchy of your values dictate your energy level. And if you're setting priorities and doing the highest priority things on a daily basis, you'll have more energy.
