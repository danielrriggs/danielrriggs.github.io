 The hierarchy of your values dictates what you see in the world, what you act upon the world, and where you make decisions and intentions. If you feel you're not manifesting in the area that you want, it's because you have something higher on your values than you realize what you want. So take what you say you want and stack it up higher and higher and higher and higher in the values until your life demonstrates it's manifesting. If you are taking action step consistently on a daily basis towards what you say you want, that's a sign that what you say you want is high on your values. But if you procrastinate and hesitate on the things you say you want, that means there's things higher on your values and you will only frustrate yourself unless you either change your goals to match your true values or change your values to match your goals.
