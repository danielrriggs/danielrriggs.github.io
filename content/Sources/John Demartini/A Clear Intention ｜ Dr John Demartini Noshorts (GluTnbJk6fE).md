 are thinking that somehow when they're going after an intention, that if it's easy, then it's meant to be, and if it's difficult, it's not. And if they're supported, well, okay. If it's challenging, well, then it's not meant to be. And then they stop and they give up on their intention instead of holding their intention so clearly and embracing both support and challenge, both the kind and the cruel, and both opposites along the journey. So I always like to think of you must have such a clear vision like a sword, a two-edged sword, and you're focusing on it like a knight, and you focus on the vision so clearly. And whatever comes along the way, you part, and you see as part of the manifestation. And sometimes the very thing you think is supportive also is actually slowing down the process. And the very thing you think is challenging is actually catapulting the process. So you don't want to let either of those illusions interfere with the message and the vision of what the intention is.
