 The universe rewards equity and equanimity. Equanimity within yourself where you're not exaggerating or minimizing yourself, you're being yourself, which is when you live by your highest value, increases that probability. And equity between you and others where you're not puffing yourself up or meeting yourself up, you're actually being with people, present with people, finding out what their needs are, caring about them, and finding a way of delivering those needs. If you do and you're inspired to do that, then you're an entrepreneur in the making.
