 When you're infatuated with somebody, you're blind to the downsides. When you're resentful, you're blind to the upsides. So when you're infatuated and making love, the parts that you're blind to are epigenetically coded into the equation to make sure that they surface to teach you how to love those parts of the individual you love, both sides, and the children. And that's why the parts that you're infatuated with, they come with the parts you resent. And then when they surface, you say, well, you're just like your mom. You're just like the parts I don't like about your mom, or you're just like the parts I don't like about your dad. So you will automatically breed epigenetically the coded components that you're trying to avoid in a relationship to teach you that you can't avoid. You can only embrace the two sides of life.
