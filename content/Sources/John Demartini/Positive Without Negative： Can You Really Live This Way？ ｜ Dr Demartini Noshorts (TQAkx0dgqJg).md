 Many times we've been hoodwinkled into thinking we're supposed to get positive without negative, nice without me, kind without cruel. But can you really live that way? If I was to go up to you and start a relationship with you and I said, okay, my expectations, you'd always be positive, never negative, always kind, never cruel, always giving, never taking, always generous, never stingy, peaceful, never raffle. You would go, uh, don't can't guarantee I could do that because your intuition would know that that's not obtainable. But yet we do it. We're searching for that which is unobtainable and trying to avoid that which is unvoidable throughout our lives, primarily because we've been told, you know, be nice, don't be mean, be kind, don't be cruel, be positive, don't be negative. We're, we're told this moral hypocrisy about how we're supposed to be. And you're trying to get rid of half of your life and trying to get rid of half of life in the pursuit of it, instead of embracing it. So the more we strive for one side, the more the other side smacks us. And we keep repeating our cycles.
