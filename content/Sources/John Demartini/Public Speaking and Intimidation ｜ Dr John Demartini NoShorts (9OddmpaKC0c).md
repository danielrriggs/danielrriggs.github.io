 The second you see somebody that you think has more knowledge or more experience or more success in those areas, again, they're more spiritually aware, they're more intelligent, they're more successful in business, they're more successful financially or in relationship or social influence, possibly health and fitness. The second you think you're the underdog and they're the overdog, boom, you're going to have the fear of speaking. Because it's a natural tendency to want to listen to people you think that have more than you and to speak to people you think you can share with, they can help. So you want to make sure in order to overcome those fears is by stopping and looking in your audience and looking who in the audience it is that you're intimidated by. It's not all of them. It's just a handful of people, probably.
