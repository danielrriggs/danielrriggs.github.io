 I define a universal law as a law that applies in the infinite micro and the infinite macro domains of existence. And those in the subatomic worlds, if we go exploring with the microscope and electron microscope and go into the subtle world, we find there's certain laws and principles that apply on a very subtle level that's even beyond the scene. And if we go into the astronomical domains and go to the greatest telescopes, we find certain laws apply even on those levels. And somewhere in between, the human physics and metaphysics of man, mankind or humankind, is actually following the same laws. So a universal law is something that applies in the micro and the macro as above and below, you might say, in life. And one of the great universal laws that have been found throughout the ages and almost every great philosopher has come upon is called the law of the one in the many. And the law of the one in the many can be said in hundreds of different ways and almost every field has expression of it.
