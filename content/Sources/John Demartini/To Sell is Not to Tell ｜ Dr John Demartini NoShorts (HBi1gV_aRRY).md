 To sell is not to tell, it's to ask questions, to establish the needs of people and to find out what is valuable to them and to communicate in those values. So if you get criticism in a sales process, they're letting you know that you're not meeting your needs and you're projecting assumptions onto them instead of asking and finding and discovering and determining and qualifying and actually confirming needs.
