 For everything, there's its opposite. And when the human mind sees one side without its opposite, it becomes poised, imbalanced and poisoned instead of poised. And when it does, it gets caught in its emotional, irrational, fractionated perspective, which then leaves your intuition trying to hone you in to see the other side. And wisdom occurs when you see both sides at the same moment. And so the quality of your life is based on the quality of the questions you ask. If you ask wise questions that reveal the side that you're not seeing and balance them, out comes gratitude and love and certainty because you now know that that's the truth. And that's what the hidden order is, that there's a complementation of opposites. And when you see them fully at the same moment, you're graced by the presence of the order.
