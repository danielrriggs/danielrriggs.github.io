 Imagine you got a positive pole of the magnet and a negative pole of the magnet. And imagine the positive pole being a philia, an attraction, and the negative pole being a phobia, a repulsion. Now if you try to get a philia without a phobia or an attraction without a repulsion, you're probably going to have some snacks. In society, there's a spectrum of people with different value systems and they're complete opposites. You have pro-life, pro-abortion, pro-democratic, anti-democratic, pro-capitalism, anti-capitalism, pro-guns, anti-guns. And so as you go through life, you're going to have somebody like what you're up to and dislike it, accept and reject, like and dislike, support and challenge, praise and reprimand.
