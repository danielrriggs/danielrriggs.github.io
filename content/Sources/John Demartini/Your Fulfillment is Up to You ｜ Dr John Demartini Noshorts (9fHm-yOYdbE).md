 If you're not filling your day with high priority things, it's automatically decaying and ending up with entropy and low priority things. The basic law of nature. If you don't use it, you lose it. So our job is to constantly be on the alertness for what's truly meaningful to us and to fill our day to do it. Because nobody is dedicated to getting up in the morning and dedicating our life to our fulfillment. And maybe you found that out in your life. Nobody's getting up and saying, I want to make sure that you're fulfilled today. Wouldn't that be interesting? If a hundred people came to you every morning, what can we do for you to fulfill your life? Of course, if they did, there'd be a drawback. You would lose all your faculties to getting things done and become incompetent. You'd be too supported and become jubilantly dependent on them and it wouldn't work. You do not want to delegate and become dependent on others at the expense of doing what's highest on your values and empowering yourself.
