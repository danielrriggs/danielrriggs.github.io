 Let's say that you're very, very intelligent. You've got a lot of knowledge and you've stored it, but you've never converted it and packaged it into some form of financial wealth. But you have intellectual property that just hasn't been converted, but it's a form of wealth. It's potential wealth, not actual financial wealth. In fact, all forms of wealth can be converted into financial wealth, but there's also social influence. You may have a massive network of people in your life, but you've never converted that into financial wealth by leveraging and sense and doing deals with people, et cetera. So you could have intellectual wealth, social wealth. You could also be very beautiful, very attractive, very handsome. And there are various women out there. I think there's been some supermodels out there that were very wealthy individuals financially because of their beauty. And that's a form of wealth.
