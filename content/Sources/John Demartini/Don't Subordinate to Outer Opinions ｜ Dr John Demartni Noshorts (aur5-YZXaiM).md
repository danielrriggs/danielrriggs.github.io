 The night I met Paul Bragg, I woke up a value inside me that I didn't even know I had, and that is how much I wanted to learn. I never believed I could. I subordinated to the world on the outside who believed that I wasn't going to be able to, and I let their opinions of me override my calling. We're not here to live in the shadows of anyone. We're here to stand on the shoulders of giants. But I had subordinated to other people's opinions of me and labels until the night I met Paul Bragg. And when he spoke, he initiated a yearning inside to access what I valued most.
