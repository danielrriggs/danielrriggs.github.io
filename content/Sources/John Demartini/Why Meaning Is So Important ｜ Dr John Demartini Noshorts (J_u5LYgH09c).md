 If you do work that makes money, that fills everybody's needs but has no meaning, you'll end up taking your money and go do addictive behaviors. Meaning is more important than people realize. Nobody goes to work for the sake of a company. They go to work to fulfill their highest values and meaning. If they don't feel they have meaning, they go into the amygdala part of the brain and they look for immediate gratification to compensate for an unfulfilled life. So it's important to meet needs that also fulfill yours. Having that win-win is your vocation and vacation become the same.
