 When you're living according to your own values, you can easily see where you're disciplined. If you're attempting to live by somebody else's values, you will label yourself not disciplined. Raise your hand if you can see that. So it's wise to know what your values are. It's wise to not expect yourself to do anything but live them. Anytime you expect yourself to live outside your highest values, you're going to automatically beat yourself up. You're going to have what I've called the ABCDs of negativity, which is internal anger and aggression, internal blame and feelings of betrayal, internal criticism and internal challenge, internal despair and depression, because you're expecting yourself to be somebody you're not. And these ABCDs of negativity that you're experiencing are absolute necessary feedback mechanisms inside your psyche to give you feedback to let you know that you're expecting to live outside your values and you're not being authentic.
