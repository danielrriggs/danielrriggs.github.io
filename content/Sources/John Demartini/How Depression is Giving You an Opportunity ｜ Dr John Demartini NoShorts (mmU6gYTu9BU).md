 The real life is what it is, not the fantasy you're expecting it to be. So when you do, you'll realize that your depression is letting you know where your delusion is, your unrealistic expectation is, and giving you an opportunity to go back and put your expectations and ground them and get real about them. People that get grounded and put real expectations on people don't have the depression.
