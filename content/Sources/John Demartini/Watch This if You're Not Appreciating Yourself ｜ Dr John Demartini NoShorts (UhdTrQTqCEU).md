 Look in the mirror and say, no matter what you've done or not done, you're worthy of love because the truth is you are. And the only reason you're not appreciating yourself is you're somehow not honoring your own values. You're trying to live by somebody else's and you're judging yourself according to it. And the other one is I'd say give yourself permission to do something extraordinary on planet Earth because the real you, the magnificence of you really are is far greater than any fantasies you'll ever inject into yourself. Give yourself permission to do something amazing. The real true you is amazing.
