 When somebody works in a company and somebody delegates things to them, if they delegate things that align with their highest value, they will automatically be engaged and inspired to do it. And you can rely on them and they'll be, you don't have to micromanage them. But if you delegate something to somebody that's low on their values, you'll probably have to micromanage them, incentivize them, remind them, and everything else, because it's not important to them. So don't expect people to do things that aren't really important to you. They're never loyal to you. They never betray you. You do by your unrealistic expectations to have them do something that's low on their values or your realistic expectations. If you have them do something that is aligned with their highest values.
