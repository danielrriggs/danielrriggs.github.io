 The divine perfection is the synthesis and synchronicity of opposite, which is what true love is about and is what's true fulfillment. Half fulfillment is seeking one side. The other half fulfillment that you deny keeps you from having true fulfillment. When you embrace the pains and pleasures, when you embrace the nice and the means, the kinds of cruels, the supportive and challenging, all the polarities at the same moment, you awaken yourself to the true order and you don't become in a sense addicted to a fantasy in the afterlife that's going to rescue you from the truth that what makes you grow in this life. So I say that it's wisdom to embrace this now and see the divine perfection now and embrace the heaven and hell that we create in our own mind by desiring and separating the inseparables. By doing that, we embrace what's truly here and there really is a magnificent order here. I don't look for the afterlife to bring me fulfillment because every single day I have something to be grateful for and I can stop and see the pairs of opposites now and realize that I've been loved because love is always a balance of support and challenge.
