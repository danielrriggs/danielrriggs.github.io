 If you don't fill your day with high priority things that inspire you, it's going to keep filling up with low priority distractions that don't. One is builds momentum and to make a great achievement. And the other one makes you have resistance and procrastination, hesitation, frustration. And anytime you're not fulfilling your highest value, you'll automatically, because of the unfulfillment, be looking for consumerism, addictive behaviors, compulsive behaviors, immediate gratification behaviors, to compensate for the unfulfillment. And this is why we overeat. This is why we do consumption of sugars and stimulants because we're not fulfilled. Because when we're really fulfilled, we don't have time for that. We're really doing what we love doing every day.
