 The second we have equity between ourselves and others, we care about what they value as much as we care about what we value. And we make sure we care enough to communicate what we have as an offering, a product, service or idea in terms of their values. In the process of doing that, they're more likely to receive and buy, and we're more likely to receive the rewards from that. As we provide a service or product, we receive a reward. We have a transaction. If we have equity and equanimity, we have the highest probability of sustainable transaction.
