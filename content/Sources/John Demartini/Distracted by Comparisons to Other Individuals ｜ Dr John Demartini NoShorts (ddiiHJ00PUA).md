 The majority of people subordinate to other people and compare themselves to other people. They meet people, they think, oh that person is more intelligent than me, that person is more successful, that person is wealthier, that person has a more stable relationship, that person is more of a leader, more influential, that person is better looking or healthier, that person is more inspired. As long as they compare themselves to other people, instead of comparing their daily actions to their own dreams, they are going to minimize themselves, inject the values of others into their lives and attempt to live by other people's values which is self-defeating. And this is what erodes the possibility of them waking up their genius. We need to not stand in the shoulders or in the shadows of people, we need to stand on their shoulders by realizing what we see in others we have inside naturally. And we're not missing it, nothing's missing in us. We have the capacity to do extraordinary things if we allow the people that inspire us to wake up that part of us that's inspired.
