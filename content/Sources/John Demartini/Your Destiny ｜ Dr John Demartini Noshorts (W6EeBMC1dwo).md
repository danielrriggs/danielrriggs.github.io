 Your destiny is a destination based on your space, that's your GPS inside your mind, and time horizons and your intention, the direction. Your intention is the direction, your space and time horizons are the space and time coordinates of your destiny. Your destinies are changing as your values evolve and as you fulfill your voids. Your life's journey is a summation of those destinies.
