 When we infatuate with somebody else and admire somebody else, put them on the pedestal, see more advantage and disadvantage to them, we give them credit. And when we go into pride, we give ourselves credit, because we're assuming that we cause more advantage and disadvantage to someone. So pride is an assumption that you with your motor actions have advanced or given advantage over disadvantage or benefits over drawbacks to someone. Infatuation with somebody is an assumption they're giving you more advantage than disadvantage, more pleasures than pains from somebody. Blame or shame is when you feel like you've caused more disadvantage than advantage or negatives to somebody than positives. And when you resent somebody, you're blaming them for having more negatives than positives and you're going to avoid them. So it's the ratios of perceptions that give rise to the idea of credit and blame, the ratios of perceptions that we perceive.
