 If you require motivation to do what you say is important to you, what you say is important to you isn't. We excel in the area of our highest value. We tend to flounder in the area of our lower values. But because everybody around us have a different set of values, if we don't fill our day with high priority actions, other people will impose and project their values onto us and fill our day with entropic behavior, they'll undermine our potential. So we have to be able to say no to people on the outside and say yes to what's truly important and then make sure that that which is important is serving those people on the outside, not necessarily in being imposed from the outside, but serving those people on the outside.
