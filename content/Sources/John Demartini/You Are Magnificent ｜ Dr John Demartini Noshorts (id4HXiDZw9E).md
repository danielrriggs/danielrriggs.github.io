 I have no interest in being any human being on the planet except Dr. Demartini. And I would want you to look in the mirror and be able to say the same thing about your own life, because the magnificence of who you truly are is far greater than any fantasies you'll ever impose on yourself by the comparison of other people and the injection of other people. That doesn't mean we don't want to learn from mentors. That doesn't mean you want to learn from people that have done great things. It's just that we're not here to be them. We're here to be us. We learn to stand on their shoulders and incorporate and then go and transcend beyond. And there's no reason we can't do that except the judgments that we believe come from others.
