 So if you're doing something that you're not inspired to do, you're going to feel disengaged. But it's not because of the action, it's because of the perception of the action. That particular action that's being requested of you could be perceived in such a way that it could fully engage you. You could ask how specifically is doing this particular responsibility or duty? How specifically is it going to help me fulfill what's most meaningful to me? How's it going to help me fulfill what my dream is, my goal, my objectives? If you answer that question, the more you answer the question, the more you will feel that you're not doing it out of duty or out of obligation. You're doing it because you would love to do it because it's helping you get what you want.
