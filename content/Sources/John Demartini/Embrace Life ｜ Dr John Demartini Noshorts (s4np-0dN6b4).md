 People bang their head against the wall, keep repeating history in their life, just like societies and cultures do, because they keep striving for a one-sided world. There's many delusions that people have and seeking for one-sided experiences is futile. You're trying to get a relationship with one side, trying to get a goal with one side, trying to get anything with one side is fantasy and it's futile. That's why nature brings the other side, because we maximally grow at the border of support and challenge. We maximally grow at the border of all pairs of opposites. And this is not new. This is again, thousands of years old. We know this, but we tend to forget it. We need to be reminded of it. Embrace both sides. If you want to love somebody, you got to embrace both sides. The longer you're with somebody, you know you're going to have both sides, things you like and dislike about them, the things that little picadillas that you don't like and the things you admire. Both are necessary for you to grow. Maximum growth and development occurs at the border of pairs of opposites. That's what love is.
