 There's a hidden order in our existence and when we actually see things in a perfect balance, we access the hidden order in our parent chaos. And whoever has the most order is the one that gives the orders. They're the leaders. They're the ones that have the most certainty. But the second we have the subjective bias distorting our reality, we're caught automatically being run from extrinsic sources, exogenously, instead of actually being intrinsically called towards a purpose in life. And that's why purpose, telos, the calling, the metier, the primary objective, the mission in life, which takes us into our executive center, gives us the mastery of our future instead of being a victim of history, we become a master of destiny.
