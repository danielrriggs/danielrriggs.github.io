 If you also expect yourself to live in somebody else's values, let's say you infatuate with somebody and put them on a pedestal and inject some of their values into your life. And you're too humble to admit what you see in them is inside you and you playing small to them and inject their values. And you try to live in their values, you'll think, what am I doing wrong? I keep sabotaging, I keep having limited beliefs. I keep not being disciplined. I'm not focused. I keep making mistakes because you're trying to live in somebody else's value. When in fact, you're here to design to live in your own.
