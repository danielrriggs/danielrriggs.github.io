 Each of us have a unique set of values and priorities in life. Some people are dedicated to intellectual pursuits and solving problems. Others dedicated to building a business. Others, finances. They want to build financial wealth. Others, having a beautiful family. And by the way, if you took that person that had a desire for a beautiful family and you say, I'll give you a million dollars for your children, unless they were teenagers, you probably wouldn't give them up. You know, teenagers, you might give them away for less, I'm joking. But in the reality is that that's a form of wealth, because you call your children priceless.
