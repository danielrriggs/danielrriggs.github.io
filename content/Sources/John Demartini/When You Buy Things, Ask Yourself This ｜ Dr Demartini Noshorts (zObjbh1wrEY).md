 You want to ask yourself, when I'm buying something, before you impulsively buy and just immediately gratify yourself, take the cost of what you're about to buy and stop and reflect on what would be, if I was to invest that difference and allow that to go forward in time, is this product worth the cost of all the money it could be generating? Not just the money you're doing now. And then factor in how many hours you have to put into work in order to save a portion to be able to buy the things you want. Make sure you look at what the real cost of buying something is to make an informed decision instead of just impulsively buying. Because you go to a mall, there's people with salespeople trying everything gimmick they can to get a hold of it. And that may not be something you're really wanting, you're just impulsively buying. If you do, you're going to get into unnecessary debt. And if you do it on credit cards, which is probably the most foolish thing you're going to do, unless you pay that credit card every single month on time, you're paying ridiculous amounts of money and interest rates.
