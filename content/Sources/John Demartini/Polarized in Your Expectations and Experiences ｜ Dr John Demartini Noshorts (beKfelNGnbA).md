 When you are not living in accordance with what you value most and not really filling your day with the highest priority actions, and you feel that you've been bombarded by unexpecteds, and you are down in your amygdala reacting and surviving, you tend to be more polarized in your expectations and experiences. Now what does that mean? That means the amygdala, which is a subcortical area of the brain, tends to want to seek prey and avoid predators, seek pleasure, avoid pain, seek ease, avoid difficulty, seek support, avoid challenge. It tends to divide a magnet into half and try to get one-sided magnets. But in reality, life has both sides.
