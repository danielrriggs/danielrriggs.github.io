 In all my studies of physiology, every sign and symptom that is autonomically generated through cell and epigenetics is a feedback mechanism to try to make sure that we're living authentically, integrally, according to our highest value. So our symptoms are not diseases, our symptoms are guides, if interpreted properly from a light of being on the way, not in the way, and they're helping us live in a way where we're prospering. So our health is actually trying to guide us back to a prosperous life.
