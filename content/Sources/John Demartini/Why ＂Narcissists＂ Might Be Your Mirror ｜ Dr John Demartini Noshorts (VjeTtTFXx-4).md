 Don't be fooled by facades and labels. Look for both sides and you will find out that the labels and diagnostic labels that people put are usually signs of subjective bias and ignorance on the people's parts who are diagnosing them. They're choosing and selecting only part of the equation. And so I find out when you treat people that way, you get that outcome when you actually, and now by the way, if you try to run away from those people, you run into those same people again, because it's your button that you're dealing with, your own subjective bias and you keep running into those people. That's why you see people keep attracting these narcissists as they label them because they're not owning where it is. If you take the time to go in there and look at where you're pointing a finger at them and where you're doing the same thing inside your life, that's what's usually going on. When two people are in a battle in the divorce process, this person over here is labeling that person a narcissist, this person there is labeling that person a narcissistic. They're both trying to get what they want and both thinking about themselves. Instead of going for a sustainable fair exchange.
