 Well, if a person does not organize a way to produce equal or more income, doing something they really love to do, then they're going to end up having a Monday morning blues, Wednesday hump days, thank God it's Fridays and week friggin ends. Because they're going to do something that they have to do and got to do until they should do at a duty, instead of actually something they were looking for and tap dance to work and can't wait to do.
