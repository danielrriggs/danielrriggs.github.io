 When somebody is doing a job that they say, it's not, I hate doing it. I really want to be doing something else. They have this fantasy about doing this other thing, but they're not taking action on it and they're not actually making it happen, which a lot of people, it's because they're not realizing that that job that they have right now is somehow fulfilling what they are valuing. They don't know what that value is. They keep comparing it to other people and it may not be the job. It may be that it's bringing financial security. It's may being a stepping stone in their mind on where they want to go. But until they perceive more advantage and disadvantage going after what they say is important, they won't, because they'll make decisions according to what they think is still going to get more advantage.
