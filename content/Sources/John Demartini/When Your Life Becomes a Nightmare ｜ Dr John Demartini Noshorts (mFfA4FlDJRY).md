 Most people live with fantasies about how they want their life and life becomes a nightmare because it's not matching their fantasy. They have unrealistic expectations and delusions about how life's supposed to be. And then when it doesn't match that they're angry and they self-depreciate. And then they want to blame. But when you automatically go in there and have a realistic expectation that life's going to have both sides and you see both sides and you know that both are necessary. Again, if somebody supports you, you become juvenile dependent on them. So many challenges, you become precocious independent. When you get both of them, you get maximum growth and development. When you finally realize that both of those are necessary in your life and you realize that when you had an overprotective mom, you might have an aggressive father, the pair of opposites, what was love, not the idea that one liked me and one didn't like me. They're both necessary. When you realize that and you have the appreciation for both of those at the same time, then really nothing can throw you off because that's what life offers you, a pair of opposites.
