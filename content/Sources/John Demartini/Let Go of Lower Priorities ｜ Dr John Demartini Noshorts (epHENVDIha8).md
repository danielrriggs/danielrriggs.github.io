 But to the degree that you let go of lower priority things and surround yourself with people that are dedicated as a higher priority to do those things and are masters at it, is the day you get to master what your highest priority is. It took me three years after really clarifying what's the four highest priorities for me, research, write, travel, teach, to be able to let go and delegate to lower priority things to get on with my life. So this is essential if you want to master your life. You have to master the art of trusting people in their own values and relinquishing lower values so a tree can grow to the sun and let go of old branches. There's no way out of it. So the mastery of delegation is essential for self-mastery.
