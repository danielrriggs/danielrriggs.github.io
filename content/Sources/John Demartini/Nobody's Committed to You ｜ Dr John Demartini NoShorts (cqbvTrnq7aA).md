 Nobody's committed to you. The delusion people have is, Oh, I got my ring now and now you're committed to me. No, the ring doesn't mean that. What it means is that you now have the beginning, you're just now beginning after you get the marriage, now to learn how to consistently keep current with their values and learn how to provide in their values more effectively than any competition. If somebody is leaving you in a marriage, your heart must have not been with them because if it was, you would care enough about them to make sure you're communicating what you value in terms of what they value. So if they're leaving, that means that their values aren't being met.
