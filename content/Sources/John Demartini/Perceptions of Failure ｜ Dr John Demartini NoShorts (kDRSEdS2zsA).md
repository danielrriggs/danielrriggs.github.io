 The label of failure is a feedback mechanism, a self depreciating feedback mechanism to try to get you back onto what's truly most important in your life. That's why if you fill your day with high priority actions that inspire you, your day won't fill up with low priority distractions that don't. And anytime you're doing things high in your value, your self worth goes up, your confidence goes up, your achievements go up. And anytime you're doing something low in your values, they go down. And so the perceptions of failure are really a feedback to let you know you're trying to do things that aren't really important in your life.
