 The moment we compare ourselves to others and subordinate to them, in a sense, putting them upon a pedestal, and we're too humble to admit what we see in them inside ourselves, we diminish ourselves and then inject some of their values into our life. When we do, we end up thinking, I ought to be doing this. I should be doing this. I got to, have to, must, supposed to, need to do that. Anytime you hear yourself using imperative language, got to, have to, must, should, ought to, supposed to, need to, you can pretty well bet that that's an injected value by some outer authority you compared yourself to. The moment you compare yourself to somebody that you think is above you, you'll minimize yourself. You'll second guess yourself. You'll have great ideas, but you won't act on them because, well, somebody else has probably thought of that. And some people call that limiting belief. Some people call that sabotage. I think it's just a feedback to let you know that you're not being authentic.
