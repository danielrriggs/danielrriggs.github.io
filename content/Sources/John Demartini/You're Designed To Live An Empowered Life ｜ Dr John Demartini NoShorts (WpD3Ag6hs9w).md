 Any area of your life that you do not have empowered, you're vulnerable for somebody else to overpower. We are designed to live an empowered life, an inspired life. As Nietzsche described, we have a will to empowerment. Now don't confuse that with tyrancy or dictatorship. Empowered means that you have the power to live an inspired life, a power to live the way you truly dream and the way you would love it to be.
