 you're going to go through life and you're going to get rejected. There is an inevitability of rejection because there's complementary opposite value systems throughout society. No matter what you do, some people are going to like it, some people are not. No matter what you do, you're going to get supported and challenged. You're going to have cooperation, competition, agreements and disagreements. That's part of the evolutionary path in business or otherwise. So wisdom is knowing that it's impossible to go through life without it. So you want to ask yourself how specifically is it serving me? It's the criticisms that make you go back and self-reflect and make sure you're really clear on priorities. It's the criticism that make you go and innovate and come up with creative answers. It's customer criticism that you end up making a better quality product or service. Once you see the benefits of criticism equaling to the drawbacks of praise and a level of playing field where neither praise nor reprimand impacts you, you're not sidetracked by it. You use them wisely.
