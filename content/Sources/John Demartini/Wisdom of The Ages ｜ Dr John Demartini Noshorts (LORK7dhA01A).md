 There's the wisdom of the ages with the aging process by having a period of time between the two poles of a perception, or there's the wisdom of the ages without the aging process by seeing it now, seeing both sides now. That's wisdom. Wisdom is the instantaneous recognition that crisis has blessing and the two sides are always present because they're entangled. Just like in quantum entanglement, particle and nanoparticle are inseparable, even though they could be thousands of miles away, they're still inseparable, and they function as a unit. Every event, even though it seems to be one-sided, it always has its opposite pole to balance it.
