 You're going to have to be able to say no sooner or later. If you can't say no to other people, you can't say yes to things that are dreaming you want to dream about. Now it doesn't mean there aren't going to be times when they're going to ask you to do something and you're going to sit there and go, wow, the advantages of doing that are great. And you say yes to it. But there's going to be times when you feel obligated and trapped and feel guilty saying no. And that's the moment I'm talking about. How does it benefit them by saying no? How does it draw back to them by saying yes? And answer that as many times it takes until it's level and there's no guilt associated, you're just telling them the truth and you're back in integrity. They will respect you. They'll value your time more. They'll consider asking in a different, more polite way, more fulfilling way, and you'll end up having more freedom to be able to be truthful to yourself. And then when you really do want to do something, you'll do it because you want to, not because you feel obligated or guilt oriented.
