 Everybody has a hierarchy of values. If you have a person that has a high value on success and wealth, and you have a person that has success and wealth in the center, and you have another person that has wealth at the bottom, if you associate with this person, they will call you greedy. They will call you expensive. If you associate with this person, they will call you cheap, and think you're too generous. If this person hangs out with this person, this person will think that they're very greedy. This person will think they're very cheap and generous. It's all based on values.
