 I really believe that we have a hidden master inside. It's available at all times when we start to prioritize our life, live according to our values, not subordinate to outer authorities, and stand on their shoulders and use them as reflections to awaken inside us what we haven't been able to acknowledge. The moment we acknowledge it and stand on their shoulders, out comes our mastery.
