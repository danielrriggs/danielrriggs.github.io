 You'll always be supported and challenged. Whenever you are challenged, always look for who's supporting you. They'll always be there. You'll never get a crisis without a blessing. You'll never get a challenge without a support. You'll never get a criticism without a praise. The Master sees the pair of opposites at the same moment and dances with thankfulness because the pair of opposites always make love.
