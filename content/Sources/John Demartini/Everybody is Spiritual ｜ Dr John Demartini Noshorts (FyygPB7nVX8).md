 I think that everybody in this room is spiritual. I believe that everybody here, when they live congruently according to their highest values and they're grateful for their life and they see things on the way, not in the way, and they're inspired by some great contribution, that spirituality. So I don't, if I ever put a limit and say that's not spiritual, I usually find it's my illusion.
