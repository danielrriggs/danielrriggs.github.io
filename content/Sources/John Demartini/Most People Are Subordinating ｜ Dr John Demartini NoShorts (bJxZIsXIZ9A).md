 Well, many people are subordinating to the influence of other people. Kohlberg said that most people are trying to avoid pain and seek pleasure. Then other people on top of that are trying to subordinate to mothers, fathers and preachers and teachers. And other people on top of that are subordinating to local communities, cities, states, nation, worlds, views. And very few people stand transcendent to all that and are unborrowed visionaries and go after what they really dream. Those are the people that let the voice and the vision on the inside be louder than all opinions on the outside. Those are the people that make the change in the world. They're the one percenters. We all have that inside us, but it's buried and covered up by all the subordinations and all the comparisons we make to other people instead of comparing our daily actions to our own dreams.
