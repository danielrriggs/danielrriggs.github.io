 If you can't communicate in the way where they're seeing that they're going to get their highest values met, they're not likely to take on the accountability of what you want them to do. And they're going to be less confident in doing it. If the set, the set, see, we learn and gain confidence in whatever we think is going to help us fulfill what's most meaningful to us, most important to us, the highest value. So if we can articulate what we want them to do, the classes, the chores, or whatever it is, or the experiences that we want them to have in terms of their values. Now, how do we do that? We take whatever their values are, their highest values, particularly the top three maybe, and you ask how specifically is doing this chore going to help them fulfill that? If you can't see how it's going to help them fulfill it, you won't be able to articulate it in a way where they'll get it.
