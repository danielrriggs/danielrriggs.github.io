 And if you study philosophy, there's a thing called the dialectic. The dialectic was I have a proposition, then somebody comes with an opposite proposition and the purpose is not a debate to make you right, that's foolishness. But the benefit is that you learn a little bit from what they have to say and maybe change your view. They learn from what you have to say and change your view and eventually come to a synthesis of the two. Well, the law of risk escalation is basically when somebody throws something out there and somebody debates and fights it back and both want to be right and it escalates into something that's just a conflict and neither one of them grow from it. But if they go in there with a dialectic, not the debate, but a dialectic and they go in there with the objective of finding the truth between the two, because both sides have a bit of the truth. If all of a sudden we come from the executive function, we're more likely to be dialectic oriented more than being right and debate oriented, we're more likely to find out and grow from each other and listen.
