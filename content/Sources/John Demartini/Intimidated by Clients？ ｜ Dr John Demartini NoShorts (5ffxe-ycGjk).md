 You also realize that when you're dealing with clients, you're not likely to get clients way beyond your capacity. And if you are sitting in any way intimidated by a client, looking up to them, then you're probably not prepared for them. And there's an exercise I teach in the Breakthrough Experience that is very powerful, it helps people go to new levels every time. And that is to own the traits of the greats. So if you take somebody, let's say you'd like to have clients that are celebrities, or you'd like to have clients that are more wealthy, you'd like to have clients that are influential in their field, or maybe have a big social network. Just know that whatever you see in them, if you're too humble to admit that you have it in you, you're not likely to get there. You have to realize and level the playing field and see that the seer, the seeing and the seen are the same if you want to play in the same field of possibility.
