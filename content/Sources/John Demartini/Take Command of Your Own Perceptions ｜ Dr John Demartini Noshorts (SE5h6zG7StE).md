 I'm a firm believer that if you don't take command of your own perceptions and don't take command of your own chemistry, you'll probably have a deficiency of drugs in your mind. And you'll think you'll have to take some drug to take care of and balance it. But I find that most of the people that are relying on that are just unwilling to actually go back and discern what it is that's imbalanced in their mind. It's been, they've got so many stored in the subconscious mind, they're overwhelmed by all the different judgments and they're holding themselves back from actually knowing how to dissolve them. That's why I put together the Breakthrough Experience Program and the Demartini Method to help sift through those one by one and methodically balancing the chemistries and balancing the perceptions, the ratios of perceptions, then bringing them into appreciation and love again, which normalizes and heals the chemistry. And then the brain chemistry changes.
