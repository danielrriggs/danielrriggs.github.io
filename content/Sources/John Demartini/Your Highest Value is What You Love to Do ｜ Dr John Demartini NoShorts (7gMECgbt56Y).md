 My highest value is teaching. I am spontaneously inspired to teach each day. Nobody has to motivate me. Nobody has to remind me. Nobody has to incentivize me to get up and do what I love doing. Your highest value is what you love to do. And when you do it, you feel fulfilled. You're inspired. You're grateful. You're enthused. And you have more energy at the end of the day than when you start. You love it. Every single person on this planet has this. But not all people live it. Not all people live, or let's put it this way, attempt to live according to it. You're not the only one. You're the only one. You're the only one. You're the only one. You're the only one. You're the only one. You're the only one. You're the only one. You're the only one. You're the only one. You're the only one. You're the only one. You're the only one. You're the only one. You're the only one. You're the only one. You're the only one. You're the only one. You're the only one. You're the only one. You're the only one. You're the only one. You're the only one. You're the only one. You're the only one. You're the only one. You're the only one.
