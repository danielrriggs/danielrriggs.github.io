 I think anybody who thinks that they have full awareness while sitting on this little planet, if we go to the Sun looking at this little planet, which is only 8,000 miles in diameter, we can't even be seen. And if we go to the center of the galaxy, our solar system is not seen. So when we think of, you know, the many millions of galaxies that are in just a local universe, our awareness is not full, it's growing. It's a seedling in the universe. So I feel that that keeps me humble and keeps me on the growth and exploring new mysteries and finding the living order in those mysteries. But I stay, it's wise to be humble. The second we think we've got it, we finite at the infinite, we've stumbled upon a block in our life instead of kept being a stepping stone.
