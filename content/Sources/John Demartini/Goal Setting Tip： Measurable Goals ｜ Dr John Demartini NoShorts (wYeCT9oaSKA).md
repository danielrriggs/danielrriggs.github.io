 When it comes to, again, measurable, what's interesting is it's wise to make sure you set goals that are chumped down into small enough bites that you are able to take action without hesitancy. And measuring it is making sure you have something to metric the progress that you make and to be able to know when you're making progress, to be able to hone yourself in or on track with that goal. So measurable is important, metrics are important, but also making sure you break it down into smaller bites so you have milestones to see that you're on track and to know when you're often on track obtaining it.
