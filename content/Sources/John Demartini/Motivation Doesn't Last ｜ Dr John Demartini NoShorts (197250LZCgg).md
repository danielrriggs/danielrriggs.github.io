 And your life actually demonstrates your values because your values determine what you perceive, decide and act. And every decision you make is based on what you believe will give the greatest advantage of a disadvantage at any moment in time. So if you're not prioritizing your actions and not setting goals that align with what's highest on your value, you're going to require external motivation, which is transient and not lasting. And you're going to start and then stop. And you're going to lose momentum. And that is not how you achieve the greatness in life. You have to know exactly what your highest values are, your identity revolves around it. And that's what some people have called the calling in life. And if you get focused on that and prioritize your life and fill your day with the highest priority things and delegate lower priority things to other people who are inspired to do that, you'll build momentum, you'll automatically spontaneously be like that child with a video game. You can't wait to get up in the morning and do your service. If not, you're going to require motivation and motivation, I guarantee, will not last.
