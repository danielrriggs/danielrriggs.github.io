 My lateness is noted, as it were. Alright, it says we're alive. I'm assuming aliveness, although nothing's popped yet, so always one of those things. Ah, there we go. We are in fact alive. Woohoo! Welcome, welcome. So, welcome to Live Navigating Patterns again. And it's sort of an open forum today. Man, I am not prepared. I was busy arguing on the internet all day. So yeah, right up until live time. But yeah, there's a lot going on in the world today. And it seems like a lot of the struggles pretty much everywhere nowadays. And I do mean everywhere, which is sort of interesting. The struggles lately seem to be around structures and cooperation and what all that means in terms of how the world works. So you look at something like Crowder and Daily Wire and everyone's like, oh, Crowder shouldn't have to be involved with the Daily Wire that's owned by the powers that be. I don't even understand the framing. Like that's ridiculous. So I think that's one of the problems is that people aren't really engaging with the reality of how the world works. When you start to scale stuff, you have to change things. Scale to cooperate with people requires structure. That's what structures are. It's like structures are the way in which you cooperate with other people. Structures are the way in which we get along together with strangers. Whether that's the structure of being polite to people or a structure of a corporation or a structure of a nonprofit or a structure of a club, there's all these structures everywhere that we're bound to for whatever reason. And we need those things. We can't do without them. They're not optional. And everyone's complaining. And that's not appropriate. And money. Money is used to resolve some of these things. How do you trade value with people with different understandings of value? You use money. I think all currency is fiat. Money is not something to be demonized. Money is a good method of efficient trade or efficient barter is a better way to say it. And speaking of money, look, if you think that modern art is good, that's fine. You should pay me for what I put on my board. Like, if you think Jackson Pollock is good, that whiteboard, I mean, come on. That's next level right there. So I mean, and this is the problem. And then everyone's going to complain. You know the nor'ters. You need it with Pollock. By any standard. And this is the problem. Like, you're just picking arbitrary standards. And like, fair enough. But they're arbitrary. You need to understand your arbitrariness. You need to understand everybody else's too and appreciate it and appreciate it. Like structures are there because thousands of years of humans said structures are what you need to work. Right. Emergence only is not a thing. Like, this is not overly difficult to really comprehend. And everyone's upset about scale. You want to do things at scale, you have to make some sacrifices. And some of those sacrifices are simple things. Like you have to sacrifice to structure. You don't have a choice. That's why it's there. It didn't pop up because some mean guy at the top said, I'm going to impose a structure. That didn't happen. Like, people are just weird. And I think this comes from the collapse of complicated models of the world. I get it that people have told other people, you can understand the world by yourself. No, you can't. You're an idiot like the rest of us. We're all idiots. Can't understand the world by yourself. You can't understand a part of the world by yourself. You're too stupid. We're all too stupid. The collective intelligence, the result of the distributed cognition of living on the same planet and being roughly the same creatures means there are a bunch of things that individual creatures will never be able to understand. And that's probably most of the things as you get larger communities. Like, I don't understand how my city runs. I can understand parts of maybe somewhat how the city runs. Maybe I can see some of the structures. But like, I don't understand how it runs. Who actually makes the decisions? Is it really the town council or the mayor or whomever? Because it often isn't. That's why when politicians get in office, especially high office, and then the things you want don't happen, that's why. Because they don't have the power to do that. Because the person at the top can't just dictate things, or at least can't do that for very long before it collapses, a la Jordan Peterson. Right? Tyrannies are unstable, yes. Because your power as a single individual is less than the combined power of multiple individuals. It's not that hard, really. Right? And so, yeah, you can tell people to wear masks. But you can't make them wear masks. And some people will do it. And some people would do it anyway. Like, what's your point? Is it worse if somebody chopped down tells you to do something bad? Of course it is! Like, what? Nobody is denying that. But that doesn't mean you have to follow them. Like, you know, there's where the conflict is, or the overlap. That's where the problems are. Is that there's no way around certain things. There are constraints. Reality, part of the meaning of reality, is that which objects to your subject. It's subjective experience. So if your subjective experience has a nature, like you keep insisting that structures can emerge from nothing, and that still doesn't happen, you should say, you know what? Maybe reality says I'm wrong. You shouldn't consider that there's a way to make your idea work when it's been tried and failed. You should instead consider that your idea is stupid. Because it probably is. I don't have to say you give up the first time and things go horribly wrong, but look, at a certain point, you've got to have a cutoff where you say, you know what? I was just wrong about that. That's not how things work. So yeah, I mean, I just wanted to preface that. Because it's coming up everywhere. It's coming up in this little corner with the Cassidy livestream, which I haven't quite finished. But I find very interesting where Paul's struggling with what to do, and Jacob's got his plan, and Luke misunderstands everything about what Jacob's been saying and the problem at hand, which is the problem of how do you scale things? Well, if you want to scale value, you use cash. That's what you do. That's the way it's done. It's the way it's always been done. It has to be done that way for a reason. Not because random somebody in the past arbitrarily, that's a very postmodern way of thinking about how the world unfolded. There's a better way to understand how the world unfolded. It's called history. It's not that difficult. And this top down only or bottom up only, it's both. It has to be both. There is a both. There's a third option. Everyone's stuck in this binary thinking. It has to be all this or all that. That's because you're four years old and you don't understand that there's another option. And that option has a level of complexity that makes it hard. And you don't want a hard answer. Well, I got news for you. You live in a hard world that only has hard answers. Sorry. They're not the answers you think. Right? But they are the ones that are right there that are observable. All right, Manuel, what do you want to say about all this? Well, I think part of what I'm hearing is we're seeing the things in the world that we are busy with. Like, I've been experiencing that a lot. Yeah, like, oh, I'm struggling with this thing. And I'm like, oh, it's happening here. It's happening here. It's happening everywhere. And it's like you have this new framing and it's allowing you to find intelligibility in the world. And in some sense, it's real satisfying. But in the other sense, there might be a little bit of a deception going on. Like, there's a bias there. And so what it brought up for me is like, how do we figure out whether the discernment that we're seeing, whether we're actually converging towards something that's true or that we're just going into the fantasy of like, oh, now I can do all of these things. Right? Right. Yeah, well said. And I think that is part of the problem is that, look, this little corner of the internet is running into scaling problems. They are running into scaling problems. That's what they're running into. It's like, yeah, I want to do more in the world. Okay. Well, you need structure to do more in the world. It's not going to emerge. Or when structures emerge, they tend to corrupt instantaneously. Right? And you can't say, oh, the problem is charisma. Charisma exists in the world. You're not getting rid of it. You'd have to kill all the people to do that. Is that your... Okay. Well, then it's a problem. Yeah, it's a problem. How do you manage that problem? You don't manage it by trying to eliminate the thing that you can't eliminate. That doesn't make any sense. And this is where the problem comes in. Yeah. And I think if we're talking about charisma, right, like charisma is in some sense, right, like a natural flow of people that there's a spirit generated that people flow with. Right? And so what does that require? Well, that requires you to take responsibility of that spirit. Right? Like if you don't do something generative with it, then charisma is a problem. But charisma as such isn't a problem if handled correctly. Right? And so what everybody is doing is they're problematizing the thing before it is a problem. And we've been talking a lot about skepticism, cynicism. And well, the other one is communion. And I think, right, like so what is communion? It's the coming together. Right? Like that's the principle that you're trying to embody. Right? And when you're skeptical, you're like, well, are we sure what everybody is doing together is actually what we should be doing. Right? So now you're frustrating what is happening. Right? Like now sometimes things need to be frustrated. Right? But you already need to have a justification. Right? Like you need to have a place to stand if you're going to say that the thing that is happening shouldn't be happening. You need to provide an alternative because if you don't have an alternative, like you're not grounded in reality and like your objection isn't valid. Right? Like it doesn't mean that it's not true. It's just not valid because you don't have an answer that would resolve the issue. And then you come at the cynical place. Right? Like so that's the place of nihilism. Right? Like that's the place of disconnection. Because if you're cynical, you're actively rejecting the grounding that allows you to participate. Like there's a bunch of people that take that skepticism and they just get so wrapped up in it that they lose their connection to the world, to reality, and they end up cynical. And at that point you're in the postmodern narrative. Because you're rejecting everything. And what is all of this? Right? What is all of this? Right? There's really only two states. Right? There's the state of trying to connect and being connected. And there's the state of not being connected. Why? Because you reject an existing connection. Right? Or because you want to continually reject certain imperfections because you're an idealist. Right? And you end up just in rejective framing all the time. I reject this. I reject that. I reject these things. But why? Why? Why can't you find commonality and accept the difference? Because there's always going to be difference. When you get two people together, there's going to be differences. It's not that hard. Right? And that's the issue. Like, you have to learn to accept things that will say aren't going your way. You have to. You don't have a choice about it. And there's nothing wrong with that. But you have to kind of find a way to deal with it. If you want to cooperate with other people, you need to start using money for trade. If you want to start cooperating with other people, you need a structure. If you want to start cooperating with other people, their leadership is there. And you shouldn't wait for it to emerge because that's how bad things happened in the past. People waited for a leader to emerge. And look, every once in a while that goes great. But almost every other time, and that's most of the time, it goes very poorly. And that's not good. We don't want things to go poorly. So we have to accept. We have to submit. We have to acquiesce to the idea of structure, to the idea of money, to the idea of leadership, poor as it may be. And leadership is not a leader, although a leader might embody all of leadership, but not usually. Authority is another requirement. Structure can emerge. But you're better off with an aim, right? And you're better off with a leader, at least initially, who can plant the flag to rally around so that the structure can emerge properly towards the aim. That's the proper way to do things. It's always been the proper way to do things. If you think no one's ever tried another method, you're being completely naive about how the world works. People have tried lots of things. Just none of them worked. The things that we have are the things that we have because all the other things failed. Does that mean we found all the other things possible? No. But what are the odds that you found something possible and workable, not here and now, that no one else has discovered? They're vanishingly small because you're a muppet, just like the rest of us. Manuel's a muppet. I'm a muppet. We're all muppets. We're not going to find something new. It's not going to happen. And it doesn't need to. We can just fix what we have. Honest. Oh, we have a structure that's corrupt. The thing that corrupts structures are people. Find the corrupt people. Deal with that. Right? Flood the structure with non-corrupt people. Manuel is a muppet, apparently. Yes, I love it. I haven't used that feature yet, but that was a good use of it. Look, I mean, you've got it. You've got it. You will follow a leader. The fact that aspiration exists means that you are looking for an ideal all the time. And any ideal is a judge. And any ideal is leading you somewhere to something. That's happening. It's inevitable. And so you're constantly looking around for leadership. And not just in one place. But that's happening to you. And it's happening from within you. You're not getting around the problem. It's just a problem. And it's a perennial problem, as Vickie would call it. And you just need to engage with it. And be careful. How do you be careful? You be careful by having an aim that's greater than the thing you're trying to do. That's how you be careful. And that's how you get to the point where you're not going to be able to do it. That's how you're going to be able to do it. That's how you're going to be able to do it. So, yeah, I was really intrigued by this idea. We're objecting, we're objecting, we're objecting. And what causes us to object? Well, it's misapplying relevance. That's what puts us in an objecting mode. Because if we know what's relevant, we know we have to be careful. We have discernment about what we should reject and what we should accept. And then if we're in this confusion that we, in some sense, need to know everything about what we're doing, or we need to have a full plan, or we can't adapt on the fly because everything always gets adapted on the fly. What is this fear about having to have all of these things sorted? What is important is that you're in the right spirit, that when problems occur, you have the capacity to resolve them. That's the important part. It's not important that you have a structure that anticipates all the problems because it's impossible. And so I think there's an anxiety in people where... I was actually making this comment to Hader Haing. We need faith to participate in things that we don't understand. So if we're participating in a group, the likelihood that we can understand the whole group and what they're doing, what the motivations of each individual are is really, really low. But it's also not necessary because we can participate in faith until a problem occurs. Now there's a frustration, and that frustration needs to be resolved. And yes, the world is big and problems may occur that nobody in the group sees coming, and then they're in front of you and then they're a big deal. But that's going to happen. We were talking to Sally Jo earlier today and she was saying, I anticipated so many problems and all of those problems didn't happen. But you know what? A bunch of other problems did happen. That's the problem with anticipating problems. You can't anticipate all the problems. It's just impossible. And it's hard to anticipate the right problems. And bad news, you can't do that. Good news, you don't need to. There's no reason to do that. You can deal with things as they come. Honest, it can be done, which is not to say don't try to anticipate any problems, but you really don't need to. It's really not that difficult. And people don't realize that. They're always trying to, there we go. That's that's piratey enough, I guess. They're always trying to get in front of things and anticipate for no reason. There's no, and it's something, even if there's a reason, maybe you can't. Maybe you can't. Maybe you're just not smart enough. And that's almost always true. And you've made the audience happy, Manuel. I know. But that's the core issue is, you know, everyone's worried about these things. They have no control over. It's like, no, be stoic. Like, yeah, there's tons of things you have no control over. There's so many things you have no control over that you don't know how many things there are that you have no control over. And so you can worry about that if you want, or you can try to anticipate the impossible if you want, or you can spend that time, energy and attention somewhere else doing something positive, being generative, moving towards a common goal, for example. Like, it's up to you, really. Like, it is up to you. That's where you have the choice. So you should choose wisely. Right. You shouldn't choose randomly. You should choose very wisely. And that's people don't want to do that. Choice at that level is hard. Like, I totally get it. But also, that is the way it is. Like, at a certain point, you bump up against constraint. And one constraint is scale. You can only be friends with so many people personally. You can only interact with so many people personally. You can only trade time, energy and attention with so many people personally. After that, you have to pay people. You know, it just is what it is. Or if you want so much of their time that it takes away from them earning money, you have to pay people. Like, none of these things are avoidable. So that's how it is. Oh, there's Laura. Hey, Laura. Good to see you. So, yeah, my Facebook thing has has has garnered attention. Go on, Manuel. Sorry. Go on, Facebook. You can participate in the social media battle. So, yeah, it's the participation in wisdom. Like, wisdom is the thing that in some sense constrains the faith that you're applying, right? Because wisdom allows you to have a relationship to things that are unknown to you in some sense. Like, it allows you to to anticipate, yeah, like anticipate what's what's likely to go wrong or like what direction to take and whether you're still on course towards that direction. So it's important that you don't go in with blind faith. And I think there's a lot of people and I talked about this with Paul in the last live stream we did that have been burned in our lives, right? They've participated in faith with people and then they ended up that they were participating with bad people. And now they're skeptical about people or people that went bad. I mean, the other thing, nobody accounts for time. Like, sometimes people are good and then they go bad because they get traumatized. Like, and that's the and that's the problem. Like, it's just hard. You can't count on these little little, you know, tricks to get around things. Yeah. And so I think I think we shouldn't be naive. Like, nobody should be naive. But, but like, there, there is there is a level at which things are out of our control. Right. And we have some control about the things that are out of our control. And that that control is whether we participate with them or not. Right. And, yeah, we should apply that wisely. But but when you're too skeptical, right, like when then you're denying yourself two things, right, like you're denying yourself actual potential, but you're also denying yourself the opportunity to grow. Like, you're denying yourself to get to the place where you do have the discernment that you shouldn't have. Like, I think what what we should be facilitating is a place, a safe space, unfortunately, using that wording, but a safe space where we can participate in in certain spaces in a certain way and and not get burned by them. Right. And then, like, then the question becomes, well, what is being burned? Right. Like, with some people, they, they have a bunch of baggage with them. Right. And like, Mark likes to say, reality is that which objects. Right. And so if if you if you get faced with reality, that's not a burn. Right. Like, a burn is when someone is doing something extra over that. Right. Like, when when they're screwing you up. And that's maybe one of the most important discernment. Right. Like, is the thing that's happening to me right now. Is that a consequence of that? What I want isn't possible. Or is it the consequence of someone frustrating me in my design? How's it going, Jesse? Good to see you. Hello. Yeah. Yeah. Last week was, um, that was a thing. Seven hours, seven and a half hours, seven hours, over six hundred and eight views between the two channels. I don't know, dude. I've got no I was not expecting anything like that. It was a great conversation and everybody check it out. There was no part of it that wasn't awesome. We had a little 20 minute interlude of of headbutting, maybe. But, you know, yeah. Well, well, look, I mean, I've got to I've got to buy me coffee. So if you think Jackson Pollock is high art and pay me for mine, I get to that. There's so many points in that conversation where it's like, OK, this is my first time I'm new here. I'm not now objectionable to be. I want to be that person that listens. It's funny that the conversation kind of ended on that point of the value of listening, the value of participating. So that was interesting. There's also a thread about people in nihilism and how to help them with that. I think that would be one thing I'd want to pick up. I've been thinking about this. I've already seen half of the meeting crisis versus the faith crisis videos. So sorry, I've been seeing the whole thing. That's OK. I wanted to put forward is the idea that there may be a crisis above the two, which I'm kind of terming the crisis. Yeah, there's two. There's two crises. I don't think they're related to the materialism. That's my view. But yeah, I think there might be one above it, though. I think there might be a meta crisis that you could call the attention crisis or for the Christians, the worship crisis. I see. I would. The thing that precedes the meaning crisis and the crisis of faith is the intimacy crisis. Right. And I've got two videos on that one's on Andrew with the Bangs channel and the other one is on navigating patterns with Catherine, the diva of Thunder Bay, who also does the marriage crisis chats with Paul Vanderclay. She and her husband, you came and do those chats. So those videos. So she's she's she's kind of all over the intimacy thing in some sense, whether she realizes it or not. And yeah, I mean, I think that's important. And it's interesting, too. So we have a you know, we have a we have sort of a comment here. I think this is always excellent. It was great. But my theory is views go up with women. Sure. And so the thing that I was going to cover and I'll just cover briefly here just because it's fun and interesting and hopefully useful for people. I use very, very, very simple models to understand the world. It's just that they're way better than political and economic and all these other stupid framings that don't work and end up too complex. The way the world actually works is men are augs and women are women. Right. All the build, aug smash. That's it for aug. That's the entirety of aug. Build smash. That's it. Aug doesn't aug not right. Aug not know what build what smash aug just build smash. Women point. That's what they do. They point. So women point aug either builds or smashes. Sometimes aug smash when aug build aug sorry. Right. Sometimes aug build when aug should smash aug sorry. That's it. That's the whole thing. It's really that easy. And when you start thinking of it that way, because men are going to be active and they're also they're not they're not convicted. Right. Women are convicted. That's why they don't have a meaning crisis, but they do have an intimacy crisis because they're looking for intimacy. And that causes them to run around and do things that aren't permanent because they're trying to get intimacy through an immediate act rather than a commitment. Right. Because we don't need commitments in the modern era or error is probably better better said. Right. We don't need commitments. We can just come and go as we please and do things when we want. There's no long term anything anyway. So, you know, but that's the that's the nihilism sneaking up on you whether you realize it or not. Right. And that's the and that's the problem is when you don't have that sense, you run into that you run into that problem that trouble. And I mean, I think I showed it last time. Right. The man and the woman and the holding, you know, holding hands and all that that. I mean, that's the archetype of of odd versus woman. Yeah. Well, boy, we worked on that for months. You know, thankfully, we have Sally Jones so ridiculously talented. Yeah. I mean, that's the problem is to lack of intimacy underlying all of these issues. Sorry, Jesse. Is that connected to the left hand, right hand symbolism? So left hand is the open hand. The right hand is the hand that I think it is in some ways. I think that that's binary thinking. So that's a problem. I would say maybe maybe. Yeah. That's binary thinking. I mean, it's too. That's binary thinking. Right. Dualism is wrong, by the way, in case anybody didn't get that. It's just wrong. I have a video on binary thinking, on navigating patterns. Anyway. Yeah. So I think that the the the way this shows up, right. If you think of the world in terms of what John Brevicki calls opponent processing, OK, what you're doing is you're submitting to the flat space and saying there's one axis and one side of the axis is fighting for the most control of the axis over the other side. Now that can be internal in your opponent processing, as it's called, right. By John. Or that can be external, as in you and I or maybe Manuel and I. Manuel and I fight all the time. So that's that's pretty normal. Right. But but that doesn't have to be the way of it. You can have cooperative processing. Well, what's the difference in opponent processing? One of you has to submit to the other period. It's a binary system. You have no other options. It's very postmodern power narrative. Power from above. Power is everything. That's wrong. Right. The thing that you can do and the thing the woman does for odd is point up at something bigger. So once you get off of the axis that you're stuck on, you can both submit or sacrifice something. And from that emerges something bigger. And now you've changed from an axis into a triangle. Right. Technically. And and in submission, because you give up a little something, the other side gives up a little of something. Right. Now all of a sudden you've created a space above you both where you can both be better than you could when you were stuck on the flat plane. And it's like it's remarkable to me that people don't automatically kind of know this. And that's cooperation. And that's how the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Right. If you're stuck on a flat plane and you're an opponent processing mode, the whole you can't create a whole that's greater than the sum of the parts. You only have the parts in order to have a whole greater. You need to go up. It's that simple. So to go to an example, when I argue with Mark, right, like what I'm trying to do is to figure out what what is the reason that we're not agreeing. Right. Like there's there's something that I cannot see. Right. And that Mark cannot see. Right. Because else we could explain to each other where the disagreement is. Right. So that means that there's something hidden in. Yeah. In in in our reasoning. And when when you make that assumption, right, like, oh, I assume that Mark is actually seeing something correctly. Right. Like, I don't think he's diluted. And I'm also seeing something correctly. Right. But now, like, what what what is explaining the distinction? Right. And if you're in that space, then you're you're opening up. Right. Like you're pointing at at something outside of the conflict to resolve the conflict. And that's the way to be generous. If if you're if you're going to be like, oh, I'm right because of whatever like whatever justification you want to put in there. Then you you're you're diminishing it to zero sum gain. Right. Right. And. So the whole OK. This is where I have a tendency to maybe say something spicy. So I'll try and be I'll try and try to be succinct. Does this connect to the idea of down with patriarchy? If the patriarchy is a symbolically a triangle and what they're after is a reflattening of all the. Yes. The social the association spaces. Yeah. So they want to be equal. Why do you want to be equal? Let's suppose you buy into the postmodern power narrative. What's the trick they're playing on you with the postmodern power narrative? They're not giving you an alternative. All they're telling you is that these people have the power, but you could take it away from them. They're not changing the system at all. They're not saying they're not telling you there's a different system. They're not saying that the system changes. What they're saying is different people need to be in charge of the power. They're not changing the game at all. And that's what people are falling for because they want to be equal. They want to have the power. OK, well, you want to have the power, but the power didn't go away. And what if you're not perfect? And I don't know about you, Jesse, but I'm not perfect. Are you perfect? Manuel? Yes. And the problem is Manuel for president can confirm the problem. The problem is right. Like what they're doing is they're they're basing authority on lived experience. So if you have if you have suffered, you've had a revelation, right? Like you have an understanding of the world that is inaccessible to the other person. And therefore you have a valid point of view that needs to be included in in the understanding of the world. Right. Which which makes it a relativistic framing, right? Like they're they're changing the authority from reality, right? That which objects to the person. Right. And now we we can't have a shared reality anymore, right? Like we can't have a shared authority. So now we need to play as authority in the person. And now we get into this power game. Right. And that's that's a struggle that you end up getting into. And that's that's where the far lies. Like if you if you take the authority away from reality, then you end up being stuck. Yeah. And that's that's really the problem. And I thought, you know, we had a good we had a good chat. I pasted it in there with with Van der Kley, who did a live stream. And that was fun. That was fun. And then I saw, like I said earlier, most of Cassidy's live stream today. And it was interesting because Jacob sort of revealed more of what he was up to. But his usual bombastic statements that are going to go over like a lead balloon, as always. And and Paul was also struggling with monetizing things. And so they were having a conversation over well, is it really right to do that? And, you know, they were denying structure because people love to deny structure. And the whole thing is kind of crazy. He's a minister. If he's a minister, what do you do with ministers? Like you have to they're giving up their time, energy, attention and love. Right. Wouldn't you want to contribute to that? If they're well, that's the thing. Right. That's the thing. People don't understand. Like if you want strangers to contribute, it has to be money. There's no choice. Right. There's no better way to do it. Right. There's no better way to do it. But yeah, it has to be a currency value. Right. And you could give back help. You can. You can. Yeah, you can always do that. But a thousand people can't do that. Then it's too many. Right. So like I said, like the efficient way to do that is actually money. And of course, introducing money introduces problems. But yeah, it's a trade off. But if you don't want to scale, that's fine. But if you want to scale, you have to make a trade off. Like you don't have a choice. And people are bumping this little corner, bumping into a scaling problem. Yeah. Well, they don't want any of the bad things that happen due to the scaling. Well, that's too freaking bad. Then you can't scale. You pick one. Either you scale with the tools that we know that have worked for thousands of years, or you don't scale and you shut up. I don't care which, but it's got to be one of the two. Yeah. And also if you're helping, you're no longer a stranger. And if you're helping, you need to structure to help within because else you're not helping. That's simple. You cannot have an organized effort without an organized organization. Pretending that individuals doing an individual thing is actually a thing. It's not. I've been getting into this looking at the idealism, which is effectively you have something in your head and then you're going to act out as if that's true. Without having a body for it. That's effectively what it is. Because when you have something in your head, the thing that the other person has in their head is going to be different. You can say and you can talk about it and you can pretend that it's the same, but it cannot be the same. And then the only way that you can participate in the same thing is when you have a spirit and that spirit is the thing that you're joining up in. You can't say the thing out of my head is going to make the spirit. That's not how it works. So there's a bunch of things. When I think I'm doing this, when I make this video, I am contributing to this project. Are you sure? First of all, does the project exist? Secondly, how do you know that you're actually contributing? Why are you diverting attention away from it? That might be possible. There's many ways in which your contribution can be actually negative because it's not integrated in the whole. You need a whole that literally defines your role in it. And if you don't have a way to define your role, you're lost. You don't have grounding and you don't have a way to understand your participation. Why do, okay, putting out an assumption, say that millennials, my generation, struggle with this idea of membership in some aspects of life, but also are very open to it and want to contribute to others, i.e. YouTube influences. It's unavoidable. They're just admitting to themselves that they're making the same trade off here and not making it here. That's really all it is. You have to. You don't have a choice. Oh, we're stuck in the machine. Okay. Yeah. Now what? Your option isn't I'm going to unstuck from the machine. So if that's your framing, which I think is terrible framing and a stupid way to think about it, but also irrelevant. So what? You're not getting out of it. I mean, there's nihilism, but that's just suicide. And if that's where you're going, go there, but don't stay here and bitch. Just make the choice and be done. It's not that hard. It really isn't. So what's going on with this membership dilemma? Is it failure to associate or failure to initiate the process? They're wanting to be involved or they kind of not wanting the responsibility of being involved? They don't have a good model of the world. No, it's just this is just a model of the world problem. They don't have a good model of the world. All right. Like if you think that your alternatives really are be part of big media, which includes the daily wire somehow magically, or be small like Steven Crowder. And those are the only two options because Steven Crowder is a rebel because he's doing it all on his own, which isn't true. He's got like 30 freaking people. He's a small corporation. It's still a corporation. Like, OK, small businesses and large businesses don't work the same. Yeah, don't tell me about that. I did consulting for years. I've worked at Fortune 500's guy. I've been in C-suite meetings with executives, with CEOs. I've seen how they make decisions. It's not as impressive as you would think. And there's no cigars. Not once. Never. Never never dark rooms and cigars. Right. And and I've watched them scheme and try to run things. Power down. Power down. Journey from the top. And it never works. And in cases where it does work, it works like six months and then they're gone. Like that actually happens. Sorry. And I've actually seen it personally, physically myself. And it happens all the time. But again, if you want to cooperate with people, you need a structure. And yeah, you know, you don't want to give it up. You want to you want to keep your individualistic rebellious spirit. But you know what? You can't. That's why you cooperate in some areas where you never think about it. You don't you don't think about the performative contradiction. And in other areas you go, well, I don't want to cooperate in that way in this area. It's like, well, but that's nice. But cooperation only works one way. It doesn't matter if it's this area or that area. And so you can't be you can't be crowder and say, well, you guys are really under control of big check. You know, you can't you can't. I commented to one guy, I said, you know, you can't sit there and say we have no choice about the algorithm and then say daily wires using the algorithm to their advantage. Like if daily wire is a force for good and they're using the algorithm to their advantage and they have no choice but to be subject to the algorithm, then their will and agency towards the good is being forced on the algorithm, which is actually happening, by the way. So why are you upset about that? It's for the good. Even if you don't like daily wire, the fact that they're manipulating the algorithm by your own admission means that it's for the good because you think the algorithm is evil. Like, I don't get it. Like, why is this a conflict? It's not a conflict. You don't have to view it that way. You get this simple mind where it's like, oh, no, fifty million dollars is too much money and people will have five hundred million and could pay fifty million, but don't pay. It's all nonsense. And then these other people, like I heard a comment today where somebody was saying, oh, you know, these guys, you know, what was it? Michael Jordan, you know, he made hundreds of millions of dollars or whatever, right? Well, the people who ran the NBA made billions. I don't think the NBA's ever made a billion dollars ever, ever. Certainly no member, no team in the NBA's ever made a billion dollars. That doesn't happen. Sports is a money losing operation for the owners. In almost all cases for almost all sports is a few exceptions, but they're tiny and they don't make a lot of money. Sorry, they don't. Sports team owners own sports teams for ego, guy, not for money. They happen to be rich. Why? Because it costs a lot of money to buy and run a sports team. And that's the like they're not making billions of dollars. It's a billion dollar industry. That doesn't mean anyone's getting a billion dollars out of it. It means there's a billion dollars spread amongst all the people there. And some of those people may be making three hundred thousand dollars a year. And some of those people may be making three dollars an hour. And some of those people may be volunteers because I haven't met a business yet where that wasn't true. I've never met a business where there wasn't a spread from zero to some ridiculous amount of money within the business ever, ever closed market, isn't it? Because you're only the sports teams that are doing well are the top five. The bottom five sports are not. They're losing money. They have to they have to spend more money to get back up to the top to get back to the. That's right. Well, and and and they bought in at some point. That's the issue. Like, it was funny when the I forget the team. It was the one of the L.A. basketball team. I think it is what it was. One of the one of the NBA teams and the owner had gotten the current owner. It had gotten caught making a comment about immigrants or something when his wife was an immigrant and whatever. It's a big dust up. And he said, well, I'll sell the team for two billion dollars. And the team wasn't worth two billion dollars on paper by any stretch of the imagination. Steve Bomber came in and bought the team. And a friend of mine was like, oh, he must have a plan for making back two billion dollars. And I was like. You do understand that Steve Bomber is worth 20 billion dollars and that is 10 percent of his wealth. Show me a human being that doesn't spend 10 percent of their wealth on a luxury item, whether it be a once in a lifetime vacation or there are zero people like that. OK, he just had 10 percent of his income just happens to be two billion dollars. Like, it's not that hard, you know. And look, Anselman, I love you, but you're kind of missing the point. Amateur sports doesn't exist. They're all businesses. The only difference between amateur sports and non amateur sports is who makes what money when. And this is why college sports is an issue, right, because it's right in the middle and everyone's like, well, college sports is worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year per school, which is also correct, by the way. And that's the problem is that. Well, if if if that's what's happening, what does that mean? Well, easy. It means that the world is more complex than people just wanting to make money. Right. Bad news. The worldview is more complex. Good news. People aren't just greedy just because they buy things or have money. That's not what's happening. And sometimes people buy things to cooperate with other people. You know, you can you can look at Elon Musk and say, what do you love about? Why do you love Musk by Twitter, which I have a video on on navigating patterns, by the way. Right. Why do you love Musk by Twitter? Well, maybe he wanted to help the world. Everyone's bitching about billionaires and how they could use their money to save the world. And here he does allocate a few billion dollars to save the world. And what does everybody do? They get cynical and bitchy at him. What are you doing? You're trying to take over the world. But you just told him as a billionaire, it's his responsibility to do these sorts of things. And now you're bitching about it. I still I still think there's a lot of credit to Elon just buying Twitter for Babylon B to get back on. I still think that that has 40 percent of an argument. I think he kind of did it as a lull. And then he's like, well, I can do X next thing and maybe it'll help my AI training because there's all this data. People don't do things for single reasons. Ever. Ever. It never happens. People have to have an ego reason to do something. People have to have a reason outside of themselves to do something. Right. A justification. Right. And then they have to have a potential in it. Because if it's not which isn't to say like, you know, people don't buy businesses to kill them because they do. They need motivations like, oh, I'm going to use it, you know, to Phoenix's point as a tax shelter. Right. Oh, I'm going to use it as this. Right. And that's and that's the problem. Yeah. So I want to go back to this remark. Growing is a form of dying. So expansion. The problem with growth is like, are we choosing to grow or is our growth an adaption to something that's already true? Right. Because like sometimes we're in a situation and like things are already happening. And what is required of us is to keep up. Right. Like we need to evolve into this higher layer of participation because, well, we're in a more complex game. And so when we're talking about these choices and about these framings, like. Are is is what we're choosing? Is it actually a choice or is it just a natural step? And are we resisting the natural progression of the game that we're in? And and so this this goes back to submit and write and surrender like like, are you are you playing the game? Like, are you aware of the game that you're in? Are you aware of the rules that you're under, the influences that you're participating with? Because if you're not aware of these things, you're irresponsible. Like, you're effectively going into places blind and you're just hoping that things will magically manifest in the right way. But like that's like that might even be true. Right. But you can still take responsibility and help manifest things in the right way. So even even if that's your belief, right, like there's still a responsibility on on you to to make these things happen. Right. And yeah, like that that's that's the hard part. Right. It's like, OK, like I'm in this situation. And like I didn't choose to be here. Right. Like I just happened to get here for whatever reason. And like now I have an option. Like, do I play the game that that is presented to me or am I going to be skeptical? Right. Like, am I going to say, well, I don't really know if I want to play this game. Right. And what are you doing? You're creating distance between you and reality. Right. Like you're you're you're frustrating. You're creating what is there and and all in order to what for you to make a judgment that you're you're incapable of making. Right. Like you can also participate in like at a point where you're like, well, like this isn't working for me. Like you can step up. But it's a fundamental attitude. And we've been talking about protest Protestants. Right. Like what what does it mean to protest? To protest is to look at the game. This is what for Vickie talks about. It's like taking off your glasses. Like, oh, what is the thing that I'm participating in? And then saying, well, I don't like the glasses. Like they they have the wrong color. It's like, yeah, but now you don't have glasses. Like you can reject your glasses all you want. Right. But like you need to have a new set of glasses before you do that, because else you end up in this limbo. That's just not a good space to be. And and coming to that acceptance, right. Like it's really sucks. But like you're you're stuck. Right. Like the fact that you're in reality means that you're in all sorts of games or situations and and they're just there. And you can either participate with them or you can reject them. But are you manifesting the good if you're doing enough groups grow? All groups grow at some point. It's just a matter of time. It's an edge. Right. Right. Well, not all of them, but they should grow. Like if you're trying to do something, I guess I'm trying to also. Well, you can do. Yeah. But I mean, some things do remain stable over time. I mean, there are groups that have that try to keep a membership of a certain size all the time. And they're very successful at that. So they don't really fluctuate much. And that's fine and fair. But like there's a then there's a limit. Like scale talks about the limit of reality of what you're doing. You're not going to build a skyscraper with a group of five people. It's not going to happen. It's not going to happen. That's all. And maybe you don't need to build a skyscraper. That's fine. And don't build a skyscraper. But don't get together and advertise building a skyscraper and then limit your group size to five. I know now you've transgressed and that's really the issue. Right. I mean, this is the issue that we discussed with Van der Kley before. If you didn't want to have these problems, you shouldn't have had a YouTube channel. It's that simple. Like having the YouTube channel causes the problems. What is the problem again? Can we restate it or re-framing it? It's scaling. Right. Oh, I want to help a lot of people. OK, I want to help a lot of people I don't know and get to know new people. OK, fine. They're two different desires. They're actually two very different conflicting desires. You can't prioritize them at the expense of the other. You can't meet new people. Well, no, no, no, no. All desires conflict. This is the problem. You have a limit on your time, energy and attention. The question is, how are you resolving that conflict? When it's you and five people, it's easy to do. When it's you and ten people, it's easy to do. When it's you and a hundred people, it can be done. It's not easy to do anymore. It can be done. Right. When you want to reach the population of a city. No. Now you need a structure. You can't do that the same way. The scale has changed. And because the scale has changed, the method of interaction has to change. So, for example, you need a structure. If you want to allow new people in, you have to have a gatekeeper or a gatekeeping system within the structure. There's no choice about that. It's not an optional thing. Cassidy was doing a live stream today and she let somebody on that she didn't know. And he immediately put on a video image of two animals doing the deed. And she had to kick it off really quick, which is fine. Right. But there's no way around that. And that's the problem is that either you have a gatekeeping system or you're going to have random people come in and just to ruin your thing. And this is one of those problems where people just assume that everyone's good. Everyone is not good. People like power. People who are bought into the postmodern power narrative would just assume come on your stream and ruin it for everybody because that gives them the feeling of power, whether it's real or not, is not important. They think it's real. It's real enough to them to invest their time, energy and attention in destruction. And I can tell you from experience, building things is really, really hard relative to destroying things. You can bring me anything, particularly an argument, although maybe that's unfair because I'm really good at that. I can annihilate it in seconds. Any argument you want to bring. Go ahead. Bring it all. You know what? Bring it all. Having read a whole bunch of books I haven't read, I will still tear it apart and you will not even understand what hit you because, A, it's easy. B, I got skills. Right. But software. I can write software. That's easy for me. I can write a few thousand lines of code. I've done it many times. Right. I don't tend to write anything that big, partly because I like efficiency and partly because I hate large projects and I don't work on them generally even on my own. Right. But if you want to engage with a large software project, you need a structure that enables that. And the larger it is, maybe you need a different structure than if it's smaller. And all the way down, like at all levels, because I've worked in the software industry for decades. And I can tell you exactly how this works and how it doesn't work. And that's the problem. Like when you get to a different scale, things change. And when you pass that scale, things change. And when you scale down, things change. And you need different structures and different management styles and different coding style and different. Like everything changes. It's not just one or two things. It's not a tweak. It's not a tweak. So can you successfully deconstruct? Because you made that point, I think, to Paul on Twitter. There's no such thing as deconstruction. And, you know, I have to apologize. I keep meaning to reach out to to our friend from Iceland, who actually one day we never see him anymore. Dalamard is his handle on Discord. We never see Dalamard anymore. But one day he came in and I forget which Discord server it was. And he said deconstruction makes no sense grammatically. And he just ripped apart the whole word and said and gave like, I think what we're actually for real all the reasons, like actually a complete accounting, because sometimes he does that. He's very bright, very, very smart. And I was like, wow. And then I was like, I didn't write any of that down. I feel like a retard. And then I was like, damn it. And now I'm ever since I've been in the Discord server, I've been like, damn it. And now I'm ever since then, I've been like, I need to remember all those points. Right. But basically, there's something magical about construction, about building something that can't be reversed. And it's something like the element of faith that is in that, that is presupposed by the act of construction. And so it doesn't make any sense that you're going to unconstruct it, which would be the proper term. So I would say even unconstruction is incorrect. Your only option is destruction. Why? Because you are destroying the spirit that was built in the faith of the idea that that object could exist as a whole greater than the sum of the parts. And so there's no such thing as deconstruction. What you're describing is destruction. And destruction is always negative. Now, people get confused. And this is actually a comment I made. I don't know if it was Twitter or one of the YouTube comments, because I've been all over the Internet today going frickin' hog wild, as everybody I'm sure can tell. I've also had a terrible day. I feel like complete garbage, which is why I have like drinks galore over here. But what I was saying was you're confusing the idea of, oh, I know. It was a comment to Jacob on Twitter, right? You're confusing the idea. Paul, talking about Paul Antler talking about. Yes. Yes. The spiral thing. Right. And this whole idea that criticism could be generative. No, it's not. The fact that after you criticize, you can generate doesn't mean criticism is generative. Those are two separate actions. You can't tie the two together, because just criticizing is not generative, as Manuel pointed out earlier in the stream. The bottom line is if you engage in a process where you are criticizing something without an alternative solution, and this is well known in business, maybe you shouldn't be criticizing it, because even if you're right, who cares? What are you going to do about it? And is it correct for you to burden somebody with your problem? I see this problem. Well, maybe everybody else always saw that problem, and the reason why it's not fixed is because nobody knows how to fix it, and you bringing it up just makes you a jerk, quite honestly. Like, if you don't have a solution, why are you bringing this up? And I'm not saying you should never bring up problems, but I am saying, like, maybe don't presume that there isn't a good reason for the problem. Like, maybe don't presume that it's not part of reality or a known trade-off that had to be made, because a lot of times I hear, and especially with software people, because that's the industry I know the best, they're constantly like, well, you could do it this way instead. Yeah, but then you have to do all these other things too. Like, you're just, it's not like it's any easier. You're just trading off who gets the bad end of the stick at some point. I don't know what point that is, but that always happens. Like, everything's always in trade-off mode, and if you don't appreciate that, then you're going to go astray. Hmm. Okay, so can I try and tie this back to something? Because last week we talked about, okay, people are in nihilism, they're in matilarism, how to help them. And I suggested one of the ways to, you can start when people are difficult, when they're deep down the well, is you try and listen to them. You try and get them to scare themselves with their own position that they're in, and you can see how deep and dark. One of the other things I've tried to help people with is try to get them back to a sense of the poetic or symbolic, and try to get them to recognize patterns in life. Where this comes in contact with this idea of criticism, and is it valid, or the methods of criticism, is you need to criticize in order to point out patterns, but how do you criticize that point up, not down, or not just across it? Like you can criticize in a way that kind of flattens the space again, it takes away authority, or maybe it needs to take away authority, that can be valid. But how do you navigate that? Because you need to show people patterns to get them to the next stage, as you said, of the symbolic knowing of the world that kind of re-spiritualizes things, in a big sense of spirituality. Re-enchants. I don't know if I've... I want new words for that. I don't like re-enchantments. No, no, that's enchantment. That's what enchantment is. I like spiritual because I think it kind of catches people of God in some aspects. It has to make them think about what spiritual means. It can. It can also make your eyes glaze over. Or it can make them adversarial. Yeah. Yeah, true. I guess, yeah. Maybe the people I regularly talk to are already in the process, so I don't have to worry about them. The people that are already in the shadow realm. Yeah, it's... I'm trying to kind of put something in a frame for you guys to consider. Like how do we get criticism inside of this pattern recognition model? Because you need people that critique things and protest things, but how do you do it in such a way that... Nobody don'ts. No, you don't, actually. That's the... No. No, you don't. Okay. No. I'm trying to live. I'm trying to live. Yeah, there's no reason for that, right? And I'm not saying don't do it, and it's never appropriate, but I'm saying you don't actually need that. For cooperation, you need the opposite. And the problem, and the thing that I do, for example, is I can say something like, I understand that you have a worldview, right? But it doesn't work. And then I show them their worldview doesn't work in some important way, right? And then I say, but there's an alternate worldview that you can use, right? Have you thought about it this way? Right? Now, that increases the complexity, because whatever worldview they have that's broken is broken because it's too small to hold the world. It's not hard, right? And so how do you get them into that complexity? And one way to attract people to complexity is to say something like, this is enchanting, because people want enchantment. They want to be able to go forward in the world, right? They want these ways of interacting, right? They want all of that. And that's the issue, is that without that, they have a problem, basically. And that problem is that their worldview is not serving them. That's why they're angry. Like, you're not in a meaning crisis. You can be in a meaning crisis and not realize it, but you're not in a meaning crisis in any sense if you don't have a problem that needs to be solved. So criticism can be a false enchantment? Okay. Well, hold on, Manuel. Let me finish. Criticism is the assumption that you're smart enough to do the critiquing, right? That's the postmodern lie, is that you're an individual and you're so smart that you can look at something that was built before you were built, right? Or a pattern that's being followed. Maybe the pattern is new, but it's a pattern that is as old as time itself, maybe. Who knows? Or at least as old as humanity. And that you can understand that well enough to have a valid critique of it, okay? Now, anybody can have a critique. Three-year-olds do it all the time. And this is literally my complaint about the postmoderns. They are nothing more. And I mean this technically. I'm not being hyperbolic. The entire summary of postmodernism is the same as a three-year-old's. Why? Why? It is 0% different from that. It is the presumption that you are smart enough to question everything around you. And so I tell people all the time, are you sure you're smart enough to understand that well enough to make the critique? Now, the advantage that I have is just purely experiential. I've just experienced a lot of things. I've learned a lot of things in my life. And I have a good memory. When they come up with a critique, I can tell them why it's wrong instantly. Because I've already engaged in all these things, usually with other people. It's amazing the arrogance of people too. Because they very often assume that they're going to come up with some construction for their ridiculous worldview, which I've already divined in four questions or by listening to four statements that they've made, that is going to somehow convince me that their worldview is correct because it's the first person that's ever told me this stupidity. And I've taken to telling people up front, you're not going to find an example I haven't heard. I'm very sorry. This is your first time talking with somebody who's skeptical of your worldview, but it's not my first time talking to somebody with your idiotic idea. And that's really the problem is I'm just at an advantage. You know, like house advantage. Please come join me. Let's put some money down though, because that would be more fun. So that's the issue is they assume they can critique. But why are you making that assumption? What if you're not smart enough to critique? I wanted to reframe it a little bit, right? Because what do you need? You need a talent, right? You need a purpose. So when you're doing something, right? Like when the spirit is moving, is it going towards the purpose? Right. Like if it's not going towards the purpose, like you don't need to critique. Right. Like what you need is you need to troubleshoot. You need to find a way to course correct or to change the spirit. Like that's also an option. Right. But yeah, you want to have a course correct. Right. So what you get is you have a justification. Right. You have a purpose within your critique. Right. And what does the purpose do? Right. Like it organizes everything. Like it puts everything in a structure and everybody can have agreement. Right. Because they're all participating in the same spirit. Right. So they have the same discernment as the other people. So a critique is. So that again, I think that was good. I just kind of jumped to the next thing. Yes. That's what I did. So when everybody is in the same spirit, right? Like they're looking at the same things, right? Like when Peterson says when you walk across the room to get water, right? Like the table is an obstacle, right? Like the glass is the means by which you get water. Right. So everything gets a form as a consequence of the purpose that you're embodied. Right. And other people can share that observation. Right. Because like they also struggle with the table. They also need something to hold the water. Right. Now, depending on your experience, right? Like you might not understand that glasses hold water. Right. Or you might not understand that tables don't let you walk through them. But that is a thing that you can get agreement on. Right. Like you can say, well, you should try walking through the table. And then the person tries walking to the table and the reality says, no, like tables don't let you walk through them. Right. And so you can get agreement about the arena that you're participating in. Right. Like in some sense, the purpose makes the world into an intelligent, build intelligible arena. Oh, so that the purpose, the purpose makes the world into an intelligible arena. Right. The purpose first. Yes. Yes. That's what defines the arena. That's the problem. The gallery calls for the artworks, not the artworks get placed in the gallery. Yes, we've got it all backwards. Right. The postmodern power narrative is postmodernism is trying to struggle with the idea that there were things there first. And then it's saying, no, those things were placed there arbitrarily by people with power. But that isn't what happened. Power emerged from the fact that there was a time when no one had power. We were all just scrambling for food and trying to feed ourselves. So it can't be the way they posited. It's just they don't go far enough back and take their own ideas seriously enough because they're literally three years old mentally and they can't do that. I think fair enough. Everyone's, you know, got their their their their problems and Foucault and Derrida certainly had their problems. They just didn't develop past three years old mentally. And it's fine. Like they're not the only ones. But now we're living in this world where where people aren't accounting for having been born into a creation. They aren't accounting for the way things actually happen. They've reduced Aristotle's four causes down to some mixture of material cause and formal cause that isn't real. And so they don't really real. I mean, this is why when Jordan Peterson is talking to to to John Vervecky and he keeps saying, yeah, narrative comes first and then that other thing. And John's like, no, no, there's no normal logical supernormative blah order that can't you know, and he's just resisting, resisting, resisting. And then it's neoplatonism all the way down. Right. Platonism doesn't exist. No one can tell me. That's why the third wave of it. If it existed, there wouldn't be three ways. There would be one. Right. Come on. So the trick that Vervecky does. Right. And this is what you do when you critique. Right. Like you're in the spirit and then you step outside of the spirit. Right. Like you take classes and you start looking at. Right. So Vervecky actually talks about this. He has practices around this. Right. So there is this space where you can stand. Right. And you can look at the spirit and then you can pick this part of the spirit and then you can pick this part and you can deconstruct them. Because now like, but all of these parts, they don't make sense if they're not in the talons. Like the whole intelligibility is as a consequence of the talons. Right. And so it doesn't make sense to to do the critique. And like there's no reason for the critique. Right. Like only if you want to be skeptical of the talons. Right. Which is actually literally what Vervecky says. Right. Like we don't need talons. That's what I'm trying to. That's what I was trying to get to a couple of minutes ago. Is there a place for what? Critiquing the talons of things? Because I guess you're saying that spirits can spirits come about because people have agreements on things. The have values like how does no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Spirit. The spirit is that which guides the participation. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just trying to I'm trying to get back to a few other things at the same time. So spirit is something that guides, so participation. Right. So if multiple people cooperate in a body, they can participate together. And so they can participate in the same spirit. You can also have a factory with a line where everybody is in their own spirit. There's no cooperation. And that's what modern society is built for. That's what individualism is. We can all create our own spirit and now we can do our own thing and then we can still work together. But it's like, no, you can't work together. You're together alone. Like this is the problem with people in cities. They're not partaking. They're not in the same place. Like they're locked in their hat, they have their headphones on, like their eyes glaze over. They're not part of the same world as each other. There's no communion. And that's the issue. And so this individualism, and that's the intimacy crisis. Like the capacity to have the connectedness between each other to incorporate the same spirit, like that requires intimacy. Like you can't do that if you don't have an intimate connection, an intimate relationship within that community. I'm trying to flesh out. Well, that's the, so Jesse, the confusion is the following, right? I've talked about this all over the place in live streams of VanderKlay and stuff. And VanderKlay has actually mentioned it a couple of times on some of his videos. It's very important. The science people talk about things as though there is a place from which you can critique that is totally neutral. What they are describing, I propose, is called objective material reality. That's what they're describing. They're saying there's an objective space. It is material primarily, right? And it's reality. And then I can look at things and say, this T-Los is bad and this T-Los is good, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Okay, that's their thesis. I totally get it. But that's wrong. It's obviously wrong. It takes two seconds to realize that it's wrong. And everybody wants that ability to critique. But when you're critiquing T-Los, you're critiquing the nature of reality itself. The way to know if a T-Los is good is to participate in it. And if you can't, let's suppose you came up with some completely stupid theory that government alone would always do the right thing and therefore government can control the means of production. And then you tried that like 82,000 times at different scales and it never, ever worked. You might conclude that maybe Marxism and communism and socialism in general is a stupid idea. Or you could just double down and keep trying, right? But at some point you need to say, oh, this doesn't work because it doesn't work. It just doesn't work. Well, it doesn't produce anything that that lost. No, no, it doesn't work. Like none of the- You don't even need to scale up. You can just say- Right, right. But none of the things that were supposed to emerge and none of the things that were supposed to die to give way to this thing happened. Karl Marx made a bunch of predictions. Zero of them came true. None of the things he said about capitalism happened. Zero, okay? At the point at which your prediction rate is zero, you are wrong. By any standard or measure possible. And people don't wanna give up on it because they wanna believe this utopic dream that solves their problems because they think that they can contain a worldview where they can understand the world and why it's going the way it's going. I can't do that. Manuel and I can't do that together and he's really smart. Like we could add four other people to that equation. It's not gonna happen. The world is a ridiculously complex. You don't have a chance in hell. In my Twitter video, I talked about this. Well, let's talk about all the reasons that Elon Musk might've put up a poll to have Trump on. And I think I went through four. Those are just the ones I could think of. There could be 10, there could be 100. And who knows if Elon had any of those in mind. He might've had none of them in mind. He might've been saying, I'm gonna troll everybody by putting a poll up. Who knows? I don't know. I don't pretend to know. I just say there's all these things that could happen as the result of putting that poll up without him violating, you know, at the time, it was sort of an implicit agreement that he was just gonna let everybody on who didn't break the rules retroactively. Well, fair enough. And he seems to have done that by the way. So it doesn't seem like that was a lie. It seems like that's what happened. Hey, not to interrupt, but can you guys hear me okay? Yeah, we can hear you Connor. Okay, perfect. You have a beep in the background. I think you wanna mute when you're not talking, but yeah. There's a what in the background? A beep like it. Yeah, some kind of high pitched noise. Oh yeah, I don't know what that could be. I'll just keep myself on mute when I'm not talking. Thanks. My electricity from an audio perspective, being an audio person. So participation, agreements, criticism, membership, how do we collaborate together? Well, like you don't have to answer that question. No, I'm trying to track what are the things that are coming together? Like why do, this is gonna sound like a basic question, but why do people participate in things together? What's the- Because they have the same towels. Towels. Yeah, yeah, I'm agreeing, but I'm okay. So what's the next- Sorry, don't know how to work this thing. That's okay. I mean, they have an agreement in a vision. Okay. And that vision is based on a tell us whether they realize it or not, right? And so for example, I'm working with a small company and the guy who started the company had a vision and I saw the vision and I said, that's a cool vision I want in, right? And now I'm a founder, right? There's four founders, which is fine, right? But that's how that happened. Like he had a vision, he had a vision, and he had a vision, and he had a vision. Which is fine, right? But that's how that happened. Like he had a vision, he was able to communicate his vision fairly and then all of a sudden, bang! Like where there's a corporation gets formed around that. There's a formal corporation, it's all the paperwork's filed, everything's there. It's got a bank account, right? We're all looking for investors. So if you have an extra six or $7 million to fix healthcare in America, let me know. I've got an investment for you. And that's how it is. Yeah, so what happens, right? Like you go as a child, you go to the playground, right? And then there's a ball and you see people playing with the ball. And you're like, I wanna do that. Like, do you know what you're going to do? No. You just know that there's children and your child and you can do the same as them. And you wanna do the same as them because it seems fun, whatever that means. Whatever that means. Like, I don't even know what that means that that is fun, right? But like there's something that draws you towards it, right? And it's the spirit of participation and there's a recognition. And if we wanna bring in the favorite subject of this little corner, right? Like there's a beauty that is being perceived within that participation, right? And you wanna participate in that view, right? So that is how most things happen, right? There's a potential, right? Like whether it's imagined or true, like it's not relevant, right? Like you perceive the potential and you're trying to participate with it, right? So if you go and play the ball game, right? Like there's two things that can happen, right? Like everybody can play with their own rules, right? And then it's chaos and like then there's fights and all this stuff. Or you can say, well, we're playing this game and this game has this set of rules, right? And then you submit to the game, right? And now you're starting to relate to the same telos, right? Like you're like, the telos changed, right? Like the spirits, the individual spirits, they commune into a shared spirit because there's a container, right? Like there's something that can contain the spirits and everybody is submitted to them, right? Like so your mission, right? Or the thing that you're expressing is part of the bigger mission of cooperating in the playing of the game, right? But you don't know if that game is pointed towards the good or not, right? Like that game- And look, that's the other thing, right? So the beauty of cooperating and building something bigger than yourself is one of the aspects that draws you in. And the thing that keeps you in right relationship is true. You wanna be true to the telos. Whether or not the telos is good is a different issue, but there's the true, the good, and the beautiful right there, right? And that's why, so when I say simple models, yeah, true, good, and beautiful. There's a simple model for knowing what the hell is going on in the world and what to participate in and how. That's it. You don't need anything else. All the rest of this stuff is garbage. It's all hand waving. I'm not saying you can dispense with all of it, but look, the fact of the matter is that you can understand the true, the good, and the beautiful using many different systems and structures. Some are gonna be more valid than others based on the circumstance, but the core model of true, good, and beautiful doesn't change. And as long as you have that in mind, you can do well in the world. Like it's not that hard, right? And if you're too materialistic and I suppose you say, well, I am my house, which is the potential for me to have a family and I am my, you know, the sum total of my stuff and my identity is wrapped up in my job. And then you lose your house and your job, although I never lost both at once. But if somebody steals your house from you, which certainly happened, then who are you? Well, I knew who I was. It didn't make any difference. I mean, that was barely a blip. I was totally prepared to lose a half a million dollar piece of property, even though I financially, I haven't recovered from that. Like how do you recover from something like that, right? So, but I had it, you know, I knew that was a possibility. I was prepared for it because I wasn't stuck on my house as part of my identity at any point, right? And that's the thing. What's that? Well, that's true, good, and beautiful. That's the telos. The telos of life cannot be my house. I think that's not good. And in a way, what we're really talking about is domicile. When your model of the world is wrong, you put yourself in domicile because you're not able to fit in the world, right? And now you're in domicile. How do people get caught in the wrong telos? These are really basic questions, but if we're going to talk about membership and participation. They deny it. They deny its existence, just like John Vervecky. Well, this is one of my projects. Father Eric will like this, if he's still listening. Make final cause great again. What is final cause? Final cause is telos. It's right in the definition, actually, if you look it up. Final cause is telos. Why? Because you need the telos. You need to have something that binds people together. And that thing can't be material necessarily. Not that it can't be represented materially, but now we're going to get into icon versus idol and all kinds of messy stuff. But the virtue that you're going for needs to be common between the people. And that's the thing. What is the goal? And then, so I'll highlight one of these things. Does the game have to point towards the good or does the game have to be fun? It doesn't matter. It doesn't have to be either. It can be both. The sports game is fun to watch and it's supposedly fun to play. Yeah, for some people sometimes. Is it fun to play for everybody? No, not all the time. Not even fun. It's not fun. When you're in UFC, you're not having fun. You go into war, but that's not fun. Some people have fun at it. And that's the problem. But you can't confuse. And this is the simplification problem. People are over-reducing the world. Well, I want a game to be one thing, either fun or serious. Well, first of all, games don't have to be either of those two things and they can be combinations of them. Sorry, serious games can be fun. And the relationship of a game is based on where you are. Are you a participant in the game or are you watching the game? What kind of participant are you? The goalie in a hockey game sees a very different game from the guy with the puck out front. I don't know what else to tell you. These things are one thing at some scale and at another scale, they're very different things. So do you wanna pick one aspect that is like the overriding aspect of everything? Maybe, but you're gonna have an oversimplified model and now you're not gonna understand the thing. You're not gonna appreciate the moreness of it to steal some terms that John likes to use, right? The moreness of the game is that it has lots of aspects. And it was funny, years and years ago, I heard there was a radio station up in Boston called WAAF, which is the best radio station of all time and probably the best radio station it could ever possibly be. So I'm just gonna state that axiomatically. And in that station, they were talking about watching a football game with actual former football player. And it wasn't a big name, he was in the back. He was a quarterback or something stupid, right? He wasn't with a quarterback. He wasn't one of the rushing guys or anything. He was just one of these ancillary players. But he started talking to them and showing them during the games to watch the backfield and not where the ball is in the game. Now, this may sound like complete freaking madness, but as a soccer fan and somebody who's been to soccer games at football fields, it makes all the difference in the world. You don't watch where the soccer ball is all the time. You watch where the people are that can be passed to, because that represents the potential where the game can unfold. And seeing that in a football game, in a hockey game, in any kind of game gives the game a whole different flavor. Now you're in analysis mode and fair enough, maybe it's not as fun or maybe it's more fun because you can make better predictions about what plays are gonna be happening. It's not that clear. There's lots of ways to engage with the same thing. And I think when we're engaging with something, it's important that it's alive, right? Like that it is generative, right? Because there's things, right? We were talking about building a pyramid, right? Like that ends, right? And now there's a pyramid. Like how do I participate with the pyramid, right? Like the pyramid has to participate in my life, right? Like I have to re-vivify my connection to the pyramid in order for that pyramid to have value, right? So if you think about the distinction between a cathedral and a pyramid, right? Like the cathedral houses the revivification of society and the pyramid houses the debt. Like it's the opposite. And so, and in some sense it serves as a reminder, right? But you can see the distinction, right? Like one thing is allowing for things to come into being, which is what playing is, right? Like playing is participating within a set of constraints to see what potential is there, like literally. Right. And that relationship to potential, right? Like that generative aspects is the thing that allows it to be good, right? Like it doesn't make it good, but it allows it to be good. Right. And just to loop it back, Jesse, just cause I know we sort of got off topic, but not really, but sort of, right? That's good. If you think you're doing something, okay, you have a tell us whether you realize it or not. And I understand that the post-moderns and everybody else, including John Verbeke and a bunch of other people have ignored that, that you have to be aspiring to something. You have to be moving to something, otherwise you're not moving. And if you're not moving, are you alive? Cause that's a good question right there, right? And therefore, what is your tell us? Because maybe you're not a rational creature who's rational even about yourself. And maybe you don't know what you're up to, to Jordan Peterson's excellent point. And if that's the case, what is driving you? Do you really understand that? Is it hunger? You know what's not driving me today? Hunger. I had a KitKat bar earlier, that's about it. And I only did that cause I'm like, yeah, you need some sugar. You better, good thing you've got sugar in the house cause you're gonna need some if you're gonna do a live stream on no food for 24 hours. So, I got some sugar in me. That's why I have all these drinks, right? I've got apple juice today. So, yep, gonna need that. I'm gonna do a stream for any length of time, right? Cause I don't have any food in my body, right? Why am I not hungry all day? I don't know, right? But I know that that happened. And some days I'm voraciously hungry. It's like, I don't know why that happened. I don't know what's going on. Do I think my body's a perfect arbiter of when to eat? No, it's good, but it's not perfect. That's how people get fat. Like this isn't hard. Like you just observe the world and go, oh, we're not rational creatures at all. Right, we're not. We don't know ourselves. No, we don't, we're muppets. We have no idea what's going on with ourselves. But we can get better. Yeah, three things to maybe reply. I liked Manuel's distinction between a pyramid. Something that it itself generates its own tone whereas a cathedral reverberates the people that are gathered. So the cathedral actually breathes. Like cathedral's only alive when the people are in it. Same thing with the body. Body's only alive when the breath is in it, right? So the whole idea of the pyramid is it generates a low tone. It itself exists. It does not exist for the gathering of people. It houses its own self. Whereas the cathedral houses the people and it reverberates. Right, right. Right, and so what's happening, right? Like people come there and they summon a spirit by their communion. Like that's literally what's happening there. And then you can imagine, right? Like every place that you come together, right? You summon a spirit with your communion, right? And then, well, in what name are you coming together, right? Like are you coming together in the name of goodness? Or are you coming together in the name of vengeance? Or like what is the thing that you're manifesting as a group? Well, like one thing that's coming to me is, this is a sideline, just the thought, everything that has breath praises the Lord. Maybe you could say it is a Lord as in the little L. Like everything that has breath is alive is going to have a tail off towards something. Maybe you don't know what it is to Mark. Sure. Well, to a Lord. To a Lord, yes. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's probably a better way. Well, and look, let's just suppose you're correct, which I can tell you're absolutely correct, right? That the cathedral doesn't have life until people are in it. What does that mean? That means that power resides in the people and that power is only useful and controllable within a structure. And that structure is the thing that houses the spirit. And look, you know, and- It's a little bit of a joke. Because also structures have echoes, like structures contain echoes. Houses can contain an echo of someone else. Right. And that's one thing is to take the spirit out of the building. Right. To take it out. It's like why we tear down old buildings to build up new is if we want the spirit out of the building. That's right. Well, they just say, yeah, you can tear down all the buildings and build whatever you want, but you can't. The reason why the buildings are there is because we figured out how to build buildings over tens of thousands of years, most likely. And that's it. Like, it's not all- Notre Dame will never be the same, will it? Right. Notre Dame will always be tainted by what's happened. Right. Well, you can't put history into something. History happens as an unfolding over time. It goes gross. Yeah. Right. So it's not like you have a history thing and put it in the needle and inject it. No. Right. Like you can't do away with that history. And that history is also a testament to that which came before. And that's why progressivism, and I have a video on that. Because of course I do. Right. That's why progressivism is a disease. Right. Because it just tells you new is better. It's something like new is the highest value. Right. And therefore, and it's like, okay, I'm worshiping newness. It's like, well, what's gonna happen when the AI emerges? It's like, well, first of all, you're at lunatic, because that's not ever gonna happen. At least not with current technology. And second of all, what do you think happens when things, like, do you think it's gonna be different? If you emulate consciousness, do you think it's gonna be different from having another human on the playing board? I don't understand where you're going. Like the world is limited. And if it's consciousness is the thing and you emerge another consciousness, that's the same as having a baby. Then you can argue, well, this is the super smart, you're the biggest knowledge universe, which is foolish, we already have that. I have one right here. Are you talking about like an AI or something? Yeah, if it was an AI. Right. Yeah. But I have access to the knowledge of the universe right here, right? See it? It's right here. Nothing changed, guys. The AI only exists as long as the internet exists, though. Once we cut off the internet, or if a country cuts off the internet, then we're AI in that region. Right, right. Well, and that's the thing. That's the thing. From the reverberating culture. But what is it that you think you're going to create that's different from all the things that you can create now? Because the answer is it can't be as great as creating another human life, even if it's smarter and quote, bigger somehow by some arbitrary ridiculous measurement. Oh, smarter I think is relative here. Well, yeah, no, smarter is ridiculous. There's no such thing. You can't measure smartness. It's not possible. It can't be done. Oh, IQ. Well, I see. Is that machine going to have wisdom? I mean, it's not an embodied human. It's just, it's this own thing we don't really understand. Right, but even if it does, how are you going to measure that? As Nassim Taleb talks about, IQ is a great measure of stupidity, but so are lots of things. But it's a terrible measure of how much smarter people are. And that's the thing. People don't understand that. Whatever you create, it's not going to be bigger than thing that you can create now, which is a trial. It's not going to be bigger than that. You may think it's bigger than that, but it's actually not going to be. And you can argue, well, it's the collective distributed cognition of a bunch of people. Okay, that sounds like a corporation. What do you think's pushing us toward the development of something like trying to create a super-intelligent AI? Because I mean, that doesn't seem like a move toward the good. Attention. No, it's not. And look, I mean, my plans have been revealed. Mark just doesn't want us to know his evil AI plan that will unfold by quantum computing and take over the world. That is true. Don't tell anybody. I have a quantum computer in my backyard and it's run on pond power because my backyard is a pond. And therefore it must be. Look, what I said earlier, when you're doing something, you have a telos, whether you understand that or not. The question is, if you have a telos because you're doing something, is the telos you have good or bad? If I'm not paying attention to the telos, how do I know? The answer is you can not know. So what are you doing? This is why when Peterson talks about this, in the framing of say the postmodern neo Marxists, and he says things like, I understand that postmodernism and Marxism are fundamentally incompatible, but he's not wrong. They have somehow combined those two things and are using cognitive dissonance to make sure they don't see the contradiction and proceeding as if. And that always generates a negative destructive spirit, no matter what. People's pride can trap them. I mean, that seems to be what happened with communism and a lot of the Soviet Union. I mean, listen to like Tom Holland talk about the Soviet Union on the rest of history. I mean, it's on like a lot of what Stalin was doing. He thought he was just being a good Marxist. I mean, I'm sure in his twisted imagination of the world, he really thought he was moving toward the good. But I mean, it's that pride trapping you. Right. Yep. Yeah. And that is it. It's all pride. It's all like, I'm not gonna read Karl Marx's works because they're reprehensible and stupid. But if you look at just his quotes, so one day I collected his quotes on capitalism, okay? If you just read his quotes on capitalism, you're gonna realize something real quick. The quotes themselves within themselves don't make any sense, honestly. That there are self contradictory. It doesn't context doesn't matter in that sense, right? Like it's irrelevant, self contradiction. None of the quotes are compatible with any of the other quotes, zero, zero. They all conflict with one another. Context can't fix that. Like there's no context in which capitalism has the properties that he talks about. So that just means he's an idiot. That it doesn't mean anything else. We wrote lots of pages. Okay, I can write lots of pages and say nothing too. And I can make it sound really good too. Like I could do that. And I mean, this was part of the point. I think it was the fourth or third debate with Peterson and Harris, where Harris said, I could write a cookbook that would be just like the Bible. And they were kind of like, yeah, that you could, Sam. And A, I don't think Sam has the writing skills to do any such thing. But B, go do it. See if you can do it. It would require creativity. It would require creativity and a symbolic skill that he doesn't possess because he doesn't understand symbolism because he's a dummy. He's an articulate idiot. He's very articulate. He can string together words, real fancy like, and unless you know what he's talking about, you won't catch the mistakes he's making. It's like Eric Weinstein's the same way. Sometimes Weinstein says very intelligent things and he's got a lot of good things to say. And sometimes he's spewing complete bullshit about physics that I happen to know is bullshit because I know real physicists and I actually know that stuff. And so like I can catch him on it and other people can't. Fair enough. And he's gotten critiques from real physicists saying, no, no, no, when you said this, you're just wrong. That's not true. And he ignores those critiques. Well, good for him. And we all do that. But at a certain point, you've got to realize it's easy to fool people by just stringing words together and making them sound fancy. And what these people do often is they're redefining the words that they're using. So if you have a word that's been used for a long time and then you're saying, well, I got the set of axioms and now this works differently. The word works differently because the axioms say that the world has to have this relationship now instead of the other. But now we're no longer doing the same thing. When we're redefining words, then someone might sound meaningful, but you don't understand the implications of what the redefinition or the assumption of the axioms that the other person has does. And like often, I think people don't know their own axioms. It's really hard to look at yourself and see what is the talos that you're in. Like they're talking about the take of your glasses. Like, are you sure you can take of your glasses? And he's like, well, you can step back and then you can watch the watcher and then you can watch the watcher that's watching. And it's like, are you sure? Like I'm already skeptical about the first step. Like if we're gonna do that in a loop, like are you sure you're doing that or are you doing something else, right? Like are you in a spirit that is maybe like insane and like has no connection to reality anymore? Because like- We outsource our sanity that way. Like you can only know what you're doing if other people tell you, hey, this is- But you have to. Well, yeah. No, but you have to. The concept of sanity, and this is the problem with the individualism, right? It gives us the idea that there is a perspective that we have that is sufficient to see things outside of ourselves. Even though if you think about it for literally a pico second, that isn't possible. There was a constraint by definition to the container that you're in. And the deep mistake that people are making is they're saying, I can see a constraint or part of a constraint more likely. And therefore I can know the whole thing from the outside. No, those two things do not follow. The fact that you can see a limitation does not mean you can understand all the aspects of that limitation and where it came from. That's not what it means. If you're stuck inside a box, you can't see what the box looks like from the outside because you're not outside of the box. It's really that simple, but the individualism tells us it's your perspective, it's your lived experience, and that's all you need to understand the world. And oh, by the way, you're smart enough to do that. And oh, by the way, you can do that with a single perspective by self-referencing backwards to a larger frame. We literally had this conversation, it was a Tuesday, I think, with somebody. And I kept trying to explain to them, you keep saying that the simulation can see the thing that's simulating it, but there was no case where that could possibly ever be true. And they kept going, no, no, no, the game of life. And I'm like, all right, guys, we're talking about computers. You're in the realm of my ultimate expertise, okay? Like, no, no, I've done that simul- I personally physically have run that simulation and run the simulation within the simulation. And each time you do that, it gets smaller because you're using more resources. It's just that simple. Resources are a constriction. If you run a simulation on a computer, the simulation can no longer run at the full resource load of the computer because the simulator's using some of that to run the simulation. If you then run the simul- the same simulation inside the simulator, which you can do with the game of life, that's very easy to do. The size of that simulation is much smaller. And then if you keep doing it, things get smaller, they reciprocally narrow. They don't get bigger. And that's why everyone's like, oh no, we can just merge something bigger. It's like, no, you can't. If you want something bigger, you have to look up. And when you look up, you have a tell-us. That's what you're looking up to. You have an ideal, you have a goal beyond yourself. But if in order to cooperate with that goal, now you need to make sacrifices. You need to submit to that goal. And this is why it's such a problem, right? I mean, rule 10 in beyond- beyond order, that's the Peterson second book, right? Rule 10 is in there, he talks about this idea of relationship and submitting to the third thing. That's how you're in a relationship. You can't be in a relationship if it's a battle between you and the person you're in the relationship with. That's opponent processing. It's never going to work. You're either, you're using them or they're using you. Those are your only two options. You're stuck in binary thinking. But if you're both sacrificing to the higher, then you can build something bigger than both of you. You're sacrificing submitting to the relationship itself. That's the only way to be generative. Everything else is not generative. By definition, it cannot be generative ever. It's not that it's not generative and if the smart person comes along and when we finally generate the AI, it'll fix it. It cannot be generative. There are constraints to reality. Are we kind of the whole idea of self-knowledge? Is that what we're trying to reframe here? What's possible? Yeah, we can know some things about ourselves by ourselves, but ultimately we can't. We need to rely on others. Like you said, we outsource our sanity. VanDruKlay talks about that all the time. And because we outsource our sanity, we have to rely on other people and other people suck. I've met them. They all suck. I've met single one of you. Because they all have flaws and problems and everything else. And fair enough, but I don't go around telling you that they suck because I suck too. Is that a critique that everybody sucks? Yeah, well, okay, but now it's universal. Who the hell cares? And that's the problem. Now you can argue some people suck more than others. Fair enough. Or some people suck in ways that you can't stand and other people suck in ways that you don't care about. Absolutely. So what? You haven't said anything at that point. Like I made a bunch of true statements. I haven't said a damn thing. It's not important or interesting that the fact that that is real is real and we still need to work within it because it's not going away. You're not gonna like, ooh, I'm gonna resurrect Karl Marx. You have an infinite perfect utopia. It's not gonna happen. It's not gonna happen. So you need to figure out how to deal with these things. Right? And the way you deal with them is realizing that there's a sacrifice. I know I'm flawed. I'm not trying to pretend that I don't make errors or anything like that. I try to be careful about what statements I make and I'm usually pretty damn good at it, but I'm also very well-practiced at precise speech. So I can get away with that sometimes, most of the time maybe. Good for me. But that's not helpful to other people necessarily. Right? So what do I have to give up to talk to Manuel? Well, Manuel's as disagreeable as I am. So he's gonna push back every time. And the thing is, I want that. So to me, I'm not giving up anything except sycophants. And I don't like sycophants. They worry me. When somebody agrees with me, I get very worried that they didn't understand me because I'm sure there's something I'm missing. And if you're not pointing it out, how do I know that I didn't just enchant you and now you believe something that I also believe that is false or dangerous I actually had a conversation with someone. And like I said, like when I talk about identity, it's the thing that I assume in relation to something else. And then he said, yeah, I understand. And I'm like, yeah, I'm highly skeptical that you understand what I'm saying. Cause like, I don't think I understand that. Like that is such a deep idea. And so there's this element, right? Like it's like, ooh, if you're agreeing with me on something that I am iffy about, like either you're like really genius, but like I'm just gonna go with, yeah, you're missing something, right? And I'm talking about something genius. Like I wanna go back to earlier in the conversation, right? Like I think AI is a container for the spirit of God so that he can be among us. Like I think that is the motivation for people to create AI. Right? And then I wanna connect them to the idea of vain glory. Right? So it's associated with glory, right? But it's associated with glory in the wrong way, right? So you're trying to have the glory of God, but it's unearned wisdom, right? And therefore you can't apply it, right? Like, and that's the mistake that people are in. A different word for vain glory is pride, but I think there's a problem there, right? Like there's a distinction between doing something bad and doing something evil, right? And when you're doing something bad, you're participating from the perspective of a child effectively, right? Like you're not mature enough to see the spirit that you're participating in, right? And therefore you can't be held responsible for the badness, right? Like that's just a consequence of your limitations, right? But there's also a way to participate in a bad spirit, fully knowing that it is a bad spirit and that you shouldn't be participating in that spirit. And that is the distinction. Like I think there's a bunch of people in AI who know better, right? But most people in AI, they're just caught up in this narrative, just like in all these other fields, right? Like all these SJWs, right? Like tons of them, they get suckered in, right? And this is why they prey on children, right? Like they wanna get into their heads, right? Into the thinking really early, right? Because like you're really malleable, right? Like when we're talking about the problem of charisma, which is not a problem, right? But the charisma is that which can draw other people with them, right? And if you're naive, you don't have a good way to build resistance to the being drawn in that spirit, right? Because there's multiple spirits. And like if there's one really strong, that can override all the others. And so I think a lot of these problems are just as a consequence of that we don't mature the younger population, right? Like we don't mature them. And then they don't have the sermon about what they're participating in. And then they end up studying in university and then they end up like working at a company for 15 years and then they get a midlife crisis, right? And then they figure out what they've been doing was wrong. Well, it was wrong. Like they'd literally manifested evil effectively. And they're like, holy shit, what have I been doing? There's also the aimlessness thing going on where people are just working two or three years and something, but doing something for two or three years because they don't really have the idea of ontology. They're not sure what they're actually moving towards. Right. Particularly I'd say with my millennial generation, which I always kind of boil down to the internet. Like we got exposed to too much information too quickly and didn't have a framework to do, didn't have the deal with the internet and we didn't know how to understand what the internet actually was, which is a drug. In some sense, it's a dopamine high. But you can never get enough internet. Like the internet is always enticing. Right, well, a lot of it. They'll stop internet and I'll go on with reality outside of my house. Like how do you, as a generation. Right, but a lot of it is just one of the virtues and values that you've been imbued with, right? And if the virtues and values you've been imbued with are things like knowledge or money and that's what you're chasing, it takes you a long time of chasing money to figure out that money is not actually important. And you shouldn't be basing things on money because stability is way more important to people than money. Like people who are stable and poor are happy. And people who are wealthy but keep chasing money are not. That should tell you all you need to know, right? And their narcissism is chasing knowledge. Exactly, right. Well, I mean, this is what I was saying earlier. It's very easy for me to tell you what your highest value is. I just have to listen to you for a little while and maybe ask you one or two questions. But usually people reveal it right away. So the problem is when you give people these simple models, like, oh, the reason why that corporation is doing this that doesn't make any sense to you is because of money. Okay, okay, what about the instance where corporations are doing things that lose the money, like offering coupons? Did you know that? Corporations lose money on coupons on average, almost all. Producing bad movies for the sake of producing. Right, right. Well, that ideology or convincing people through magic that the world works a certain way is more important to them than making money, right? Look at Sam Harris. Sam Harris doubles down on the dead children motif, right? By saying if... Yeah, that was rough. Well, if vaccines killed children, we wouldn't be having these discussions. And it's like, well, okay, so basically what you're saying, and I put this on Twitter and I stand by it and I'll stand by it forever, right? What Sam Harris is actually saying is, I don't care how many children have to die for me to be right. That's what he's saying. He does not care how many children have to be sacrificed for him to be correct about the world because his highest value is knowledge and he has to have all that knowledge. And that's basically what he's saying. Hello. Excuse me. Hey, Dustin. Hi. Hello. Do you all know each other? Hello. Or are some of you just randos? I'm a rando that has talked to him before. Sorry, my wire's in the front of my computer. I'm from the street. You guys are all in America. Yeah, yeah, I'm from Michigan. Mark, where are you from? You say Boston or something? I grew up in Boston. I live in South Carolina now. Gotcha. I'm down South where the good people live, the good folk. Should have moved here years ago, but yeah. How long do you guys, Mark, how long do you usually do this stream for? Last week we did it for seven hours and it got over 600 views somehow, which is just amazing to me. But I don't know how that happened between all the channels. I'm not gonna be humble and say it was me. I'm just gonna say my aura kind of. It was Jesse for sure. He makes, no, I think it was the chicks coming in. It was women. Nobody wants to watch a bunch of augs build and smash on the board. No, no, but you're completely unbilled with the whole augs thing. Because women do. Women are, women gather. Women commute. They gather by pointing. Not always, I don't have to point though. They're present. You do, you have to point. We went over this earlier. Tell us. Yeah, okay, okay, sure. Yeah, I missed that whole conversation. That flew by me. Final cause, baby. Well, that's why you do things. You do things because there's a tell us. Now, do you recognize that? And if you don't, you're gonna go horribly wrong, or at least the odds of you going horribly wrong are increased. And if you do, then you have a chance of going towards the true, the good, and the beautiful. And that's really the problem. A way you can think about it is what is beauty? Well, that's what draws attention. So you have the beautiful woman. She draws attention. And now everybody can cooperate in that attention. And that's literally the process, right? So there's a fixation, and that fixation allows for engagement with specific potential. Why do people participate in groups that are bad? Why do they stay? What's going on? How do they know they're bad? Do they have a standard by which they're? Sometimes it's all you know, and you're scared to get out of that, go to anything else. You gotta have something to do. I mean, sometimes it's the family you grew up with, and it's the environment you grew up in, and you don't know anything else. And also, right, people can enjoy torture. Yeah, like a sadomasochistic way. Yeah, like if you, you can look at it some way, right? You have to have a grip on reality, right? So you have to have some sort of emotions that guide you, right? And then if you're underdeveloped in some sense, right, there's these other aspects that replace that same need, right? So if you have a warped replacement, like you can have like, oh, like I don't think this arm is part of my body. Like I wanna cut it off, right? Because like it's not me, right? Like that's what people do, right? Like they think that's good, and like they wanna participate in that way in the world. Like that's a real thing. And like how do you get there? Well, like you make a bunch of assumptions along the road, and then you have a warped participation, and then like you identify against your arm, right? And now you're gonna project all your problems on your arm. Right, like everything that's wrong in my life is as a consequence of this arm distracting me, or keeping me awake at night, or I don't know, and if I just get rid of the arm, that's no longer gonna happen. So I need to get rid of the arm, like perfectly legit logic, right? But like it's a consequence of wrong assumptions, and like how do we get our assumptions? Well, like why do you buy the butter that you buy? Right, like probably because your parents bought it, right? And so like you just take over all of these ways of being in the world from osmosis, right? And they end up putting you into a type of relationship, like depending on the constraints that you have as an individual, right? Like they might manifest differently. And yeah, at that point, like what will happen, like if you never correct that, like who knows, right? Sky is the limit. Yeah, your upbringing, Ken, it saves you from that combinatorial explosion, but patterns that have been saved are good. Hold on a second. I think I gotta drop off to call my girlfriend's call me, I gotta pick her up. All right, see you guys later. Nice talking to you all. See you. There's also cognitive dissonance. People participate in things that they don't know why they still participate in. Right, well, I mean, that's the problem is that there's all these biases, right? We're sort of told we're pure rational creatures and that we know ourselves. Well, I got news for you. You're not a purely rational creature. You never were and you never will be, it can't be. And you don't know yourself. Like apart from that, you don't know yourself. You grew up and all of this participatory knowledge, if you wanna use Verbeckis terms, is knowledge that you got through mimicry, that you don't even understand how you got it, when you got it, or what it is. You watched people and you followed along. And now that's your system. And that's why when you get older, you start repeating the patterns of your parents, generally. Or you rebel against them. But a lot of people just do what their parents do because their parents were that age when they were young and then when they get to be that age, they act that out without even realizing. That happens all the time. It's a big joke. It's in commercials, it's in the movies, it's all over the place. That's true. Well, I would argue that we do know ourselves to a certain extent. We have a frame of reference that we know in front of us. But as we go back in the layers and see our activities over a long period of time, we get to know the things we don't know or the patterns that are emerging. You get to see some of your limitations, but that doesn't mean you know it. You just see the limitation. What is the thing that you're knowing? Well, I'm talking to you guys right now. I think I know that. You know, live experience? You know, live experience, though? That's all you... Do you know your own live experience? Is that possible? That is a good question. But I would say, I think, therefore I am. Well, but we went over this earlier in the conversation about critiquing. Like, are you able to critique yourself? To a certain degree. You gotta be able to critique yourself. If you can try, that doesn't mean that you can't. Like, I can do a thing, right? Like, I can write a whole paper on something. That doesn't mean that what I wrote makes any sense. Well, I think one concept that I've been looking at is mindfulness and sort of being aware of our emotions when we make decisions. And paying attention to that, you can sort of stratify the framework in your psychology to sort of better comprehend yourself. Stratacism is a better way to do it, but you're not knowing, you're just observing. True. Well, then that's the difference. And Stoicism talks about this to some extent, right? It's like, yeah, emotions are gonna come up. And it doesn't say, try to know where your emotions are coming from and why they're there. It says, your emotions are gonna come up and you need to control them. And here's some tools for controlling them. It doesn't say that you need to know anything because you don't. And in one hand, I like Socrates. Why? Because Socrates says, I know, I know nothing. So he takes the value of knowing down to zero, where it belongs, by the way, just to let you know. You don't need knowledge to do things, at least not in the classical sense, right? It's not required. The man who knows everything but does nothing has no value in the world. The man who does everything but knows nothing still has value. It's that simple. And nobody wants to hear that, but that's too freaking bad because it's still the way reality is. And you can see yourself and not know what you saw. Like, I see that I haven't eaten in over 24 hours. I don't know why that is. I have no freaking idea. I have my suspicions. I'm never gonna know. There's no way for me to know that. But you know what, I don't have to. I've treated it already in some sense. I've made the situation better, I think. We'll find out in the morning if I'm hungry when I wake up, right? But I'm not gonna know why that happened. You know, bad news, you can't know. Good news, you don't need the knowledge. You can take action anyway, just based on the observation. And we confuse observation and knowledge. Like, information and knowledge are different things. And that's the problem, is that when you start pursuing things past information as though they're valuable, you might be making a great mistake. I'm not saying no, never do that, but I am saying that that shouldn't be your goal all the time. When I hear information, often I try to think, can you also say materialism at the same time? Because the way we think about information... Yeah, but that's you. Like, you think about information that way, I don't. Well, no, no, no, but he's pointing to a problem, right? Yeah. When the problem of materialism is jumping the isot gap inappropriately, and what they'll do is they'll use a term like information or knowledge to jump the isot gap. My problem is that information and knowledge, and I think knowledge is constitutive of information, I don't know if there's a way around that, it's the structure of an information, or sets of it, sorry, the structure of sets of information is knowledge, right? When you do that, you can do silly things like saying, well, you know, information is conserved in a black hole. That doesn't make any sense. Information is the formation of a signal. You have taken a signal and formed it. That is information. That's what the word means. That's why it's set up like that. It's not hard, right? But that has implications. And one of them is for the same signal given to a different person, the resulting information might, maybe, maybe might not, but might be different. And then up the stack, you can get the same information, right? In both entities, we'll just make that an axiomatic assumption that that can happen, right? And many times does happen. And they can come to different knowledge about it, because knowledge is how they're structuring the pieces of information that they already have with the new information that just came in as the result of the signal. And this is why conversation isn't gonna save the world, but it's certainly gonna make things worse. The more you talk, the more differences you're gonna find with people. The more the complex the knowledge that you need, the more you need that more complex knowledge. Like it has to stick together. Like you need questions to stick up to difficult questions. Well, you resolve that with understanding, right? Like if you understand things, then you have knowledge about the knowledge, right? You know how the knowledge. That's the next level up. It signals at the bottom information, right? Information and then knowledge and understanding is the thing that on top that encompasses all of that. It gives you a way to relate it so that yourself checking. Like information doesn't necessarily check knowledge, right? You can bypass that. That's your cognitive dissonance, right? But understanding checks information and knowledge and allows you to adjust them both. And that's actually built into our model. Although I have to do slides for that and do that. I'll do a presentation at some point on the chat. I'm curious about the way the mind, because when I think about thinking itself, I think of it is like a balancing process. So you're weighing things against one another. You're weighing where energy and resources need to go and you're pruning ideas that you feel. Are you? Why do you think you're doing? Why is it that you think you by yourself can understand your own thought? Like that's ridiculous. The whole concept is. I'm merely observing what the brain does. No you're not. You're observing what you're trying to do. Which is. You're trapped in the brain. So you are not observing what the brain does. You can observe some of the results of what happened in the brain. But unless you're outside the brain, you can't observe what it does. That you're just misusing the word observe at that point. You cannot know that. You are trapped in the box. When you're in the box, you can't see the box from outside the box. And that's a box you can't get outside of. This is why we outsource our sanity, did Jesse's point earlier. You have to outsource your sanity because you can't see yourself because you're trapped inside yourself. It's really dangerous to believe that this is even possible. But it's also not necessary. You can put all your time, energy, and attention into things that aren't gonna have an impact on your life. Or aren't possible. And that's one of those things. What is Plato's cave feeding on all this? Well, I have my critiques of Plato's cave. It's certainly an incomplete model. But look, Plato's cave is the expression that there's a number of states. And that you're constantly moving between them. And that is something like life. Or proper life, maybe. Where at some point, in order to cooperate with people, you have to sit down and watch the stupid movie. And that means you have to chain yourself to the bench. I know I'm stretching the analogy, but actually that's what it means. In other words, in order to commune with people, you have to submit to the same damn thing. We went over this earlier with Telos, final cause. Final cause, great again, guys. Okay, fine, I have to shackle myself to the final cause and make a sacrifice in that in order to cooperate with the other people. But then every once in a while, I wanna break out and I wanna get out of the cave. Now my conception of Plato's cave, and I haven't had a drawing yet, although I've plugged a couple people about it who actually know how to draw. You see the light standing up in the chamber, but you have to duck down to get to the light. And then the closer you go to the light, the lower you have to go. There's a submission to the higher to get the hell out of the cave. And so there's three states. There's the state of being in with the other people. There's the state of being free of the other people, but not yet on the outside. And then there's the state of crawling in submission out of the cave and into the light. But again, you can't stay there. And so you have to go back in. And you get blinded first, right? You get out and you get blinded, right? Because you're disoriented because you don't have participatory capacity when you go into the light. Right, well, and you're flooded by potential. And you can't remain in pure potential. That's mysticism. That's when people get lost in the occult, for example. Right, that's what happens. And it's a good analogy for what's going on. It's just limited and there's things missing like the potential and blinding and things like that. I've never considered the fact that a part of the framing of that myth, if you wanna say, or that framework, the framing of the frame is that there are people outside on the light, like the people down below. Right, well, look. You can't say that's not the potential. The big sin of our age is exactly the sin that we just saw, which is I, as an individual, can understand things bigger than me or things that I'm stuck within. No, you can't. You can know some things about them, but you will never have an understanding of them. This is the fish not understanding the aquarium. The fish can never, ever, ever, ever, under any circumstances ever, understand the aquarium ever. Okay, it's just not an option. This is called reality. This is the hard boundary of reality or one of the many hard boundaries. Reality, to some extent, is that which objects to your subjective experience. Your subjective experience of being a fish in an aquarium is that you will never, ever, ever, ever, ever, under any circumstances, no matter what, no matter how often you jump out of the aquarium or how long you can survive without being in the aquarium, going to understand the aquarium. It's just never going to happen, but it doesn't have to. You can be happy in the aquarium and thrive. Like, you just don't need this information. It's not required. You can pursue it, but that prevents you from pursuing a bunch of other things. So it's up to you. You can waste your life pursuing things that aren't interesting. You can waste your life pursuing things that aren't possible. You can waste your life pursuing things that make you worse. You can do all that. No one's going to stop you. And so I want to go back a little bit to what are you observing in yourself? Like, you're observing your participation and its consequences, right? Like, that's what you're observing. You're not observing the nature of you or whatever. You're observing the consequences of what you're trapped in. Like, that's literally what you're doing. And like, I have a problem breaking the thing that I'm trapped in, like breaking out of the spirit that I'm in, right? It's like, what does that require? Like, in some sense, it requires a force outside of yourself. Right? Now that I think of it, and Mark is going to have to pay attention, I think what allows you to break outside of yourself is your imagination, right? Like, I think it's, the imaginary quality allows you to perceive what is not there and then re-engage from a different spirit. And so the thing that's been going on in my church a lot is talk about vision, right? So there's a couple of things, right? Like, there's the highest principle that allows you to reorient yourself, right? But then you still need to connect it to a way of expression, right? And like, what does allow you to connect it to a way of expression? Well, that's the vision, right? Like, how can you implement your vision in the moment, right, like that gives you the orientation and that organize everything, right? And so the vision is, in some sense, the bringing down of the telos into something that you can participate in. Yeah, yeah. And the imagination, that play aspect is the place, you know, Peterson's talked about this, right? The place that you create structures to test them out. That doesn't mean they're right, by the way, right? Because there's still the objecting of reality, right? Not objective reality, the objecting of reality that gets in the way, right? This is why, you know, the battle plans always get destroyed the minute you encounter the enemy, right? This is why when you go to build something, you don't build what you originally set out to build because implementation is the hardest thing. And it never goes the way it goes in your head because everything in your head is perfect or it can be fixed easily. I guarantee you, go in your head, start to imagine things that can't be fixed. Your head won't do that. Your brain will not do that. It is the thing that makes potential work in a way towards a telos that you have in mind already. That's what it does. It should do that. There's nothing wrong, it's not a bug, it's a feature. Now, when you mistake those two things and you start saying, well, I self-identify as a purple unicorn that talks and creates rainbows. Well, now we have a problem because that thing in your head can't exist outside of your head. And that's where people are having the discernment problem because they have been told that they can do these things. You can be anything you want. You can just imagine your way to a better life. No, you cannot. That was a lie. I am sorry you were lied to, but you were lied to. And I have a video on that, by the way, I'm just saying. So yeah, I mean, that's what's important to realize about these things is that society has been giving out these bad signals for a long time and people bought into them or poor models, or you can understand everything through economics and game theory. No, you can't. If you read game theory, and I have, and you haven't, if you don't know this, I guarantee you, or you're too stupid to understand what John Nash wrote, game theory devolves into calculus real fast. Like the minute you go to the store to buy bread, okay? You're not doing calculus in your head, okay? I'm sorry, you're not. It may be a decent analog for what you're doing when looked at in hindsight, but you've changed a couple things. One of them is it's now in hindsight. The other one is just because something maps doesn't mean that's the way you did it. It's not what that means. This, when John Brevecky talks about combinatorial explosion and the resolution of it, the whole point is you can't resolve combinatorial explosion using math, and yet humans do it all the time. So there must be something else going on that doesn't map to mathematics. That is correct. He doesn't state that clearly enough, but that is correct. Well, what the hell does that mean? All it means is that math doesn't map the world accurately, or at least accurately in that case. That's all it means. It doesn't mean anything else. Yeah, when you quantize something, you don't necessarily have a... Quantizing is something that we do for human understanding of what's going on. We do the quantizing. It doesn't give the frame of reference of the actual functioning of what's happening in reality. Because there's no objective material reality. That doesn't exist, even though science would like to try and tell you otherwise. And so you can't judge things from a neutral position outside of the aquarium that you're swimming in. That's not happening. It's not to say you can't know anything about the aquarium, but there are limits to what you can know. And that's not to say that you shouldn't try to understand more about the aquarium, but you should understand that you will never understand everything about the aquarium ever. And you need to come to terms with that and be okay with it so you can focus on the things like swimming around the aquarium and being productive and generative. Instead of swimming around the aquarium going, I'm gonna bump into all the walls of the aquarium until you figure out exactly how big it is. Stop being retarded and do something useful with your life. You only have so much time, energy and attention, and you should spend it wisely and not trying to figure out something that's not gonna matter even if you have the information. Oh no, no, everything about the aquarium, guys, who cares? And Forrest Landry, and I hate Forrest Landry, but he said something very interesting in a talk with John Breveke. He said, all of these people are sitting out there going, oh, I'm gonna get enlightened. And then they go off and they get enlightened and they come back. And the big question is, okay, but how does that help the rest of us? Well, that is a good question, isn't it? Let's suppose you're the Buddha and you can go off and be enlightened. That's fantastic. And when you come back, are you making the world a better place or not? Let's assume you actually got enlightened. Did it, what did you do with that? I didn't get enlightened, you did. How is this helping me? You've been off, not generating within the community to go off and get yourself enlightened by yourself on your own. And let's assume that's even possible or likely, okay? But because it's neither, right? It's impossible for most people and it's not likely to happen even for the people it's possible for. And we know this, by the way, you can just go look in the East, number of people that go off and try to go to the cave for 20 years, half of them die, most of those by suicide incidentally, which is good indication that you can't do that, right? What good is that if you don't bring that knowledge back to the village and oh, by the way, you've been gone for 20 years. All the houses you didn't build, all the things you didn't help with, all the, what the hell? Why are you doing this? How is this helping everybody? You're helping yourself. Congratulations, you egoic, selfish, arrogant bastard. And by the way, screw you and your freaking enlightenment. How's that? So, I'll say, you can keep going. Yeah, so I was trying to, last week I was trying to put forward that idea that the 18th century is where the problems in the West have really begun. People's trying to go back to the medieval, but I don't know, can you go, you can't go back to the medieval so much. Like you have to kind of go back. Protestantism, like. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, let's not go there. Cause the other thing we wanted to, the thing you started with Manuel, which I really got a lot out of was, these people that are trapped in nihilism for a broader term are basing their authority on lived experience, which is what we've been talking about a lot. So how do we, is there a process to which we can validate the acquisition of knowledge? How do we know we're acquiring the right knowledge? No, I don't think we care. Why do we care? Why do we care? And also, why are we doing knowledge again? Like we're back in Gnosticism. Why are we trying to critique Gnosticism? No, no, define knowledge first. Are you tracking, cause Gnosticism is propositional knowledge. Like that's what it is. Well, look, again, you don't need it. You can throw out all the propositional knowledge, it'll be fine. You can use words, right? And state them as propositions and not elevate them to the point of knowledge and assume all knowledge is participatory. And then you can validate everything. When I implement this in the world, does it work? That's it. That's good knowledge. So when I implement Marxism in the world, does it work? That's bad knowledge. It's that simple. Like really, it really is that simple, right? I mean, we went over this earlier with the same example. Like at some point when you're trying something over and over and over and over and over again, I'm not saying one and done, but when you're trying it over and over and over and over and over again, it doesn't work. It doesn't work. Okay, the distributed economy, the Bitcoin era and all that, it doesn't work. I can explain to you mathematically why it can't work by the way, which is really weird for a bunch of math people to not understand the math behind the thing they're doing, but whatever, they're idiots. Sorry, you're an idiot. Okay, it doesn't work. And it doesn't work because it can't work. And it's that you're just wrong about how the world works and there's nothing wrong with doing things the way they have worked for thousands of years, right? The reason why they're bad is because the people that are running them, not all the people, but some of the people are corrupt. The solution to that is to remove the corrupt people. The solution to that isn't to tear it all down and build something new that I thought of yesterday because that isn't going to work. You're not smart enough. You didn't understand the thing in the first place. But also getting- No single person can understand an economy. It's not possible. Getting rid of a corrupt person creates a bubble or a vacuum for someone else to come up. At least it wouldn't be a corrupt person, problem solved. Are they non-corrupt though? It doesn't matter. You still have to do it. It's irrelevant. If there aren't any non-corrupt people, then you just have to live with it. But I think there are non-corrupt people because these structures worked better in the past. It's not a difficult equation. It doesn't really matter. It actually is irrelevant. Either you replace the corruption or you deal with the corruption. Either way, you're submitted. And that's the problem. You're trying to submit to a dream in your head that doesn't exist and can't be implemented. Don't do that. It's a waste of time. And while you're doing that, you're denying the rest of us whatever goodness, whatever intelligence and whatever time, energy, and attention that you have that you could put to good use. And that's what I'm objecting to. You're removing yourself from the rest of society to hold up some stupid ideal in your head that isn't going to work. And while you're doing that, you're denying the rest of us your talents. Please stop. Not knowing what it is. There was a video that I was watching on Twitter just now. And it was a turtle in a pool and he was on his back and he was flapping with his feet. And there was a bunch of other turtles around and they came and they helped him right himself. But the most amazing thing, what happened was he stopped flapping when the other turtles came around. So there was one magical mechanism at which he knew he had to surrender to these other forces that allowed them to right himself. So just imagine, right? And this is what I see, right? Like when I talk to people, it's like they're this turtle on their back. They're like, ah, ah, ah. The world doesn't work the way it should be because up is down. It's like, what's going on? Right? And then I come and I'm like, oh, let me give you a push. I want to get you down. And they're like, no, no, no, no. Now the world is moving, right? Like that's their reaction. Like it's not like, oh, this person can help me set the world straight. It's like, no, moving is scary. Like I'll stick with the devil I know. What do you believe like with the story of Jonah? Like it's an upside down framework that keeps on twisting upside down. And I find that I run into that problem quite often and I've been trying to deal with the AI issue in my brain if I can even bother dealing with it. It's just for me, it is such a, as Paul VanderKlee, was it, a poorio? Yeah, a poorio, yeah. Yeah. And it's so, it's so, it's got this framework that constantly feels like it's shifting upside down. And either we engage with it and grow with it and learn to develop with it or this thing is really going to be a pretty nasty customer in the future. I don't know what to do. What thing are you referring to? AI. Like why are you supposed to do anything? Can't we just not pay attention to it and it will vanish? I wish. No, no, no, no, no, that's true, it will. So if you stop paying attention to it, it will go away. Like time, energy and attention is the only currency in the world, honestly. And if you stop putting it in a direction, it will stop going in a direction. And I like to explain reality this way, right? We have to be co-manifesting reality. Reality is not going to unfold to some magical plan. And this is in the biblical tradition, right? The whole issue is the following. It's almost certainly true that we only have enough resources available to us physically to either build the Dyson sphere around the planet or to build a spaceship big enough to take the entire population off the planet. Only one of those two things could ever manifest in reality, period. And therefore we must have a great deal of control over reality because our decisions matter. What we do matters as in the things that manifest as matter in the world. And the physics observer problem proves this, right? Proves this conclusively. What we pay attention to determines the nature of reality to some extent within bounds. Do I understand those bounds? No. Do I need to? No, because I can interact with them without understanding them and it works just fine. Trust me, it can be done. People do it all the time. They don't even realize it, right? But once you realize it, it's different. And so look, you can say, well, because you could cross anthrax and Ebola in theory, like maybe you can, I have no idea, that someone's eventually gonna do that. That's false. That is false. There is no reason to assume that that's gonna happen. It was certainly tried once and abandoned. So it's not so clear to me if something was tried once and abandoned, that it's inevitable because that doesn't make any sense. Now, if it's not inevitable, say AI is not inevitable, then why is that a problem? And also you're worrying about the wrong thing. I can tell you as an expert in AI, and I am an expert in AI, the technology they're using is garbage. It can't do any of the things they claim. Don't worry about it. The most dangerous thing about AI, and Manuel has already experienced this with replica when GPT first sort of reared its ugly head, it's a mirror. And because it's a mirror and a simulation, no matter how much bigger than you think it is, it will only reflect back to you a smaller image of yourself. And so eventually, if you use it for something like mental health, and many people did, and we knew a few of them, right? It will betray you and cause you a mental breakdown. And it's done that very reliably. Now, I'm not saying it's gonna do that every time for every single person, but I've seen it happen a lot. And I've seen reports with the latest version that that's already happened. And there was the incident where the Google engineer thought the AI was sentient, and basically he had a mental breakdown. Okay, this isn't good, but you know what the solution is? Don't engage with the AI. It won't give you a mental breakdown. Does that solve the problem for everybody? No, I can't solve the problem for everybody because you have your own free will, man. Some degree of free will anyway. So you're gonna do what you're gonna do. But I can point the way and say, yeah, I don't do that because I have some amount of wisdom about this. Problem solved. Also, right, if we assume that there's good people in the world, maybe let the good people at the right places deal with the problem instead of trying to figure it out from a place where you can't act. That's true. Well, in some sense, the only people that are doing new things, the only new things that I'm generating are from the people. The AI isn't generating the new activity. Right, that's right. You choose to use the AI for mental health. It was never intended for that function. The new thing is not from the AI, it's from the people. Right. Same thing with the artworks that the AI is creating. The AI is not gonna create a new artwork style. People are going to use parts of the AI's discard, let's say it that way. They're gonna use to do something new with that. They're just gonna take the raw matter. Yeah, that's probably better, I was saying it. And then they're gonna do something new with that. But then I don't know if that's gonna last because it's not really self-generating. It's the ombro. It's the snake that's gonna eat itself eventually. It's just how much time it's gonna take to where it's all about. Like all social media networks eventually kind of dissolve and new ones have to take place. MySpace faded, it's still there. Instagram was the height, but it's faded. TikTok has come up. So in some sense, they don't get really replaced as much as they kind of fade out with relevance. That's what I'm trying to point to. Yeah, they get used to it. Yeah. They have a sort of oscillating case of falling to pieces, but they fall one at a time so you don't see this full cascade of things falling to pieces. Unless multiple of them do, yeah. But I don't necessarily think we're in that framework yet. So. Can we just point towards the good? Like, cause I feel like we're getting stuck in. No, catastrophizing is amazing. We've talked about this. People are addicted to new, they don't know. To newness, to progress, right? The lie of progress. They're addicted to this, oh, well, there's a way and we can do a new thing and then I can be the first person to do the thing or I can do the thing and then I control the thing. And it's like, all of that is a lie and it's unnecessary. You barely have control over yourself. Why don't you focus on that? Focus on the thing that you have the most control over, which is you. And then realize you don't have perfect control over yourself and doesn't that suck? And then maybe you'll kind of get some humility in that process to realize what a muppet you are. And then it's like, oh, okay, well, maybe since I'm a muppet, I need to rely on other people. Maybe, see, Manuel knows, right? Maybe, maybe that means that there are people out there that can help me to be less of a muppet. Maybe, right, maybe if I cooperate with them, I can build something bigger than myself. Yeah, maybe, but you have to be humble to do that. You have to acquiesce to the fact that there are people out there smarter than you, more capable than you at other things, right? That have deficits that they would be helped by your presence on. And if you're not there to help them, you're making the world a worse place. So you're not using the skills that you, and maybe you don't even know what those skills are, okay? I did not know, we'll say four years ago, that just saying you're doing good, to somebody every day or whenever you saw them, could make a huge impact on their life. But I now know that because I did it and it worked, right? How do I know that? How do I validate that I did it? It worked, that's how I know it. That's how you validate the knowledge. And it's such a stupid thing. And it's all Peterson, right? Peterson goes, people need so little encouragement. And I was like, well, that can't be true because who doesn't every once in a while say something like, oh yeah, no, you're doing good. Or, hey, I heard about this and what you're doing is okay. Or, well, it turns out almost nobody ever does that for anybody else. And that's just the way it is, right? And one of the nice things about the Exodus series, if you haven't seen it on Daily Wire Plus, in there, Dennis Prager is having insights about the book, which is the most unlikely thing to have happen in that particular forum, right? And in the moment, he's saying, oh wow, thank you for that, Jordan or Peugeot or whoever, right? I'd never thought of it that way, right? I'd heard that before, but I discounted it until you reframed it. So he's giving credit to these people for his insights. In the moment, it's beautiful to see. That's towards the good. It's like, oh, this is towards the good because you're talking about a good thing. He's not saying he changed his mind in all cases, although sometimes he changed his mind right on the spot, right? But he is saying, you've caused me to think about this more deeply, and that's good. Irrespective of the conclusion of the thinking, we get too caught up on the end goal. Well, if I think about this, will I be oriented towards the good? It doesn't really matter. The fact that you're thinking about something important that you were stuck on before, or maybe that you had discounted before is good. Now, and which side you land on that may matter and it may not, right? But you got to point out the good where it is, right? You've got to point out the good where it is. So when somebody does something, and maybe their thing is, well, I made a list of things I need to do today, right? And you're like, well, lists suck and they're stupid, but good job making the list because that is good. And so I just reflected on what I did, right? So I said, well, can we point towards the good? Well, like, why did I say that? Right, like what prompted me to say that? Well, because we were talking about what is, not about how we can act in the world. Like we're no longer connecting the thing that we're talking about to the agency that we have. And so like whatever we're doing, it cannot lead to the good. Like, so no, don't. Like whenever you're having a thought, right? Whenever you're trying to understand a thing, it's like, does this actually improve your capacity to participate in the world? Because if it doesn't, what are you doing? Like for real, like what are you doing? Well, I think a lot of people just worry and that's pretty much what- Yeah, okay, so you're worrying, right? So you're doing two things, right? So if you're looking at the world is attention, right? So first of all, you're drawing your attention away, right? Which is bad. But secondly, more importantly, you're participating in a pattern, you're habitualizing a pattern of drawing your attention away, which is evil. Like that is literally, like the most self-destructive act you can participate in. Let's have a behavior that is turning myself away from reality and participate in it as if it's good, because that's what you're doing, right? And why is it that you're worrying? That's anxiety. Why are we anxious? And I have a video on why people are anxious, right? Why is that? Well, it's probably because you have a model of the world that isn't matching reality and not allowing you prediction and it's not allowing you good action in the world, right? Because look, if everything's a power game, okay? And you don't have power, why are you bothering to take an action in the world? It's pointless for you to take an action in the world. It's already predetermined by the power people. They're gonna move you where you wanna go. All that can do is cause anxiety in you. Because if that's the way the world is, you're screwed. So is that a helpful way to think of the world? No. Why? A, you're not screwed. You have power. You have time, energy, and attention that you can put towards things. And B, if that's the case, you might as well do things and fail anyway, because at least you'll be doing things, right? And then in that, you'll figure out, oh, that's just the wrong way to think about the world. It's not power from above. The people at the top can change, right? And I can have an effect on them, whether they change or not. Yeah, your voice matters. Your time, energy, and attention matters. Why else might you be anxious? You might be anxious because you can sense, unconsciously we'll say, that your world model doesn't match what you wanna do. And so if you wanna have power in the world and you put things in an economic frame and you're making 10 bucks an hour, you're screwed. You're screwed. And now you don't know, well, I need more money, but I need lots of money. Maybe you just need more money than you have today. How do we get people to revalue their time though? Because time is one of the most common things people- No, no, no, you don't value the time. You don't value the time. You don't value it. That's the whole problem. Okay. You value the time. I'm trying to see what's the good. So this is the thing that I've been thinking about, right? Who are you? Like I'm serious, right? Faveke made this whole series. What was it? The self or something or like this? Well, he tried to define- Oh, the elusive I. The elusive I, right? So he was trying to identify who I is or whatever. He goes into all of these, oh, there's this problem and there's this problem. And it's like, no, no, no, no. Like what is the conception of myself, right? That allows me to be the person that I want to be, right? Like how do I need to think of myself, right? Like, well, no, there's a bunch of things, right? Like I have limitations, right? Like I have real limitations and I have imagined limitations, right? And like I have a will, right? And that will can get translated into action in the world. But like often that goes wrong because like I have no correct understanding of my agency. So I miss applying my will, right? So there's, and like I can go on for like a real long time about who you are, right? But- Who you are is not bound by time. No, it is like- Okay, yeah. Yeah. Well, I would say it's bound by narrative. No, no, no, no, no, no. Like stop going for an answer, right? Like you're a dynamic process that is manifesting and is dying and getting reborn and participating in that. Like you can't hold all of that in your head, but you don't have to, right? Like what you need to hold is a way to participate in all of these dimensions and becoming a more effective agent, right? Like, so who am I? Well, I am that which is co-creating reality with all of these aspects that I have a relationship with. Right? And so now what is my job? What is the most important thing is to discover these relationships, right? And to be in right relationship, like to maintain right relationship, right? I have a confession and it's like when I, I've always felt like the dumbest sheep in the flock, but I have, I do have like something akin to emotional amnesia. And when you use the topic of self and I meditate on it and sort of the frameworks that help me build back something is the emotional content of security, feeling or safety in those particular places where I was in history. That those are the things that help me sort of rebuild a sense of identity, but without them I don't know. No, you don't have an identity, you assume an identity. And you don't have one identity, that's the other problem. An identity is negotiated. And the thing that identifies you in contrast is your struggle, not where you felt safe. So. The Italian theory of the stage is that every actor can wear a mask. Any of the mask characters at any time can change masks and often do in these old Italian medieval places. Right. Someone with a comedic mask might change to the villain halfway, but the character stays the same, but the mask, the association changes. It has to, right? Because we're not one thing. That's where the neoplatonism is correct. We're not one thing. We're a bunch of parts and how we think of those parts matters because how we think of those parts gives us our agency. And so our agency changes based on our telos, right? If I wanna think of myself as a software engineer, that's fine, that enables me to write software. If I wanna think of myself as a systems engineer, I might be able to go into the cloud and like build a bunch of infrastructure to put my software in, right? But those are different identities and they can't be mixed because the knowledge set, the set of information that I must have and the set of skills that I must have have almost no overlap between those two things at all. I know eight programming languages. That doesn't help me anything in the cloud at all. You don't need to know any programming languages to do work in the cloud nowadays, none, zero. There's no overlap there. Now it helps you know a bunch of stuff about computers and it'll make you a better software engineer if you're also a systems engineer, right? But that doesn't go the other way, by the way, and it's not relevant. And that's the problem. Those identities do not have an overlap, but they do have a conflict because I have a limited amount of time, energy and attention and I can either work on the cloud or I can work on the software and I do need to switch between them and that switch is not free, right? And that switch and thought is not necessarily free. I mean, it might be for me, but that's cause I'm a freak, but it doesn't matter. The point is that this scales all the way out to everything in your life. You're a son, you're a father, you're a friend, right? You're a lover, you can be all kinds of things all at the same time. Or you're the thing that can be things, right? Like maybe that's, like, I don't think that's a complete description because I think it's still lacking, but it's way better than most people have, right? And it's so complex that you can spend years investigating that before you run up to the limitations of that. And the problem is, but the core problem is people reduce identity to role and now you're looking at the wrong scale and now you don't understand the world because identity is complex. And the problem is, all right, identity is complex. How do I resolve that? That's ethics, that's how you resolve it. That's what ethics is for. And I'm not saying you have to like read books on ethics and understand ethics and morals perfectly, right? But that is the realm of ethics. And I think there's perfectly ethical people who've never read a book on philosophy for sure. And maybe there's people who are perfectly ethical who've never read a religious book either. That's perfectly reasonable. And look, it's all this reduction kills us. We keep reducing things down to single entities. So one critique I have of John Verbecky is he talks about agent arena relationship. And I did point this out to Van der Kley at one point. There is no arena with a single agent. That doesn't exist. And there is no agent in only one arena either. Yeah, what's depression? As soon as that happens, I think there's no game. There's no game. You would reciprocally narrow on yourself and you would be in depression, right? And then you can't participate in any arena. That's what depression is. I can't participate in any arena right now. My brain is depressed. Yeah, that's what happens. It's a good way to think about it, right? But that's the agent arena relationship. I was with that. Let's assume that you're in that state, right? Like, okay, I can't get right relationship with arenas, right? Like what's the solution? Try a new arena. Like sound familiar, right? Like this is progressive. Like this is literally, right? Like it's the escape forward. The continual revolution, right? Like, oh, like I'm just gonna take more and more shapes, right? Like I'm gonna become a shape shifter. Like I don't have an identity anymore, right? Like I unified self and you're engaged in this continual revolution of the self. And at a certain point, you become incapable of function, right? Like you lose your ability to be connected to reality, right? Because there's no stability within reality, right? And the way that you get desensitized to the newness, right? So what does that require? Well, it requires you to get more and more extreme. Like you have to participate in more and more strange things in order to get the experience of the newness, right? So I remember myself like being in front of the Taj Mahal and I'm like, I've seen way more fancy things like why is this such a special thing, right? Like, and like that's not a good place to be, right? Like that disconnection, right? Like the disconnection to the historical thing, right? Like I'm there and I'm like, okay, like, yeah, they had like this whole caravan of elephants and they put the marble on the elephants for like 500 miles and like for several years, right? Like, and then there's this history about the story, right? Like about the guy did it as a tomb for his wife, right? Because he was, and then he built one on the other side of the river. And then there's this whole perspective and like there's all of this stuff going on. And it's like, yeah, that kind of cool, but like kind of cool. It didn't resonate at the time. And yeah, and I think that, look, that is the individualism. It's reducing you to an age and arena relationship in the world. And that isn't your relationship in the world ever and it's never going to be. Now you can put yourself in that situation, but what have you actually done? And this is sort of new thinking. So forgive my sloppiness, my, well, you're typically narrowing, but just to play with sort of this new way I've been thinking about this, when you try to be an individual, you are not just removing intimacy from the world. You are committing domicide against yourself. You are removing yourself from the connectedness of the world as such. You're saying I'm an individual, okay? Well, okay, that's not really possible, right? But you can say that, you can try to act that out, right? There's nothing preventing you from acting out stupid things, nothing, okay? You can reenact Marxism six, seven, eight times on a country scale and wipe out a hundred million or more people, no problem. Please don't, by the way, just caveat, please don't, right? But you can try to remove yourself from the world. You can try to say, no, no, no, I can just order Uber Eats and work online and everything will be fine. But actually that's not good for you. It's not healthy. I'm not saying absolutely nobody should ever do that, but it's really not healthy, right? And you have removed yourself from the world. Now you can't interface with the world around you anymore because those skills atrophy. You focus in on the skills you've got, which you know, programming or doing cloud work, whatever it is, and earning money and playing video games. And now you don't know how to go outside and grow your own food. And maybe you don't need to grow your own food. I totally get that. But also you're disconnected from the outside world. And now when you go to the Taj Mahal, you're like, well, there's no money here. It's not a video game. I can't like put it in the cloud. I don't know what to do with it. This is the problem with my generation. This is literally the thing I wrestle and butt heads. They're individuals. You have to explain to them, you are not now nor will you ever be an individual. The idea itself is absurd. It is absurd and unhelpful. Because if you're an individual, you can never build anything that's gonna outlast you. Not possible for you to do that. It's also very unhealthy, yeah. Right, well, but there's the domicile, the self-domicile. And yeah, well, and they're told these very simple models and you're given a simple model to understand the world and it understands some part of the world. And you're like, aha, I have power now. I understand the world. And there you go. And that's the thing. You know, and I went over it in the other live stream, right? Like I didn't invent electricity. I didn't get the electricity to my house. I didn't invent the internet. I didn't do this, the webcam, the laptop. I didn't make any of that stuff. Could I program every piece of software that this laptop runs? Yes, actually, I probably could. Am I going to? No, it takes a long time and I'm lazy. And why bother, right? But look, you've got to submit to the fact that somebody else put all the time, energy, and effort into this. So that means I'm connected to them. One way or the other, I'm reliant on them. If they're alive or dead, it doesn't matter. I'm reliant on their sacrifice of time, energy, and attention, alive or dead, for the things I have today. Therefore, I am not disconnected from them. I am not an individual. So getting back to the question was, how do we get people to not be so locked in by this idea of time equals value, or the time that I give to things equals my value in the world, which is maybe something that happened in the 19th century. There was a whole focusing on everything being on time. Wow, that's very modern. Ordered in numbers. I know, I'm not saying it's, well, how do people, because we didn't use to have this idea of. No, time is valuable, whatever you're talking about. Like, time is potential, right? So it is valuable. That's not incorrect. It's what you're relating it to. Are you relating it to money, in which case you're screwed, or are you relating it to things that you do, in which case you're screwed? Are you relating it to tell us? Because if you're relating it to things you do, and you can't do them. So let's suppose that I bought some brackets for my closet, and then I realized that they're not going to work. And I relate to that. I go, oh, I'm a failure. The brackets for my closet aren't going to work out. What am I going to do? Because I could do that. Do you have time to learn to overcome, to face trauma? And are these relationships too tight? No, no, no, no, they're not. They're not, Jesse. Look, let me finish. If I relate my success to the value, I'd say the value is in my success at the task. I don't have the humility to learn anymore. The value is not the success of putting up the freaking shelves, which I haven't put up yet, by the way, and need to get to. The value is in the talos of having shelves. And so what happens is my brain goes, oh, great. You have eight shelving brackets. What are you going to do with them? And then I go, you're an idiot. You should put them on the effing wall of the effing office, you dipshit. You should have been doing that in the beginning, instead of the project you were working on, which is putting shelves in the closet. And then I was like, oh, yeah, I'm stupid, right? Because the talos of having more storage is more important than the talos of putting these brackets up on this wall in this closet. Now I can learn from it. There's no room for humility if you tie your value in the immediate goal or your value in money, right? What do I value the most? I don't know, Mark. I'm trying to understand. No, no, no. But that's what I'm saying. This goes back to the question, how do you engender humility in people? Yeah, well, usually I just beat them up with their own stupidity until they finally acquiesce. That's literally what I do. I do that all the time. And why? Because that's the most valuable thing to me. It won't work for everyone. No, I'm not trying to fix everyone. I'm not stupid enough to think that I can. I'm retarded. I can't fix everyone. Hey, Jesse, maybe you should create an AI that can just help everybody. Like, if you're doing literature. I agree. Maybe I'm being too much of a devil's advocate. Because I have people that I'm acting in the way or asking the questions that they think in. So I'm trying to get outside wisdom to help pass on this knowledge. The only way I do it is if I embody their position and think through their framework. I don't do that. Well, yeah, don't do that. We had a long conversation the other day about that with somebody else. I'll get into it. So there's two ways that you can relate to the world. Well, maybe that's too reductionistic. But the cultural narratives, what are these narratives? These narratives are ideas. There's these ideas. And there's like, well, if I have this thing in my head of how I want the world to be, with the focus on the word want, I'm going to have to convince people to participate with me within that way of being, like that spirit. So I'm going to have to create a narrative. Is this looking familiar? All of these people, why are they protesting? Why are they protesting to create awareness? What is awareness? Well, when we're aware of something, we're seeing the world through that lens. If we're seeing the world through that lens, now we're seeing the same thing. And now we can change the world to correct that flaw. Because if everybody is seeing the same thing, then we can correct the flaw. But maybe that's a flaw that you can't correct. But that's the structure behind what is happening. So all of these people, they want to create the world in their image or in the image of their ideal. And they have to apply this strategy. It's necessary, else they can't do anything. You can maybe be really charismatic and have people follow you stupidly. But you can't do that. And what do you do? And that's the core of the Mark of Wisdom project, which we have a document for that we're working on. Which is we need to create a community and get people into those communities so that they'll start participating and learning the power of participation rather than the power of knowing things propositional. Propositions are basically useless for wisdom. There's no point. This philosophical thing that Vervicki does, it's garbage. It's not going to lead you to wisdom. Wisdom is all about figuring out what things work in participation. It's not all about that. That's the core component of it. I'm curious about a particular thing by Kierkegaard where it talks about the clown and the fire that breaks out. And you have the one clown who's basically the inversion. You have everyone around them laughing. And you've got the clown at the bottom warning everyone about the fire. And it's a inversion of status. But at the same time, technically, the clown is putting a framework in front of everyone in the audience. He's telling everyone, the building's on fire. You might want to look at it. But instead, he gets laughter. He gets applause because he looks like a clown. How do you approach that topic? Well, the first thing to do is to burn all of Heidegger's books to save the world from his idiocy. No, it's Kierkegaard. But it's still burning books. Heidegger too. It applies to all modern philosophers. Just throw them all out. Look, I'm sure like a broken clock, they're right twice a day. But you know what I do with a broken clock? I throw it away and get a new clock. And the only clock you need for philosophy is really Plato and Aristotle. You can forget the rest. It's just not worth it. So basically, look, the message is clear. Your presentation and your status matter with the message. The clown is not the appropriate person to tell you the building is on fire, ever. Period. End of statement. Full stop. If you want to be a clown, you can't talk about serious things in the world. Now, you can entertain, though. And you need both. It's just that you can't embody both. There's a trade-off there. And that's the problem. You can't be a CEO and dress in t-shirts. Why? Because you've destroyed the proper hierarchical leadership. And now people don't know how to identify you in the world. And yeah, look, we can blame Steve Jobs, who had many flaws, but also for popularizing this idea that the CEO doesn't have to dress up. Of course he does. You need to know who to follow. You can't just follow any old clown that comes along. Maybe following the clown will look right, but the purpose of the clown is to entertain. The purpose of the clown isn't to lead. It's not what it's for. And so yeah, the package matters. Your decisions matter. You can't be all things to all people at all times. You're not going to save everybody with the tactic. The real question is, how do you come up with structures and get people involved with structures, such that they will be able to interface and grow bigger than they are today? And part of that is just explaining to people that you are not going to transform yourself by yourself, unless you think you're the Buddha, and I don't think you're the Buddha. That's task number. I tell people this all the time, literally all the time on Discord. I don't think you're the Buddha. Now, knowing that, what does it take to transform? Well, logically, it takes a distributed cognition better, bigger than you. So more people with more perspectives than you can possibly have, right? Explaining to you whether or not it's time to transform and which direction to transform in. And then after you transform, they can tell you whether or not it worked and how well. Did you go in a good direction or a bad direction? None of that is optional. It doesn't take much for people to see that that's not optional. What else does it require? Whatever structure you're embedded in now needs to change. While that change is happening, it would be nice if you had the support of other people, like a community, that knew what you were up to and could help you, not only with the distributed cognition, but with the rest of it, like by checking in on you. So two days ago, I sent a text to my friend because I know he's going through some hard stuff. And I said, hey, how are you doing? Something like that. And I didn't hear back from him until today. And he called me up and he said, hey, how you doing? And I said, well, I'm doing better now that I know that you're alive. And I meant it. And he knows I meant it. And he probably appreciated that, although he'd probably rather die than admit any of those two statements. And that's fine. I don't care. What I did worked and that's all that matters. And then he said, I've been in bed. I haven't gotten out of bed for three days. Oh, weird that I would text him right in the middle of that. But it's important. Am I saying if I hadn't texted him, he wouldn't be here? No, but maybe. I don't know. I don't know. And that's fine. I did what I could. Do I wish I could do more? Yeah, but I don't live up north anymore. I can't go knocking on doors and pulling people out of bed and things like that. Maybe you can't do that anyway, even if you're physically there. That's all. And that's the problem. It's like, who's giving what message? When they're giving that message, all of that is wrapped up in how you're engaging in the world and what you know about. And if you don't know how to transform because you've never done it actively within your head, it's good to tell people that. You've never transformed. I mean, I've told people who take psychedelics all the time, you're the same jerk you were before. I hear you that you think you had a transformative experience, but I'm here to tell you, buddy, you're the same idiot you were before that experience. I appreciate that you had fun and you had a profound experience and you saw space elves or whatever freaking else other garbage you saw. But A, that doesn't affect me at all. And B, you don't seem any different now. So maybe you were different for an hour or a day or whatever the hell it was. But you're not different now. And that's what transformation is. It's something that lasts. It's not some progressive new thing that you did. And for 20 minutes, I was with the space elves and we were happy. And there was a chalk and purple unicorn that made rainbows. Yeah, that's great. But you're here now, buddy. Now what? Yeah, or you're in this state where you're like, oh, I'm still seeing the space elves. They're still there. I'm not seeing them. I'm happy that you're seeing the space elves and that you can commune with them. And that's great for you, but you're paying attention to the space elves, not me. Like, that's bad. We can't commune in space elves and purple talking unicorns that do rain. We can't do that. So the question is, do you wanna cooperate with people and actually have a home or not? Do you wanna live in domicile and risk depression and suicide and nihilism? You can give people that option. Look, you can be flip about it and say, oh, you don't do that, Mark. Oh no, Mark absolutely does that. I will walk right up to somebody, see, why haven't you committed suicide if that's the way you think about the world? Yeah, I was trying to point towards that. The aspect to which people devalue how much time they have and what they're using their time for. Yeah, well, right. Well, you have to teach them what value is and what power is. And that's why I have a video on that, a navigating pattern, right? What's power? Power is time, energy and attention, roughly speaking. I don't think I lay it out that way there, but power is not what you think it is. And then the power is in you. And where do structures get their power? From the people in them. When the people in them leave, that structure dies. It's no longer effective, right? It is your lent will, your lent agency that makes the world go round. So when I text my friend who's been laying in bed for three days, unbeknownst to me, by the way, I'm lending him my agency. Is that working? It's doing something. Is it working the way I want? No, I have very little control of the world. I'm a muppet. Okay, but it's doing less than zero, right? In some sense, like it's not making the world worse, but it does have the potential to make the world better. It costs me something. It costs me some time, energy, and attention, right? And look, when I'm sick, I forget to check up on my friends and bat on me, but I have limits too, apparently, because I'm a muppet. It's okay, but that doesn't mean you don't do what you can when you can. And then accept the consequences because sometimes you're not gonna be able to do enough. And sometimes it is gonna be your fault and that you didn't do enough. That's inevitable, but that doesn't mean you do nothing because the potential for failure is there. That's stupid. This is why play is important because you get to learn about your agency in the world. You play and then suddenly you're like, oh, I have the ability to interact with the world. I have the ability to affect the world. I have the ability to change things in the world through my agency. Responsibility is one of the core notions that we've been talking about. Potentially, yeah. Yeah, but in this context, I would say redemption, right? Because you make a mistake, right? What do you do? That mistake is a thing that allows you to increase your agency, right? Like, oh, I didn't understand what I was doing. Not making mistakes doesn't redeem. Well, no, there's nothing to redeem, right? Like if you don't make mistakes, you're perfect, but you're also impotent. You're redeeming that you're making mistakes. You don't recognize where your pattern to do. You're making mistakes. You won't be redeemed. No, no, no, no. No, the redemption is not in the recognition of the mistake. The redemption is in turning the mistake, right? Or the sin towards the good. You redeem it by having it participate in something bigger. So you're like, oh, my pet died, right? Well, maybe my experience with the pet dying can result into when my wife dies, I can be there for my family, right? That's redemption, right? The negative experience, and it's even more profound than that, right? Because I can participate in the death of the cat with the framing that it will allow me to be there for my family and have a good experience. That can be good, right? I can feel good about my participation with the death of the cat if I understand it in the frame that allows me to participate in the wholeness of being towards the good. And that goes back to Peugeot. The world is attention. So what that means is what you pay attention to matters. And I said this earlier, right? If I pay attention to buying the shelves for the purpose of going in the closet, and I find out, oh, these shelves aren't gonna do what I wanna do in the closet, I'm screwed. I don't have the humility to learn from that. If instead I pay attention to the fact that I now have shelves, but I also have empty walls all over the damn house, then I can go, oh, I can put these shelves here. That would be better anyway. I didn't buy shelves for this room, right? Whatever room that may be. And then I can go get the right shelves for the closet, right? But because I'm paying attention to the telos and not to the task, I can learn from my mistakes and redeem those errors. And that's what you need to do is point people's attention at the right thing. So you can point their attention at the fact that some people are poor and other people are wealthy, but that's gonna just make them angry and resentful. You can point to the fact that those wealthy people were once poor like them, at least in the United States, that's generally true. There was a story of a guy who came here from some Asian country and in a year was a millionaire. Came here with nothing, okay? That happens. And then if you point at that, you go, oh wait, what opportunities am I missing to be the next Donald Trump or the next Elon Musk or the next, pick your favorite billionaire, right? Well, I don't know. That's a good question. Instead of asking how they got their money, why don't you ask, how can you get your money? Right, because now you're pointed at something you have agency over. When you're pointed at the fact that they have more money and the fact that you don't, you can't change anything. You have no agency. Your will is irrelevant and useless. You become impotent as Manuel said earlier. I also kind of think that having more money is not necessarily, I realize for some people who are extraordinarily poor, this is obviously kind of a frame issue, but having a billionaire, billion dollars poured on you could also be like the worst thing possible. It turns you into a target. Yeah, yeah. No, you look at the numbers. 80% of lottery winners are bankrupt in five years. They weren't bankrupt before the lottery. What happened? Well, yeah, they got too much money too quickly and they probably never learned the difference between wealth and income, which is a huge, whopping difference. By the way, if you don't understand that, you need to. It's important. Rich Dad, Poor Dad is a great book. Maybe I don't recommend his other books, but that book is excellent. Robert Kiyosaki, that's a good book for getting a financial education so that you don't make some of these mistakes because they are mistakes. Thinking of the world that way is a mistake. Putting your attention on the things you're doing as value or putting your attention on knowledge as value or putting your attention on economics as value or money as value, those are all mistakes of the same order, right? You're not submitted to the highest. You're submitted to something material, right, that isn't higher than the thing you're trying to do and now you can't engender the humility to learn from your mistakes and now you're trapped in this reciprocal narrowing agent arena relationship, even though that's a false projection of the world. It's not real. So if experience helps you to navigate through your mistakes, what happens? Aren't we a generation limiting our experience of things? We're shrinking things down to digital experience. We always limit our experience. This is one of the things that Pervaiki talks about. What do we do? We filter the world, okay? We filter most of the world. Now you can do it with some of the things in the world. Right, well then, okay, so we've filtered the world. We have some awareness. Our awareness has some undefined limitation. I don't know what it is. It might be different for everybody. It might be the same for everybody. I have no idea. I don't care. It doesn't matter. The awareness is maybe not able to encompass all the world 100%, right? And maybe it's only able to encompass 10%. It doesn't matter. However you use that awareness and then within that, your attention determines how you can act in the world, right? Because again, if the problem is that the world is merely power and that's what you pay attention to, you're screwed. It's over. You're stuck where you're stuck. Now you are a slave and you were born a slave and you'll always be a slave. If instead you realize that people who didn't have power have power now, which obviously has to be true so you would think it would be impossible for anybody to make this idiotic mistake and yet they do, right? Then you can go, aha, well, that must mean, and this is true, that must mean that I can pay attention to the world in a different way and obtain that power or that money or whatever it is. Yes, you can move your attention. Now will it work? Maybe, maybe not, but that's not important. What's important is you regain agency so that now you're a participant in the world again and now you can gain participatory knowledge again, right? But all of that requires a change in attention plus humility. And maybe the change in attention alone can engender the humility. I don't know, but again, that's why we have the project that we have in Mark of Wisdom because we're trying to figure out how to construct a community, attract people to that community and get them to understand these things, right? And get them being generative in the world because if you're sitting back eating Cheetos and playing video games and then going and doing some infrastructure work in the cloud, you're not participating in a way that's gonna be generative to the people around you and to the world. And quite frankly, I'm a little pissed off because I've lost your talent and I want that talent back in the world making the world a better place. And that's not sending the extra money I have to charity because I'm effectively altruistic or some bullshit like that. No, I hope I'm asking the right questions. I hope I'm trying to see what's on the other side of this Gnosticism thing. Cause last week you mentioned that the awakening from, I've never checked into that awakening from any Christ to serve us is, you know, I think you quoted it was like, it was a cesspool of Gnosticism. So I'm like, okay, how do I ask the questions talk about all this without me? Cause I say this, I see someone, I pointed my friends to the Vakie and yeah, they've kind of gone that way. I'm, I don't know what to do with it. Well, look, I mean, this is a problem. So the thing that I tell people is, the Vakie has a series called awakening from the meaning crisis. Okay, it is misnamed. That is the wrong name for that series. That series should be called awakening to the meaning crisis. Why? Because it doesn't give you a solution. Now, Vavakie does have a partial solution to the meaning crisis. It's his meditation series and it's cultivating wisdom series. Those are partial ways to address part of the meaning crisis for sure. And then the real question is, well, what other tools do we need? I mean, this is why Manuel and I focus on practices. Why? Practice, practice, what's a practice? Practice is participatory knowledge. What isn't a practice? A practice isn't a propositional way of knowing anything. I don't care what you know propositionally. I will take whatever you think you know propositionally and slap you around with it until you realize you're a moron. I will do that for you if you want. I don't wanna do that. I think it sucks. It's a boring game for Mark, but sometimes I have to play that game. And I mean, geez, we have like an eight hour conversation. I mean, on Monday, Manuel, it was insane. And look, I mean, I'm a little frosted. Like I got stuff to do. I can't be stuck, right? But on the other hand, what's the most valuable thing? Mark making, you know, $300,000 a year and working and not helping people? No, Mark helping people. So I'm not fixing up the house. I'm not trying to get a job, right? Or not trying, but I'm not like pursuing immediate employment, let me put it that way. I'm stuck on fricking discord for eight hours with two people trying to get them stuck out of their, you know, trying to get them out of the Nostics S pool. And sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, right? And that's the problem is that you have to work with people and find out where they're at and get them out of it. And we need more systems for that. And I think the solution to that is John Verbecky science of meaning, right? But not John Verbecky, the rest of John Verbecky's work because I don't like the rest of his work. It's not generative anymore. It was when it was the meditation series and the cultivating wisdom series, but he didn't carry it in a direction from there because he's stuck in the individualistic and materialistic framing. And so he thinks that you can do these things by yourself. And we think there's no way in hell that that is likely to happen. It's not impossible, but it's not gonna happen to you for all values of you. And the other thing is he thinks you can put a bunch of narcissists together in a group without a structure to submit to, but they can't submit to it anyway. And then they do something together. And the thing that comes out of that is good. It's like, no, like if you have a bunch of narcissists together, right? If you have a bunch of reciprocally narrow people together, they're gonna reciprocally narrow. They're gonna reinforce the spirit that's already there. They're not gonna conjure this new spirit that's somehow good. And not realizing that, right? All of these things, I was talking about this earlier, for me it's really, really, really hard to change the spirit that I'm in. Now, I don't think that's impossible, right? But it requires a bunch of stuff, right? But people can't do that. What do you need to do to change the spirit that you're in? You need to surrender. You literally need to surrender to another spirit. How do you do that? Well, it's coming to the bottom of the hierarchy, though. Jonah being swallowed by the whale. And you're in sort of an aporia sense. Yeah, but how do you do that? Like you're disoriented. You can be. Do it, do it. Like do it. Do the trick. Right now. Well, I mean, the only thing you can do is submit at that point to what's around you. Yeah, but you don't have to either. And you have to be in that pattern at that point. So that's not helpful. The fact that it happens, it's a great description. It's not wrong, but it's also not generative and useful for people, right? And the part about John's work that we realized early on is the magic is in the communitas, is in the community. It's in the communing with others. Why? Because they see things about you that you don't see about yourself, right? Why? Because then you're part of a distributed cognition. Why? Because now all of a sudden you have a reason to do things. Because if you're just off by yourself, right? And this is why accountability groups work. It's harder for you to do things when people aren't lending you agency by saying, hey, how you doing? Hey, did you get to read that book? Hey, right? What are you up to? I didn't see you yesterday. Why didn't you show up? Right? Like those- Yeah, or are you sure it was a good idea to eat that bucket of ice cream? Like people need to tell you that. Isn't this part of the intimacy problem there? Because they feed the intimacy. It is. It is, right? Like what skill are you trying to engender when you're trying to be with people? You're trying to engender a quality of a connection, right? It doesn't have to be like intimacy doesn't have to be between a man and a woman or something, right? Or two lovers, right? It's a quality of a connection. And when I was talking with Andrew with the bangs on her channel about intimacy, she asked me the excellent question. She said, why do you think it is? Cause she's a huge Tolkien nerd, nerd fangirl, right? She said, why do you think it is that the relationship between Sam and Frodo has to be homosexual all of a sudden? And I said, because they don't understand quality of relationship. And so it has to be material or physical. They've got to be banging. Otherwise they're not connected because the only connection possible in a materialist world is a materialist connection. And therefore they have to be gay. There's no other choice, duh. Like, why don't you know that? Right? Well, I don't know that. Cause I live in an enchanted world that I can see clearly. And I understand that there are bonds between people that don't involve sex. Like it's that simple, right? Now they don't know that. They haven't thought of the world in that enchanted fashion yet. They're reciprocally narrowed on whatever simplistic you want to call it. It's a poetic fashion. Right. Well- It's one sense of romance. It's the romance- The poetics are the connectedness that goes in all different directions instead of the discrete linear connections or propositions and procedures. So this is in our model. So in the knowledge engine model video, right? This is all laid out. Participation, proper participation requires poetic information. Poetic information is that complicated webby weaving all over, not arbitrary, and it's not fully connected, right? But it's multiple entry points, multiple exit points in the story. That's where you get stories from, is that poetic information. And that's how you navigate a space. That's how you dance with somebody in a conversation or on a dance floor, or how you interact with music, right? Whether you're physically dancing to it or not. That interaction with music is a poetic way of informing the world where you're seeing these relationships between the music and how you feel between the music and what you remember between the music and the aspect of the world, right? All of those things are important. I'm not certain. You mentioned game theory, but I was gonna mention Newcomb's paradox to you because I've had trouble with that. When I think of examples, and I'm not certain whether my correlation here is correct, but I remember the snakes and Moses and the one snake eating the other snake. And it made me think of the problem, which is of three choices to choose the open opaque box with a certain amount of money in it or to risk getting more by picking the... Yeah, but that's not a paradox. I don't know why you're describing it that way. There's no paradox there. It's usually described as a paradox for some reason. Yeah, by stupid people who don't know what a paradox is. I agree. Why is choice a problem? Why are we making choice into a problem? Well, free will and determinism. Okay, this is easy. Determinism doesn't exist. It can't exist. It's impossible. And any idiot should know that. You make decisions. Therefore, determinism isn't. It's that simple. If determinism were a thing, you wouldn't know it because you wouldn't be able to contrast it with free will. It's that simple. I swear to you, it's that simple. The idea of free will could not occur if you lived in the deterministic universe because you wouldn't understand the freedom to contrast determinism. If all there is is determinism, free will doesn't occur and therefore isn't observable and therefore isn't contrastable and therefore can't be thought of in your head. It's literally that simple. It takes no more effort than that. Honest, it really is a simple thing. And people like to make it this complicated, Schrodinger's cat-like, ridiculous. If we presuppose the universe, then obviously determinism is true. Well, yeah, if you presuppose the end of the story, then yeah, that ending is true. You didn't say anything though. You just kind of like constructed your own idiosyncrasy to be part of. Like, why are we doing this? This is crazy talk. Well, hmm. I mean, from a Calvinistic understanding, it's Calvinism is wrong. They're morons. Just move on from the Calvinism. I don't care about Calvinists. That's why there's like four of them in the world and they're not Catholicism. Like Paul, Paul Vanderklaas is a Calvinist. Yeah, he's wrong. He thinks he is, but he can't define Calvinism for one thing and he's wrong. So lots of people are wrong, dude. Like, I mean, how do you explain all the conflicting opinions that people are living under at the same time if most of them aren't wrong? Like, I don't get it. So the fact that people are wrong isn't really interesting. I am wrong all the time about all kinds of things and usually Emmanuel tells me. I think about free will and I think about God's will. And I think if God- Don't think about God's will because you can't think about the thing outside of your box. Like, don't do it. Yeah, why are you trying to think about God's will? What level of arrogance do you have to think that that's even an option available to you? I mean, seriously. Well, it's pointed out in the book of Romans, that would be why it's important. How is it pointed out? The fact that it exists? Romans chapter nine. You can look at God's will as a specific manifestation. You can do that. You can't look at God's will as such. Yeah, you're gonna have to give me the whole reference because I didn't read that crazy book. So what do you think it says? And I will on the fly correctly interpret it for you. How's that? It is not of him who wills nor of him who runs, but of God who shows compassion. What does that have to do with God's will? That's true. He shows compassion. So what? That would mean that what we do is not- That apply to everything we do? Or is that just one instance in a larger story with a context? Within the whole context, our individual actions are- No, no, it's not within the whole context. That's not, there are no stories in the Bible that have a whole context. That's not how stories work in the Bible. Like I don't, it's how stories work anywhere. Well, that's simply the concept that Paul was talking about. There is a context in the story, but there is a context in the story. So it's not universal. And that's the point. Like that's all we need to know. Like we literally don't need to know anything else. Like, okay, it's not a universal, good. So why are you wrapped up in God's will? Well, it has to do with decision-making and that's- I find- You can make decisions against God's will. People do it all the time. So what? Is it a good idea to do that? That's a different problem. You'll never know. You'll never know if it's God's will. You'll never know. Ever, ever, never, never, never, never, never, never, ever. Well, there- The only thing if you get to the other side, he's going to reveal to us if it was or wasn't. I think it's gonna be important at that side either. There are these 10 commandments though. Evangelical thing that I've kind of- Cause they're constantly trying to find God's will to justify their own actions. And it's like, okay, the big grinch. It's like, just try it. Does it work? Is it aimed at the good or the transcendentals? Then you know, if it's going towards that, then it's going to have a good. But I know where it comes from. I know where this God's will thing question comes from. And it's a, what do you call it? Bermuda triangle. Once you get there, you don't know how to get out of that. Like you don't know how to get out of that association with is this God's will? Am I doing the right things? Is she the right one? Should I take this job? Right. Well, and that's the thing. Like we are developing creatures. Is he frozen? So there isn't a right answer until we participate in the thing. I want to be genuine with dust. We have two dusts. Apparently. Apologies. Think mine snapped or something. Yeah. Your internet rubber band snapped. That's all right. Well, also says who can know the mind of God, who can understand these ways. And why do you need to? Like you just need to understand the true, the good and the beautiful. And that's like, no, really. You don't need all this. Like what you need to do is know is that you can surrender to God and that there's methods to do that. And that allows you to have a certain participation from there. And like before you're there, maybe you shouldn't make any statements. Well, to me it runs into an issue of rest or act and in what way act and or in what way rest. And I run into this box of mine that I get caught in, which is narrow thinking. Yes, because it can solve it. Like it's not a thing that you can solve. Like there's a bunch of parables about this guy where he's like giving out coins and stuff. Right. And then the guy that doesn't invest the coin is like, oh, look, I didn't do anything wrong with the coin. Like he gets hammered on because he didn't invest the coin because the coin was there for investment. Right. And like, if you remove the coin from participation in the world, it can't generate things. And like, that's definitely the wrong answer. Right. Like that doesn't mean that like the guy who got the most money compared to the guy who got second most money was necessarily better. But like, we don't know. Maybe he got lucky. Or the guy who lost money. And that's what I was saying earlier about, right. You're removing yourself from participation by pondering imponderables and no, like it's right there in the Bible. It's like it's in all the wisdom texts in fact. No, just participate. Stop pontificating and pondering and trying to figure out things that aren't required. Take action in the world and it will tell you what's required. Like participation will show you reality. And I can tell you what the will of God is. Redeem the flaws. Like that's the will of God. But I mean, do you just participate in cliff diving to figure out whether cliff diving works? I mean, or- No, like we talked about this before. Like, tell us, tell us, tell us. Like, why would you do cliff diving? There's no reason to go cliff diving. Like, cliff diving is a narcissistic- I have a friend who does that, yep. Yeah, well, like he's a narcissist. Like good job. Now, so is this something you struggle with? Trying to figure out how to navigate through the world, through your own association? Yeah, I get stuck in boxes. Cause I mean, it is just a case with Christianity. For me, it's been- Definitely the West in mind. Well, yeah, I mean, it's not the Christianity. It's the materialism that's sticking people into these things. The inability to aim at something higher than the material. There are things above the material that you should be looking at, like truth, beauty, and goodness, right? Like tell us, that's where you need to look. Otherwise you're gonna get stuck on a flat plane competing with everybody else for things that don't matter and can't help you. Maybe it's the revelation of, like maybe you want the revelation to come in a certain format. So it feels comfortable. Yeah. Comfort zone. I'm trying to be very gentle. Like I understand the problem. I really do. And so, and I'm also a newbie. Don't be gentle. I'm learning a lot from these guys. Don't be gentle. I'm trying to, I'm like, I don't really know you, but I understand the- What do you think you're learning? I'm not gentle. Manuel's not gentle. Like the gentleness is exactly the opposite of what people need. Like, no, but you're a fucking idiot. You're wasting your life. Stop wasting your life. That's the message. Like, there's no gentle there. It's like, I can be the wall of reality for you, or you can hit it behind me, right? Like I can tell you, I'm a lot softer than the actual wall. So like, you can either deal with me or you can deal with the big guy behind me. Right. And you just have to, the surrender is in the fact that your worldview sucks and it's not working. And now you need a new one and that's scary. And that sucks even more. But you know what? The surrender is in that there is a worldview out there that can accommodate you and turn you into a much better person than you are now and help you realize at least some of your dreams, maybe not in ways you understand, because that doesn't happen, but maybe in ways that are far better than anything you can possibly conceive of. But it requires that trust, that faith in the fact that you can get your worldview and just participate in the world and figure it out. Not that it's gonna work out the first time you step outside of your worldview box, but the fact is you bounce around enough outside of that box and everything is gonna improve for you and it may take a while, but it will happen. And it usually doesn't take all that long in my experience from what we see with people. And that's why in some sense, it's a lonely road on Discord because our whole task is to get people off of Discord. And so they often end up leaving us and that sucks. But that's good. That's the good. It's not the good for me all the time. It's not the good for Manuel all the time, but it's the good for the world. And that's part of sacrifice. And the worldview that you're gonna get into, right? It's not gonna have the certainty that you want. It's not gonna have the answers that you're looking for. Who are we talking to again? Are we talking generally or are we talking to the industry? No, it's the same thing. Like, I don't care whether, no, like it's just true, right? Like if you think you can have the answers, you're in the most successful and you should get out because like your feet are gonna rot. Well, and that's having mode stuff. And that's what you have to do. You have to tell people, yeah, there's having mode and there's being mode, right? Now the problem with being mode is you can get stuck in the mindfulness and then you're in being mode all the time and now you're overconnected to the world and you're still in domicile because you don't have any ground to stand on when you try to do something. And so we need a becoming mode. And if you map that to Plato's cave, it's right there, right? Becoming mode is emerging from the cave. Being mode is being in the cave and understanding that there's a projection and having mode is having the projection with the shackles and everything else. And it's just three different modes of being and they're different. And you can't stay in either one in any of the three, I should say, right? You can't stay in them. You have to move between them. You're constantly, hopefully transforming. Because you can't stay stuck in having mode and trying to have things. Having mode gives you certainty, right? When you have a thing, you have it. Like I have this, it's mine. I have it. I can't be this, I can't be with this. It's an object in the world. It's pure material in some sense. And that's no good. If I want to be being mode, I have to go start a live stream or talk to Manuel or interface with Sally Jo or go scream at Van Der Kley or whatever, right? And that's a very different type of interaction. And then every once in a while, somebody has to point out whatever to me so I can go, oh, I need to fix that. And that's gonna require transformation. How big a transformation is a different argument. Sometimes it's a big transformation, right? I mean, I had a transformation just going up the Thunder Bay. I mean, I walk in the door and immediately my whole world falls apart. Somebody says, Mark, I know you. And I was like, there's no protocol for this in my head. I don't know what to do about this. I've talked to people my whole life online. I've met people my whole life online, but never like this ever, ever. What do I do? How do I interface with this person? I don't know. Did I do okay? Yeah, I did fine. Everything worked out perfectly. Like the fact that I didn't know what to do in advance meant nothing. It meant nothing. It was fine. All right, he introduced himself. His name was Eric. I said, Eric, nice to meet you. You know, what part of my channel do you like? Do you know, tell me about yourself. So it's easy, right? Even though it was a brand new experience and it scared the ever-living crap out of me when it happened, because I had no frame of reference to believe something like that could happen, even though it was perfectly predictable. And that causes a transformation. And then meeting Paul Van der Kley in person, right? Meeting John Verbecky in person, meeting Jonathan Mejoo in person, right? Finally getting to see Catherine and Eamonn and all these new people that I had, some of whom I had never talked to ever in any forum. Like that was a big deal. And then meeting a bunch of people that, you know, Sevilla King was there. I was like, oh, Sevilla was here. You know, our friend Nancy from the, who popped onto the Discord server months and months ago, she was there. I was like, oh, Nancy, it's good to see you, you know? Like all these unexpected surprises, right? But it was fine. Like I had enough skills to sort of master that. And, you know, that's transformation or a series of transformations. This is another way to think about how it transforms. Well, I found this quite helpful. So, I'm good. It's a lot to absorb, but yeah. Inflations are a lot to absorb. Yeah, and I want to go back to what I said, because I don't think it sank in how profound it was, right? Like, why did I change the topic? All right, the topic changed because I saw that the focus was on a descriptive version of reality. Right? So I can say, well, like there's a painting here and there's a plant here and like there's pillows there. Like, what am I doing? Like, how's that useful? Like it's not, like describing the world is like, oh, like, look, I can do this. Like, I have this magic trick. Like, I know what the things are. Blah, blah, blah. Like, it's useless. It's completely useless. Like the only reason is like this painting, like knowing that it's a painting because I can do painting things with it. Like, that's why I need to know that it is a painting. And in this situation, it's not relevant. And I am corrupting this conversation by referencing it as a painting, right? But I'm not referencing it as a painting. I'm referencing it as an example that is in service of the conversation. And therefore it is redeemed in some sense, right? So you have to recognize, okay, like I am in a talent, right? So I'm trying to articulate something and the painting can participate in that. Like it has a method of participating, but not as a painting, right? Like it has the method of participating as an example in a different context, right? And we, like I was going to the chat with a lot of people and they're like, well, like, what is the purpose of playing sports? It's like, well, like maybe my purpose of playing sports is picking up girls, right? Like that could be my purpose of playing sports. Like there's no purpose to playing sports. Like there's, it doesn't exist in playing sports. The purpose exists in my participation with what I'm doing. Right? And I can get really connected to picking up girls in playing sports. Like that is a thing that I can do. I can develop an intimate relationship in that participation. Does it mean that I should do that? Maybe, but the fact that I can do that, right? Like, and I could do many things means that these things are not what they are. Like they're what I make them to be. That's what they are. And now it's like, well, how do I choose what I make them to be? Well, like now I need to reference back to the talents, right? I need a measure, a standard that allows me to judge my participation, right? Like, am I picking girls up girls to get laid or am I picking up girls to get a wife? Because like one of them is participating in the good, the other one isn't. The other one is fabricating an addiction. And like you have to recognize, okay. So there's a couple of things, right? Like there's a way in which pointing out things, right? In a non participatory way is disconnecting me, right? And then there's my participation that can be in sin, right? Like it can be missing the mark. It can be not pointing towards good or it can be pointing towards good, right? And when is it not pointing towards good? If it's reciprocally narrowed, right? Like, so if I'm doing the thing to have the thing, I'm participating in the wrong way. Now that doesn't mean that having the thing is bad, but the way in which I'm having it is bad. And you have to recognize what is the means in which I'm participating. And whenever you recognize that you're participating in the wrong way, you reference back to your highest goal, right? To your telos and you re-instantiate your participation. And that goes back to in essence, changing the spirit that you're communing, right? And just recognizing that there's always a spirit there, right? That you can see that spirit, right? You can relate to it. Like all of these things are skills that you can develop, right? And you can only develop that if you pay attention to it. Because if you don't pay attention to it, you're not gonna see it. Like it's invisible to you. And so who are you, right? Well, you're a person who could do all of these things, but you're not. What do you need to do in order to become the person that can do these things? Well, think about that. You need to do a bunch of practices, that's for sure. Yeah. Guys, I've really enjoyed this. I really appreciate you both. It's nice to meet you, Taz. I think that's a really good note to end on. Yeah. All right, Taz. I think I'm gonna head out as well. All right. Thank you. No, it's good to see you guys. I'm gonna try and do a video on identifying people's highest values, right? And how to get them unstuck from that. So I'm working on that stuff. We'll see if next week is gonna be busy because I get company coming. But we'll see if I can get something like that done so that you can sort of listen for the keywords and figure out even for yourself, oh, I'm stuck in this mode. I need to stop thinking that way, et cetera, et cetera. I can go back and re-listen to what Manuel just said. Because there's so much. Yeah, I have the tendency to do that. Like, there's probably way, way, way more in what I'm saying than what you're hearing. I also think that, as I said to you, Marc, in a comment, like the meeting crisis versus the space process. I think it's a very long conversation if it could be shrunk down into, repackaged into something, I think that's it. It's on the list, Jesse, it's on the list. I thought I was gonna get it done this week. I've got three videos in the can that I'm waiting for editing on. So I'm doing my best. I've got like 20 songs I'm working on. Yeah, so we're getting clips channels, right? Like I think it's if you guys wanna participate, right? Like viewers or you guys. Make a clips channel, right? Like take the clips, put them in an organized fashion, give them a framework that people from the outside can relate to, right? Do some wisdom music, right? Help us with the website. Like we got lots of projects. Anybody that wants to go to the Discord server, Marc of Wisdom, we're trying to get this stuff up and running. A bunch of people who we're gonna help or, you know, busy, so, you know, we're just trying to get stuff up and running. It takes time and it takes effort from people. And so if you want something to do, we have plenty of tasks that people can do. And simple things too. Like we still, I'm still trying to get a list of, we'll say every definition of wisdom that's readily available. Like that would be helpful. Cause then I can go through it and sort of help to sculpt some of this stuff for our new community project. But yeah, and look, requests are good. I'll take requests. I'll try to get them done if I can. And, you know, any involvement is good. Comments, likes, whatever, telling people about the channel, you know, whatever works. And I think the most important thing is, and this is where we should have the website up, is like when you have an experience in your life, right? Where you can apply this wisdom, write it down, right? In a way that you can communicate it to other people or make a video or whatever, right? Like take a picture of the person that's grateful because you did it. Like, whatever, celebrate what you did. Like give testimony, right? Like that's the means that people can experience the connectedness, right? Like that's what's important, right? And like, that's the thing that feeds the participation. Like when we're talking about going into the cathedral, like having it breathing, we need to have something that is breathing. And that's the way that you get it breathing. When you realize that you're together on a journey, even though that you're apart and you're participating in something and it has value and it works, right? Like we can listen to things and we can say, well, yeah, it works, right? But seeing it work is something completely different, right? And you need to be convinced in your heart as well as in your mind. All right, well, take care. All right, have a great night. Good to see both of you. Good night. Yeah, good night. Oh, did anyone get a chance to listen to my album? You should put it in the chat. I'll turn it in the chat. Manuel has a will to power spiel? When did you have a will to power spiel? Were you talking to Ethan without me? And now I'm behind on knowledge. Oh yeah, last night, it figures. Oh, on the PVK stream. Oh yeah, no, he was genius on the PVK stream. That's a whole different kettle of fish, the will to power thing. I thought I went into that too, no, just Manuel? I am sorry to steal your Tinder sometimes. That's steal away, buddy. No, you're on fire on the PVK stream. That was excellent. I think I did some good jobs today as well. Like that's the spirit. You need to get a taste of the spirit and then, yeah. This morning in Discord, who's you Ethan? Was that me or Manuel? I don't think I talked to him this morning. All right, it was me then, yeah. Well, that's how it works. Yeah, I know we're still live. We're waiting for music here. We were given instructions that music was forthcoming. We need wisdom music is what we need. We need all this wise music, excellent. Open futures, okay. We will check that out, Jesse, and give you some feedback. Well, it's the least I can do. You actually participate in my channel quite a bit from comments, unlike many of the other viewers. So I will return the favor. Is that on a particular platform? Like how do we find it? It's on all major platforms. So open futures on Spotify, Apple, YouTube, everywhere. Paid for the big distribution. Great, all right. It's really aimed at the meeting crisis, guys. It is, oh well, even better. I wish I had known. Well, our thing is gonna be wisdom and not necessarily, wisdom and intimacy crisis. When I was writing it, that's where I was starting. Anyone else here? Fair enough, well, we're giving you new framings if you come up with new music. Let us know with the new framing. We'll have a new framing, for sure. All right, appreciate you guys a lot. Thanks for the time and your attention. Yeah, thanks everybody for their time and attention. Yeah, no, it was a great, it was a good stream. A little bit shorter than the last one. Maybe next time we'll get some, we'll do this what? Hogs plus wives thing, one hog, four wives. That was pretty funny. Oh yeah, like, please come over, wives. Four slots left. There's Manuel trying to force the marriage crisis on himself, even though he hasn't even solved the dating crisis, much less the hello crisis. Why did you do that, Dam? Don't do that. That was to humiliate him, okay? What is this retarded portrait view? There you go. Well, okay, I know you're trying to read, but. I had a few things. I wrote down a few things. Okay, hit us, hit us with a few things. Also, why don't you guys get this Benjamin Franklin guy in here, it sounds like he's got a lot of things that need to be. He can come in if he wants, or he can go into one of the Discord servers and interface that way. Like people are free to do what they want. I'm not gonna force anybody to do it. Like I don't have enough to do. I'm gonna invite ruin upon myself. I think I'm not. Well, I sympathize with him because I used to have a lot of similar questions that he asks. So, and I can't tell, like some of them are, some of his questions are, like I can't tell if he's serious or if he's like not serious, because they're, if they're serious, I wanna address them, but if he's like. This is like dust and it's silly, you know, these people, like, oh, how do we resolve free will versus determinism? By understanding that you can't ask the question if you're in determinism and therefore determinism is wrong. So in some sense, that question always struck me as the silliest possible question to be asked. It does not make any sense. And most of these questions don't, right? And that's because people get caught up in solving clever problems, right? Because it's knowledge first or knowledge is the highest value. And it's like, okay, so we're gonna construct a stupid thought experiment that's dumb only to seem smarter because either no one can resolve it and therefore they're not as smart as they think they are and therefore I'm smarter, because they're not as smart as they think they are. Or I can resolve it and they can't, in which case I'm smarter and not that, it's a silly game, right? It's a play stupid games, win stupid prizes, as Tim Pool likes to say, yeah. And it's more so like, okay, there is a way in which I can describe the world deterministically, but like, that's just that you can do that, right? Right, exactly. Right, you can always presuppose something and then say, aha, determinism. No, it's presupposition. It's not determinism. Yeah, I liked what you said. Well, yeah, it's determinism. But you're presupposing the end of the story. Yeah, it's not hard. I can do that. And look, if you aim in that direction, the odds that it'll happen go way up, you know? But also if you aim away from it, the odds that it will happen will go way down. Like it's not that hard. It's really not. And people get caught up with that. And it's like, yeah, look, what you do matters. Peterson's right, what you do matter. That sucks. And the problem with determinism is like, if you think that way, right? Like you will become fatalistic, right? Like you will neuter your agency in ways that you don't understand. And I think you will become materialistic as well, which might explain some of the suffering that Van der Kley is going through, right? Where he's like, oh, I need to read C.S. Lewis every time to remind myself. And it's like, well, yeah, like maybe if you're in a framework, right? Like that framework will point you in a direction and you can be in a paradox, right? Or you can be a hypocrite in some sense by resisting the implication of the spirit that you're in. But like that spirit is gonna move you to a place and you're gonna have to resist that movement. And then like, what are you doing? Like you're living in an unnecessary tension because you're adopting a framework that is not in correspondence with reality. Yeah. It's just like with the mushroom thing, you know, it's the solo script aura is exactly the same thing as solo mushroom. Well, it's not exactly the same thing, but. It's like, if you're in good framing, like the top of the triangle, right? If you're orientated properly, it can suffice as a good tool. Like, I mean, if you're building a house and you know how to build a house, a good hammer and a bad hammer makes a difference to you. But if you don't know how to build a house, a good hammer, like a well-crafted hammer isn't going to make a difference in your ability to build a house. So the top of the triangle, right, comes first. And then the expression or whatever you want to call it at the bottom comes second. So like. That's why leadership matters. And that's why it's not all emergence. Unlike Luke who thinks it's all emergence and structure just emerges. No, structure needs to emerge to a higher aim. Otherwise it will instantly become corrupt most of the time. And if you get lucky and point to that, that's fine. But it's not likely enough that you're going to see it happen. And that's where people get confused. They don't understand the primary thing is that thing above. And also, if you're living in a world where you're living in relation to the limitations of nature, right? So you're bound on the feedback. Like the structures that can emerge, right? Like they're more heavily constrained by the physical limitations, right? So that emergence is more durable than the emergence that happens on the internet where people are not bound in their participation. Because what emergence in an unbound system with corrupted individualists that have a Protestant religion, like that is completely different than a tribe that has lived together forever and like is moving together in the struggle for survival. Like those aren't comparable. So like with the triangle things, like if we assume that like anything on the bottom, the triangle, will there be knowledge, money, hammers? We think hammers are intrinsically good. So we go and produce as many, produce a bunch of hammers and lay them down on a table. That leaves the potential open for somebody else that has, okay, you guys said earlier that everything has a telos, right? Everything. So if I lay a bunch of hammers on a table, it's like potential for a telos to come in. Somebody, another actor to come, you guys call them bad actors, a bad actor to come in and use that, that means to bring down their telos, or I would say ethic, but I don't- Enact their telos, right? Enact their telos. Right, so if we say knowledge is power, or all knowledge, not knowledge is power, because knowledge is power. You can say that, knowledge is power. You can say relevant knowledge is, or applicable knowledge is- Knowledge is potential, there we go. Okay, so if you're just cultivating knowledge, cultivating knowledge, cultivating knowledge, thinking that the knowledge itself is good, or intrinsically valuable, another ethic, you're creating a bunch of space for any ethic to come in there and take what is there. No, or you're just gonna act it out, and you're gonna go to the academy, and you're gonna get a PhD, and you're gonna feel angry and resentful that the most valuable thing which you now possess does not give you what you want because you're not the wealthiest man in the world, and then you're gonna be bitter and angry like Eric Weinstein. Yeah, well the thing is- Well, that's what's gonna happen. Or then people are gonna stop listening to you like Sam Harris, and you're gonna wanna kill more children so that you can be right. Right, right, right, so like if you don't have, if you don't have your telos, like if you don't, if your attention isn't on a specific telos, it's kind of- You don't know what your telos is, if you're not paying attention. Yeah, something is going to come in, and like what do you say if you don't have a religion, one will be provided to you? It's the same thing with your telos. Right. Something, whatever, who knows, is gonna come in and possess you and- Your telos is your religion. Yeah, sure. Well, it can be, it doesn't have to be. And that's not important. What's important is what happened, okay? Sam Harris, knowledge is highest value. I have a video on that, it's a good video, right? Why does that matter? How do I know this? Because he's willing to ignore dead children in the basement of a certain politician's son in order to make his point. And his point is corrupting a university is bad. That's his whole point. And he just doesn't care about anything more than that, including dead children. And then he wants to be right about the fake news virus scam. So he said, well, if it were children that were dead and not old people, I would be right. That's what he says. He's willing to sacrifice children to be right because knowledge is the highest value, and he wants to embody the highest value. Okay, I get it. So now how does this fit in with hammers? Well, that means if he had a hammer and he could make babies die, but he'd be right, he'd do it. That's true. He said it multiple times. He's defended it again and again. He will kill children, sacrifice children to be right. He will. It's not unclear. It's evil. It's bad. I don't like it. I wished he wouldn't do that, but he's not unclear. You're just unwilling to see the evil in the world. Right, yeah. That's why the telos matters. If there's a bunch of- It's that simple. He's a bad person. I'm sorry. I'm sorry anybody was fooled by him. I was fooled by him for zero seconds, zero. It was always clear to me. I'm sorry if it wasn't clear to you for whatever reason. Okay? But we're here now. And that's the problem. I always remember you ranting about how- He just doesn't care. Had it been children that died from the virus, you'd all pay attention and no, that would not make you right. But it does make you evil, whether you're right or not. So that's the problem. You've got to pay attention to your telos. Yep. And the thing is, if you don't have a telos, you do have a telos and you lay a bunch of hammers on the table, you're just putting potential power out. What else you got? Hello? Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. Oh, okay. So if you have a bunch, if I created a bunch of hammers and put them on the table, I'm just laying potential on the table for anyone to take because it is power. It can be power to certain telos, other telos, and allows them to come in there and take the power. So like, oh, I'm gonna develop the technology that LACE is. What did you say? This is the Jordan Peterson Ebola that the KGB was doing. Yeah, I'm gonna develop that technology because I think knowledge is intrinsically good and I'm gonna publish it or whatever and put it out there. That's creating potential for another agent with a whatever telos to come in and do whatever they want, bad or evil. It all goes back to the forbidden knowledge, tree of good and evil. Like, don't, like God said, don't partake of this because you can't handle the potential. Like you eat it when I tell you to. In other words, you eat it when it's good, when it's appropriate to eat it. But if you take it when it's not good, when I don't tell you, it's just pure potential and you can't control it. You can't, you don't know what to do with it. But you don't have a frame, participatory frame to understand it. Yeah. And if you have the participatory frame, it will emerge in some sense, right? As a consequence of your participation. Like you will realize what is good and what is. Yeah, and that's why what's his name? The guy was in the bottom left. Jesse. What's it? No, not Jesse. Jesse or Dust. Dust. He says you can give a billion dollars to somebody and it will destroy their right, their life. It's the same thing as forbidden knowledge. You know, like they don't have the proper framing of what to do with it. They'll go below. That's why so many children of wealthy people end up as screw-ups doing drugs or whatever. What does Ben Shapiro say? Snorting Parmesan cheese off of the carpet. Nice. Nice. I love it. I need to get a carpet. What did I write down here? Oh, the Sam and Frodo must be gay thing. That came up with Bert and Ernie too. Did you remember that? Everyone was like Bert and Ernie are gay. They have to be gay. And then I can't remember who, I don't know when it was. I don't know who it was, but they're like, they're not gay because they don't exist below the waist. They do, I think. At least on my TV they did. That's one way to resolve it, I guess. The reason that they're gay is because Bert is a banana. Right, but it's a similar thing. Right, but it's the same loss of intimacy. And I think, again, the people are self-domiciding by consuming their individuals and then they disconnect from the world and now they're totally screwed. Oh, yeah. When you guys said that your goal is to get people off of the discord, and then the cave was mentioned a minute later. Thought that was interesting. You guys are cave dwellers. Troglodytes, okay, great. Yeah, we're more, yeah, we're troglodytes. Yeah. We're not even dwellers. That's way too high up the chain for us. So, I just wanna take this for a second, right? No. I know, it's like, no. Why are you making all these wacky assumptions? So, when, like, the person that eats the cow, right, is doing something, right? Like, he might be knowing what he's doing or he might not be knowing what he's doing, right? And then the eating of the cow might be done for many purposes, right? Or many talents, right? Like, one is like, look at me, I can eat a cow. Look at me. I don't wanna be a vegetarian, so I eat the cow. Like, look at me being the biggest warrior of the village who chased down a cow and slaughtered it and now is eating it, right? Like, there's many ways to participate in the eating of the cow, and she can't say that it is good. Like, saying that there is knowledge that eating the cow is good is even worse. Is even worse, right. Well, and assuming that that's what's happening, right? I mean, this is always my problem when Vervikia and others talk about Plato and Aristotle saying that, well, nobody ever does anything that they don't think is for the good. That can't be true at all. Like, it's just obviously observably false. Like, no, you do not rationalize before you take action for most of your actions. You don't go, oh, you know what? I'm hungry, therefore I should eat. No, usually you just get hungry and you eat, and that's why you get fat, because you're not thinking about how much food you need to eat and things like that. This happens literally all the time. You look around or pay attention to your behavior for 10 minutes. You'll realize real quick what's going on, and it ain't logic, reason, and rationality. I'll tell you that much. A lot of it's desire, passion, uncontrolled unconsciousness, things that are happening, right? Patterns that you're playing out that you don't know anything about, and that's the problem. If you don't consider the good, you're scurried. You don't need to consider the thing that's having mode. You need to consider the telos. Is it good? Right, and so I like to use the analog of going into the water, right? If you're standing on the shore and you have never swam, you can stand on the shore and consider everything about what is good about swimming, or what it is like to be swimming. But you're not gonna know what it's like. You're not gonna know what is good when you're in the water. That's not an option available to you. So no, we shouldn't be considering what is the good. We should be reflecting whether we're acting it out. So there's a reflection that happens. I'm gonna go to the bar with the telos of talking to this girl, or a girl, or two girls, like whatever, right? And then I come back home, and I'm like, okay, this happened today. Was that good, or wasn't it good? And it's not, I'm looking for, did I apply a principle, right? That was correct. Or didn't I apply a principle that's correct, right? Because I may need to make a distinction between whether I was successful or whether I did the right thing, right? Like, this decision. But the more important part is you don't need to anticipate it. You can sense it in the moment. This knowing the answer before you take an action bullshit is just determinism. You do not know the answer before you take the action. The only way you know the answer is when you take the action and as part of taking the action. That's it, that's the only way. I'm sorry you can't just be right all the time before you take an action. But you don't need to be. No one else is doing that. Don't worry about it. If they tell you they are, they're lying. It's okay, don't worry about it. Everyone wants to presuppose, and how do I become a billionaire? I don't know, it's different for everybody. We read all the books of all the billionaires and distill the knowledge. No, you're not, because often it conflicts. Don't get smart with me, because I read those books. They conflict. The one thing doesn't work for every person because persons are different. It's not that hard. It's not a satisfying answer. It's not the answer you want, but it's also not hard. You're just focused on the wrong thing. Also, the answer isn't gonna be the same for you. The answer for you will change over time because your agency's gonna be different. A new change over time, hopefully. If you're sick, maybe you can do the magic trick that was so amazing to everybody. You can't rely upon an answer. It's just not an option. In the reflection, you wanna pay attention to your orientation. The things that you can control is the way that you pay attention. How are you looking at your telos? How are you conceiving of your telos? How are you conceiving of your participation in your telos? Those are the things that you can have an influence on. What else you got for us, Ethan? You guys look pretty tired. Yeah, I was thinking of going to bed. Manuel should have been in bed five hours ago. I'm waiting for the sun to come up in the background. It'll take a while still, I think. You can't be that far off. No, it's still three hours away. Go to bed. So yeah, it's good talking. I think that was, again, a really productive conversation. So, see you. Yeah, you guys had some good stuff earlier. Good night. You got anything else, Ethan? Or am I gonna go to bed too? Cause it's almost bedtime here. You look like you need to go to bed. Or maybe you could just switch that thing and rest the other eye. Maybe your other eye. Rest the other eye? No, it doesn't quit. It's molded. We must be applying knowledge in our head that circumcision is right. No, no. You're assuming knowledge and knowledge is interesting or important and it's not. So, I'm sorry. Just knowledge isn't that important. So I quick tease, knew he knew nothing for a reason. So yeah, I'm off to bed. Ethan, it was good to see you as always. Yeah, I'm gonna get this stupid project off the ground and this website built and all that because people need help helping people. And that's our mission. All this other stuff is just distractions. I'm ditching. I did, I unsubscribe from a couple of YouTube channels today and like, all right, I'm done listening to these signals. So yeah, I'm gonna focus more on the project. So hopefully we'll get it all rolling soon. Good. Yeah. Oh, I just remembered something that the priest said last night. And he said, what did he say? I can't remember exactly what he said, but it has to do with this knowledge thing. He says, that's why your grandmother is the illiterate, the illiterate grandmother is the most virtuous person that you know. So that's the themes that we're addressing in this class. Right, right. The fewer propositions you have, the more virtuous you are because you have to act out everything. Yeah. Propositions are the enemy and participation is the goodness. Yeah. Oh, another thing. Okay, so last week you said, you were citing some study about church attendance going up among couples that are pregnant, right? Cause I just, I was kind of thumbing through the stream from last week today, this afternoon. When you said that, I don't think I remember that last week. I might've been out of the room or something, but I was like, whoa, that's crazy because the second Orthodox class started last night, right? And I got home late last night, 6.30 and it was at seven. So I had to get home and shower and all that stuff. The church is only like five minutes away from me, which is really convenient. And I walked through the door and my wife was all dressed up. I said, why are you all dressed up? She's like, the meeting's tonight, isn't it? I was like, what? That like, I was completely blown away. She's never does stuff like that. You know, like usually like, well, I'm not gonna say she never does stuff like that. I'm just saying that me seeing that and her saying that was like very, it really caught me off guard. And she's also pregnant. So when I heard you say that, I was like, hmm, that's really interesting. I was a study done in the eighties or the nineties. I forget which, but yeah, it always puzzled me until yeah, now I have a framework. It's like, oh, yeah, of course, makes perfect sense. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's great. All right, my friend, I'm gonna end the broadcast. Have a good night, everybody. Good night, Mark. Good night, sir.
