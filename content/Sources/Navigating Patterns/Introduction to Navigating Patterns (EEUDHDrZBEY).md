 Hello there, welcome to Navigating Patterns. I'm your host Mark Lefevre and this is my channel. What I'm trying to do is to help you to navigate the patterns we sense in the world that we see and we use today. Patterns we've used in the past that we're going to use in the future. I want to help you to be able to function better in the world. And the way I'm going to be doing this is by covering topics like sense making, I'm going to be using models, I'm going to be talking about how not to be fooled by things, I'm going to be talking about different terms and definitions versus how we use these terms and definitions in the real world. And issues around figuring out what's actually going on. I want to help you unscramble all of the data coming into your brain to hone in on what's relevant. So please join me on my journey of sense making, wisdom, understanding as I try to grasp what's going on in the world. What patterns are there to be seen, to interact with and how do we use them? How have they been persistent through history? How do they thread through time and what do we do about them? How do we interact with them? Please join me as we figure all this out together. Thank you for your time and attention.
