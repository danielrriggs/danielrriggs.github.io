 Hello everyone, it's October 31st 2016 and tomorrow on November 1st I officially start my Patreon drawing project. For those who don't know, I'm starting a project to draw different carvings from the history of Christian art to explore the language of carved icons in the past. And for everyone who gives $25 to this Patreon project a month, I will be sending you a drawing at the end of the year. And so I would like to thank my first 14 patrons who are just amazing. I'm really excited that you're there and I hope that you'll be able to criticize my work and to participate in the process, to give me ideas. And so I'm very excited to get this started. As you can see, it's a nice cool autumn day today behind me. This is my workshop where I carve and will be making those drawings. I just finished the first drawing I had started, a drawing of St. Mamas from a Georgian repouss√© that I love very much. And for the next drawing I'm going to do, I'm actually going to make one of my favorite images which is an 11th century carved ivory of Christ blessing the Emperor Romanos and Eudokia. And so please stay tuned, share this project to anybody you think would be interested.
