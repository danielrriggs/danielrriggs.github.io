 We've had this interesting moment in history where Tolkien, who is a devout Christian, created a fantasy world, developed a fantasy trope in a way that was based on pre-Christian and pagan and folk elements. So what we're trying to do is push that in a direction that will surprise everyone, bringing in tropes of Christian iconography, not explicitly, but the way the story is told, the way that the layout is done. And so here, of course, we have an image which is basically the image of Constantine and Helen standing together, but that is also joined with a kind of Adam and Eve image with the tree in the center. And so really bringing in different images from the Christian tradition, but bringing them in a way that most people won't know. If someone looks at this, they'll just see it. They won't necessarily understand what we're dragging into it, but that's what we're bringing into the image. A Christian dream world. That is exactly what we're going for. you
