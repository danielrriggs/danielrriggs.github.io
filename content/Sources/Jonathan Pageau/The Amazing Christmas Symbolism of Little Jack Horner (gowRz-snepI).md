 So hello everybody it is coming very close to Christmas in a few days I was really hoping to put out my Video analysis about gremlins a little bit earlier. It seems like it might be coming out on the 24th of December Which is actually quite horrible. I'll try to get it out on the 23rd, but it seems like it might be coming out on the 24th so Just to kind of compensate because I feel bad about that I thought I'd add one more video this month and I thought I would do it on an interpretation of a Mother Goose rhyme little Jack Horner. I haven't explored mother goose Rhymes until now. I thought it would be an opportunity not only to look into the wealth that nursery rhymes offer us But also another a little more one more step in understanding on how symbolism lays itself out This is Jonathan Peugeot welcome to the symbolic world You So As I've said before in other videos What's important to understand when we look at this nursery rhyme is to look at the structure if you go online? If you go on the Wikipedia page, and you try to understand the meaning of this nursery rhyme You will find that the nursery rhyme is a very interesting one It's a very interesting one because it's a very interesting one because it's a very interesting one If you go on the Wikipedia page and you try to understand the meaning of this nursery rhyme you will find all kinds of theories about some historical grounding in the Middle Ages or in you know later history and how it appeared in the 18th century as Social commentary on this or that event and you would you'll find is that it's not clear exactly where it comes from and To be to be honest My point is that it's not that important What's important is that out of the thousands of nursery rhymes or songs that came about in those times? this song was kept and this song was selected and The reason why it was kept and selected is because it taps into something which is deeper the structure of the nursery rhyme taps into a deeper reality and In fact it can help us to understand some of the symbolism which surrounds Christmas and I've done a few videos on Christmas recently focusing on let's call it You know the positive aspects of Christianity, but this particular the positive aspects of Christmas this particular nursery rhyme actually shows us a Flipside of the symbolism of Christmas the negative aspect of the whole symbolic structure around which Christmas Organizes itself related of course to the solstice now first of all let's look at the element so you have this little Jack Horner Who goes and sits in a corner? And he's eating his Christmas pie So he puts in his thumb pulls out of plum, and he says what a good boy am I so this this nursery rhyme is Amazing it it it functions on so many levels it's going to be very difficult for me to fully unravel all the all the Beautiful symbolism that is in this nursery rhyme, so let's kind of start and we'll go at it line by line Hopefully we can get to to I can get to show you the the mystery now first of all Jack Horner There are two things in that name little Jack Horner, so The first is the jack part the jack part is It's complicated jack is a figure which appears in many Nursery rhymes many stories and the jack has to do with Jacob it relates to the notion of Jacob it has to do with this idea of It has to do with this idea of how the just can somehow be a trickster and how this I talked about you know this notion of the trickster as Flipping things upside down, but that at the end of Something the trickster can also flip things back on their feet and so jack Has to has to do with this idea you see it in the story of jack and the beanstalk where he You know he's he's a thief, but his thievery You know is able to restart his family's story by stealing from the from the Giants He goes into this world of dark Giants And he's able to steal from them and by doing that he restarts the cycle of his family Which was poor in which it didn't have anything now this nursery rhyme has the same structure And so we'll go through it. We'll get to it now little Jack Horner So the jack first of all the jack has to do with this notion of the trickster which goes who goes to The edge and is able to flip things around then Horner The notion of Horner you have to see it as rhyming with corner of course I've told you about in other videos about the relationship between certain Word symbolism I haven't gone a lot into word symbolism because it's it's difficult to talk about Just in a video and it also can seem very Very obscure to people, but there are relationships of words Etymological relationship, but also sonar you know sound relationships which you Meaning can appear in the relationships of sounds between different words so Horner and corner Horn has Horner has to do with horn and so this idea of a horn now horn corn crown all these words are Related to each other in terms of their meaning The notion of a a crown on a on a on the head of a king is related to the word horn The I've talked about this in the notion that in Hebrew for example There's a word which in which the word for glory and the word for Crown The word for horn they're all the same it all it leads it led to a confusion or a Let's say a very mysterious interpretation in the Western Church where when Moses comes down from the mountain and it says you know and he He it says that he had glory that he was shining and people couldn't look at him you could also interpret it as he had horns on his head and so he and and and so you could see medieval representation of Moses with these horns on his head and so You can see it the idea of a horn the idea of a corner the idea of a crown with all these points all of this is Related to the same symbolism that is this idea of moving into an extreme Going into the point of something the the place where this comes together But also the place where something ends, okay, and so the solstice both solstices can be seen as these horns as These corners where the Sun is going down down down down down and then starts to go back up Or the Sun is going up up up up up and then starts to go back down and so there's a relationship between this whole idea of The solstice as this darkest time this idea of the horn as this point which which comes together And also just this notion of the extreme as well the idea of the extreme and this This all the symbolism of the extreme is extremely it's very difficult to understand It's quite. Yeah, it's quite intense Let's say that it's not easy to to get to so anyways Let's get back to our little friend Jack Horner So Jack Horner sits in a corner and he eats his Christmas pie now the traditional understanding of this fairy of this nursery rhyme is that it has to do with a form of a Apportionism a form of Someone who profits from a situation in kind of a bad way and so it's been related to in politics for Politics for example where something bad is happening a war or a bad situation and out of that Someone is able to put their thumb in and pull out a plum And so for there are several political cartoons which show for example Abraham Lincoln who who you know through the this whole situation of the Civil War and the situation of the South He has this plum which is which is Louisiana And he pulls out this plum as this thing that he can pull out of the dark south as his precious thing that he can rely on okay, and so you can see it also in terms of any type of political situation where a Bad thing is happening, and then somebody is able to profit from it And so Jack Horner goes into his corner, and he's got his pie all for himself He's got this pie. He's hiding in the corner. You know he's not he's not sharing it He's hiding in this corner, and then he puts in his thumb, and he pulls out a plump now There's a lot of there are a lot of things going on in that symbolism So this notion of entering into the corner entering into the extreme entering also into the Hidden place you know I've told you about this hidden place or this dark place In in several of my of my videos and then in this dark place He's holding this pie and the pie you have to understand the pie as The bottom of the hierarchy the pie as this food as this potentiality But also the way the pie is made you know it's hiding its contents And so it's like a it's like a gift wrapped in in in paper under the tree in you know under this Under this corner you have this this wrapped gift which is hidden and so So Jack Horner plunges his thumb in and he pulls out a plumb now the plum is the same as this spark It's the same as the golden ball that the frog goes to get down to the water I've been telling you about this symbolism forever, so Jack puts his thumb into this unknown place He like he's fishing. You know he's putting his his he's putting his Fishing rod he's throwing his his fishing rod out into the dark waters then he goes in and he pulls out a precious thing a plum a seed a you know a pearl Whatever how you want to imagine it. That's the imagery that's used okay, and then finally he says what a good boy am I now? You can see how that what a good boy am I? Cuts in with the whole idea of Christmas where you know this notion that if you're good you will get a gift But now you see that it follows the very same structure this notion of this hidden gift He goes into the corner into the solstice into this dark place to the darkest place And then he's able to go in and find a precious thing out of this dark place Okay, so it's the same symbolism as Christmas that as Christ hiding under this hiding under this mountain Hiding in a cave the darkest place Think of that think of a cave as a corner that goes down and think of a mountain as a corner that goes up And so Christ goes down into this corner that goes down and and there appears the hidden Christ in that in that hidden place okay So this structure is the same and you can see the same for the the political Apportionism that I talked about the structure is the same but what what's important and what what is helpful in? Thinking about the little Jack Horner story is that it shows us how Symbolism is structural. It's not Moral directly it does refer sometimes to moral things, but the symbolism is structural and each structure in terms of symbolism also has a dark inversion and so in fact You can imagine that the the this story of little Jack Horner although it follows the same structure as The Christmas story it is a upside down version of the Christmas story. It's a it's a dark version of the Christmas story that is You can see it first of all in the notion that he pulls out the plum and then he says What a good boy am I and so in that gesture of saying what a good boy am I you can see the difference Between for example the notion of being judged by Santa Claus as to whether or not you're good If you can see it as Adam as Eve reaching out to take the fruit for herself and saying What a good boy am I what a good girl am I I am the I am? Independent I am my own judge I am my own author and so here I am going to reach out and take this this fruit from the tree So so Jack Horner plunges down into the pie and he takes the fruit for himself In a way that is it's a negative way. It's not it's not It is not it doesn't it shows us the negative aspect of that symbolism Okay, and so you can imagine and that's why it refers to profiteering That's why it refers to to although following the same structure going into a dark place going into a place where things are Chaotic things are falling apart. There's war there's conflict There's all these problems and then finding the the golden thing in the darkness and pulling it out right not in in the notion of Wanting then to restart the world this idea of going down into the darkness and finding meaning but rather to do it in a in a way that is is Profiteering and is there to just bolster my own interest in a selfish and and fallen manner you could say and so I've given you guys already a lot to chew on I didn't want to make this video too long I just wanted to to do a little thing and because the gremlins video might be coming out before Christmas and if not, it might be coming out on Christmas Eve Which is kind of sad to think that I'll be talking about gremlins for you guys on Christmas Eve So I wanted to to give you a little bit of something to in the meantime Guys check out the the I put out the December Q&A once again last month The Q&A this month I did again because in the Q&A for December I am discussing the whole question of patreon the The whole story of what has been happening on patreon and kind of my stance on it and the steps that I'm taking To move further on that line. So check that out and as usual, you know, thanks everybody for your support it's been an amazing year and Merry Christmas if you if you don't get my my gremlins Merry Christmas, and I will see all of you very soon Obviously Santa Claus exists Obviously Santa Claus exists Obviously Santa Claus exists
