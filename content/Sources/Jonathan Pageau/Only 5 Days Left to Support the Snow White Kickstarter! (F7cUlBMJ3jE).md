 Once upon a time, the queen of a certain kingdom was barren. Though she wished it more than anything, she could not have a child. She kept her sadness hidden in songs and kindness, but the king could discern her suffering through the smiles. For years she kept her tears to herself, her heart secretly praying for her long-desired child. One day on the feast of Candlemas, a crow perched in a tree just above her in the garden. Startled in her mending, the queen pricked her finger and a drop of her blood fell onto the pristine snow. She knew at that moment that she would have a child, that her prayers had been answered. She would give birth to the most beautiful girl in the world, with skin as white as the virgin snow, with lips as red as blood, and with hair as black as coal.
