 Because you know I publish an article on the American conservative on the symbolism of little nazx and one division and also just basically understanding the satanic trope and the witchcraft trope that we find in our culture. In the original video that I had recorded that was deleted I had also talked about the upside down pentagram but in writing up the article and hopefully it will actually be recorded and put out as a video soon it's being edited right now in doing the video form I just in doing the article form I just couldn't find room for the upside down pentagram stuff and so I thought that maybe I could use this as a patron only video very strange thing I guess to explain especially as Lent carries on but nonetheless I will just give you a slight a basic idea of why the upside down pentagram is used as a satanic symbol and this might also be kind of a counterbalance to the other video I did where I tried to debunk the notion that geometric shapes have inherent meaning in the sense of inherent moral meaning and this maybe will be a way for people to understand that yes I do believe that certain images are used in terms of satanic imagery or occult imagery and that these are done coherently that it's not arbitrary why certain images are used so get ready so we're going to talk about the upside down pentagram this is Jonathan Pajot welcome to the symbolic world so in order to understand the upside down pentagram we must at first understand the pentagram a pentagram is we call it a star I mean the fact that we think that this is a star is uh let's say it's a very abstract vision of what you actually see in the heavens the fact that we have these points instead of a pentagon for example which also has five points has to do with the idea of a let's say coming into to a very precise manifestation so something that goes into a point right it's like all this potential kind of like a mountain you could say so you can imagine kind of like a mountain this point that goes into a condensation or a concentration of something that is what these shapes that have points can help can mean and so when you have many of them they mean many points obviously that sounds obvious but um and so in terms of a uh a pentagram the idea is because of the way the pentagram appears when you see it you know the right side up version it it's a looks like a triangle a mountain let's say and it then it has four points on the side going sideways and then down and uh so you can understand it as the idea of a top point which is on top or let's say above the four points you can understand it as the top let's say wielding authority over the bottom so the origin of the upside down pentagram obviously comes from the from magic it comes from uh let's say this magical tradition that was installed in the west um starting in the late middle ages and in the early renaissance and so both the right side of pentagram and the upside down pentagram will be seen based in kind of occult practices so you know you have this image of course of the of the the pentagram with the person standing in the middle and doing some kind of weird ritual it doesn't mean that obviously both sides can be used for strange purposes but it the the pentagram and the cross itself too like you you know in magical theory they'll also use crosses in different images that are actually christian um and so it doesn't mean that the the geometric figure doesn't have a certain amount of meaning in it especially if you understand it in terms of how it presents itself to you and so you have to understand the pentagram as this point this mountain with four points on the side going sideways and going down that's why it is often represented as a man with the head above and then the arms going out to the sides and the legs coming down so you could imagine it as the source of action and then the embodiment of action you can understand it as a building like a pyramid itself that has four corners on the on the side and then moves up into a point and you can understand it in many ways in which the four which is really an image of multiplicity itself is united into the one so it could be the four elements that are united into the spiritual element in ether or you know this this idea of a of spirit that unites the four elements together there are different there are different ways in which this very pattern which is how four is united into one can manifest itself and there is of course a christian version of this which is there are many because the the five or the how four moves into one can be represented as the pentagram but it can also be represented in another way which is the way that we often represent it in on a die for example and so where you have the four corners and you have a point in the center which is uniting the four corners together so if you imagine the the four corners and the one in the middle like this you know you can think that you could flip it this way and then you would have the four corners with the the middle corner above and then you have a pyramid you know whether you imagine in the middle or above it has the kind of the same the same meaning let's say another example of this is in the notion of the chariot and so the manner in which four moves into one is represented in scripture in the story of the divine chariot in the story of the merkabah where the prophet has a vision of these four beasts these four cherubs that are on the corners and they are they have their their own wheels and you have this sense that they're they are moving and then the rider descends upon the chariot the son of man descends and this becomes the vehicle for the glory of god to manifest itself and so i mean it's not think about the arc of the covenant for example which has the same pattern you have the four corners of the arc you have a box and then on top of the box then you have the glory of god which descends and is the manner in which the box or the stability of manifestation unites itself into a head okay so that's basically the notion of the pentagram or the four that moves into one like i said is not just limited to a pentagram and you have christian virgins of that the the two christian virgins that you can see of that are related to each other one is the the the image of christ in glory with the four glories on the side and so you have christ and his head and you have the halo in the middle of christ which is the head the way in which the four unite and then you have the four beasts on the corners and those four beasts are also the four evangelists so you can imagine a structure where you have the four gospels the four evangelists the four beasts and then christ which unites this multiplicity together into one and it really is an image about how reality works and how multiplicity creates multiplicity four creates a stable stability because you have two sets of opposites you have this this vehicle that is actually stable whereas duality doesn't have that capacity and neither does does three because three is dynamic it has a dynamic quality which is that the three are always related to each other in a more dynamic quality which is why the trinity is a is three but four has this kind of stable incarnate manner it's all obviously like i said you can imagine your arms and your legs this these two feet below and then these two arms acting in the world or you can imagine an animal with four legs and then above a house all of this four and one another version of how the pentagram or the four moving into one appears is in the very structure of an orthodox church which has a dome in the center and you have christ up in the dome at the top of the pattern and then you have on the side you have what's called pendentives these pendentives are four corners that move into columns that hold up the dome and the four corners are like are really like four points there these are four points in the corners and in the the top so you can imagine it of course straight like in a die where you see the four dots and the one in the middle but but because it's a dome it's obviously flipped like i told you like this before the four corners and then the rider at the top or the summit of the pyramid or the summit of the of this four at the top okay um and so that is really let's say this understanding of the pentagram but it can also have dark implications just like any type of symbolism it can also represent the idea of will as supreme over the world let's say and so the idea of man who rules over the four elements uh there are different ways of understanding it and that's why in magical rituals a pentagram might be used in order to subject reality to your will in order to create a space in which you are capable of influencing the the way the world lays itself out through ritual and through magical uh pronunciations okay um so that's the basic idea of a pentagram now the reason why the pentagram upside down pentagram ended up being used in satanism has to do with the idea of black magic right so you can imagine you have white magic with the the pentagram going up and the the four moving into one above and then you have black magic which was the opposite which is upside down that's why we say an upside down pentagram or which i mean it's it's kind of funny because obviously the idea that this geometric shape has a right side up and a and a you know upside down is obviously might seem arbitrary at first but it's not arbitrary once you can see that we intuitively find meaning in this type of symbolism um so you can imagine that the upside down pentagram is the opposite it's something like the source of unity comes from multiplicity it's something like uh giving in to multiplicity in order to find some kind of power that'll concentrate in you and so you can imagine that's why it's something like invoking demons it's uh you know uh giving up your soul to receive some kind of particular power that is going to land down down there um so you can understand why that would be satanic in the sense that that's what satanism is right satanism is an upside down reality it's a giving in to your ends up being a giving into your different passions giving into the and it is in a certain way it's kind of atheistic and it believes that multiplicity can give unity and so that's why it appears upside down and that's also why it's the image of the goat the goat that you see in um kind of black magic symbolism has to do with the goat in scripture the goat that is cast out the goat that is given to azazel and so there is a sense in kind of upside down uh black magic that this residue like the stuff that you that you throw away has a kind of power if you're able to tap into it if you tap into the into the residue then there's something hidden in that power that you can use to give yourself uh authority and so if i had said that to you 100 years ago or 200 years ago you might have thought that i'm just making it up or that it's arbitrary but you just have to look around you and notice that all of the social narrative right now all of the power is going to those who are able to tap in to the power of the residue tap into the power of that which doesn't fit in tap into the power of the exception of the leftover of all this idea of the margin this is how the current social narrative is being run is in a black magic manner by tapping into this exception and giving place and giving room to the exception so you all of this can help you understand the kind of black magic symbolism the idea of using uh residues of other people's bodies like hair or uh or menstrual blood and all of these things that are that are dead and that are that are cast away from the body that all of this imagery is related to black magic uh also the idea of having some kind of sexual intercourse with strangers with prostitutes with ugly people like al sacraly did all these kinds of horrible rituals where he would have relationships with with with kind of uh disgusting people all of this is to tap into this this uh this power of the residue and the power of the margin and the power of the exception all of this all of this is a is a tool let's say in order to gain power in yourself but the inverted pentagram has way more implications than that because you could say that inverted pentagram is pretty much the basic pattern of a lot of what people believe and so when someone says that there is such a thing as democracy whereas the the will of the of all the the multiplicity somehow really does coalesce into one when people believe for example that you can derive value from facts when scientists believe that you can arrive at value from facts then they are in an inverted pentagram every time that uh you know every time that people um believe also that the world just emerges out of chaos without any form of spirit without any form of unity at the top and that everything comes from below let's say in all of these in all of its multiplicity right the idea that out of different chemical elements could just happen to come together and to form consciousness this is all an upside down vision of reality and it is all that's a standing inside the uh the upside down pentagram so you can see why in my video where i talk about the kind of satanic tropes i'm alluding to the to the fact that really modernism and modern culture is a form of it's a form of satanic manifestation and i say it like almost like in a technical way i want to be careful because everybody all of us in the west have made the mistake of believing this and of participating this to a certain extent um and uh and so it's every time that you don't want to submit to something above you right that's the inverted pentagram right it's it's just another manifestation of that okay um and so you need to and so once again we need to be careful i mean obviously the set the inverted pentagram i would never use that image because it's so now tied to the satanic that you know and it makes sense it's coherent the symbolism of it is completely coherent it's not arbitrary at all but there could there are versions of that that appear strangely and that are not necessarily tied to evil itself so for example uh there is a church in europe where there is in the northern transept in the window there is a inverted pentagram in the northern window and so you can wonder like what is it that they're trying to why would they have an inverted pentagram in the window and uh you can it doesn't take very long to kind of understand why they would put that there especially if you understand the architecture of a church as being the totality of all things especially if you understand the reason why there are gargoyles or there are um there are griffins on the outside of churches a lot of orthodox think they get out of it because they don't have gargoyles on the outside of the churches well a lot of greek churches had griffins on the outside of churches which are just just a form of gargoyle really um and so the reason why you why they would have put let's say an upside down pentagram at the northern transept is because the northern transept is the dark transept it is the left side when you walk into a church and you're looking east the northern transept is left it's recognized as the place where the sun never is never there and usually in the northern transept there are strange it's there they're often strange imagery especially in kind of french uh gothic cathedrals there are weird imageries from the old testament for example a lot of images of foreigner the queen of sheba i went i think it was in in a shaft or in uh maybe not or maybe it was uh in notre dame in paris they have images of the story of the golden hemorrhoids you know on the beasts where the art goes out into the into the foreigner into the foreign land to the wilderness um like i said the queen of sheba and the images of these strangers that are in old the old testament and so it's the place of the unknown the place of darkness the place of you know this residue like in the story of the of the um the golden hemorrhoids for example and ultimately all of this plays a part in the story like all of this is part of reality sometimes uh sometimes even even despite the people who are embodying the symbolism one of the things i hinted at in my article on the american conservative is how these satanists you know they they think they're being really clever and they think they're being really smart but ultimately they're actually without even knowing what they're doing they're going to participate in the return of christianity just like by killing christ the satan didn't understand that he was participating in the salvation of the world this symbolism this kind of dark upside down symbolism will ultimately and inevitably call back to the other side will inevitably be like this strange dark mirror that at some point uh will inevitably call back the normal order of things and a return of the logos and so maybe that can give you a little bit of hope in these dark times and so uh make sure you understand what i said i'm not saying that you should be sporting upside down pentagrams and you should be sporting all that like i said it is especially the way it's used today a a very dark and coherent imagery um but rather just understand that christ is stronger than all of this that god is is above and beyond these considerations and that uh you know the story is going to play out how it's going to play out and truth will always win in the end and so i hope this was useful in kind of understanding a little bit the symbolism of the upside down pentagram and thank you everybody for your support and i'll talk to you very soon
