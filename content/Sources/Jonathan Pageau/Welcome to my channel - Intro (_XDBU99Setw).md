 My name is Jonathan Pesio and I'd like to welcome you to my channel. What are you going to see on this channel? Well, I am an artist, I am a writer, I'm also a public speaker, but most of all I'm someone who sees patterns and beauty in the world. And I see these patterns as the way our consciousness engages with the world around us, makes sense of it, engages with it. But also this beauty and this pattern seems to me to be a glimpse of something more. And so as an artist you'll see me exploring these patterns through carving. I'm a professional icon carver. As a writer and a speaker, well on this chain I'll be putting up all the conferences that I give, all the talks I'm invited to give in North America. And then I'm also producing videos for this channel specifically. And these will explore patterns and symbolism in the Bible, in art, but also in popular culture. I'm also going to be having some interesting discussions with people, interviews. So hopefully I'll find you in the comments section. Feel free to comment. I read all the comments. I'm not able to answer everything, but I try to engage with people as much as possible. And so I'm starting on this adventure and I hope people will be excited to join me and to discover how beautiful the world can be.
