 So hello everybody as many of you know for those who've been following me on social media for the last month or so Even more I have been working on this giant marble Monument and been carving all day up to 11 hours a day and because of that I've had a lot of time to listen to podcasts, you know, the YouTube Sometimes plays and I'm just listening and sometimes it ends up on these, you know autoplay goes on and I Wounded up listening to a podcast between Joe Rogan and Douglas Murray Some of you might have heard this podcast in which they talk about all the things that Douglas Murray is interested in But during the discussion they start to talk about Bible stories and Christianity and they start to make fun of different aspects of The Bible and so I thought I would look into at least one of those stories to maybe you know I like Douglas and I like Joe but I'd maybe I can help all of you understand this story in particular it's the story of Elisha and the two mother bears that killed the 42 youths This is Jonathan Peugeot welcome to the symbolic world So in this discussion Joe Rogan and Douglas Murray start talking about The The idea of wool and linen and how it's so, you know disturbing that in the Old Testament You can't mix the two types of cloth by the way for those who want you can check out I actually made a video on that subject trying to explain why it's important So you can check that out. I'll probably put a link of that down below in the description But that's not what I want to talk about now. What I want to talk about is the story of Elisha Which was the book where the guy? Called upon the she bear to kill the children who were mocking his baldness Do you know about that one? No my favorite especially as a bald guy in that story Elisha with Elijah who is his master there are two prophets and Elijah is going to go away and In order to go away, they cross this river They cross the Jordan River and then Elijah is taken up into heaven and as Elijah is taken up into heaven then Elisha receives these garments of Elisha and receives a double Take a double portion of the spirit of Elijah and these garments are these Woolly garments these hairy garments that the prophets wore. Let's call them these garments of skin And so Elisha gets these garments and with the garments he hits the Jordan and the Jordan separates into two and then Elisha crosses over and Then on the other side as he's moving about I think it's the the second story There's a story just before that but the second story after that is this story where a bunch of views come up to him And they start to mock him and they call him Baldi and they're saying hey Baldi get out of here Baldi get out of here and because of that Elisha turns to them gets angry Curses them and then these two mother bears come out and they devour all these young men it says devour 42 of them, so I can understand Joe and and Douglas if you ever listen to this I can understand why you find that story strange But I would say you have to be very careful and I hope that you know I think this podcast was a bit old and I think now that you've Been listening to Jordan Peterson a little bit more Hopefully you'll have a little bit more reserved when you start making fun of these stories And so I am going to explain the story to you Now To understand the story Just like most stories in the Bible you have to understand the patterns you have to understand that this story of Elisha and the she bears is a repetition of Patterns which were there before their repetition of I will show you one of the example of this pattern now Noah he Comes to the end of a world you know and Enoch is taken up into heaven just like Elijah is taken up into heaven and after that Noah Noah has to cross an expanse of water just like Elisha had to cross the Jordan Noah doesn't use the garments of skin of animal skins, but he has a boat full of animals which is Symbolically very similar and so Elisha uses these garments of animal skins to cross over the water And so what he's doing is he's actually in this moment of transition He's crossing over to a new world a new beginning you could call it But in the new beginning in this transitional space a lot of things can happen a lot of crazy things can happen And when Noah crosses over after that there's a story where just after he crosses the the flood Noah is Takes his clothes off gets drunk and then he's lying there naked You know in his tent and his son comes in and sees that he is Naked and then he goes to tell his brothers now what's implied in the story Is that he's making fun of his father or he's criticizing his father for being naked in the tent and then because of that the son of Noah who saw him is Cursed and he becomes like a cursed people in the world and you think huh that's strange Well, you can see first of all you first of all have to see the pattern now notice the pattern Elisha crosses the waters with these garments of animal skins Then when he's on the other side he is criticized for something that he lacks He's criticized for his nakedness in this case the fact that he's bald the fact that you can see his head and so this notion of criticizing What the notion of exposing the nakedness of someone of This is an important theme in the Bible the idea that when you do something certain things that you can do will expose Someone's nakedness will expose their vulnerability will expose their weakness and the danger in doing that is There's a a process By which that will then turn against you and that will Create something like a curse against you the curse of the mother bear that comes out and eats and eats them You can really imagine it as this kind of grumbling feminine energy that comes up and then devours you like a like a like a Sea monster coming out and eating Jonah or you know this idea of the Of this chaos kind of pulling you down, let's say and so that's what it refers to now the reason why it's she bears reason why it's animals has to do with this idea of covering and this idea of the animal skins the idea of the animals in the ark this idea that we cover ourselves with Let's say These animal desires that we have around us they they act as a way to protect ourselves in the world everybody understands that so You know you're hungry you have sexual desire all these things are there to help you survive in a in a difficult world And but they're also the thing that can pull you down You know so if you let yourself go too much to your hunger then you become fat you become you know You're taken over by that passion if you let yourself get taken over by your sexual desires Then you become obsessed with that and you you you lose your focus you can get a disease you you know everything about letting yourselves go to these passions that kind of eat you up and drag you and so the danger of Exposing someone else's nakedness of exposing someone else's lack is that Then you will become you will be eaten by the thing that you are criticizing them for lacking and so you see that the children criticize the nakedness of The nakedness of Elisha and then they're eaten by These animal passions that you could imagine that they're eaten by Elisha's garments of skin those skins that he used to cross over those skins that he used to survive in the world now Still I know a lot of you will think what does it mean? What are you talking about? What is this? What does this have to do with anything? Well? We are going through that Right now we are experiencing exactly this story of Elisha and the 42 use are being eaten right now It's called the me too movement Some people in Hollywood some actors thought it on On took it on themselves and Hollywood in general to criticize certain behaviors to poke at the nakedness at the weaknesses of others in high power and then what happened those very people who accused others of That weakness then all these Women appeared and started to say yeah But you too you you are guilty of the thing that you're accusing me of and those people got Devoured by their own Weaknesses and so that which we hide we have these these these sins we have these passions that we hide for a reason You know there are many reasons why we hide our passions one is so that society can continue One is that because we're ashamed of them one is that because we're trying to hopefully Trying to get away from these passions, but when you expose someone else's passions Then you run into the danger that those passions will then devour the person who's criticizing You know and you see it. It's so funny because it's a trope that everybody understands We've seen it we've seen even people for example. We've seen the the gay lobby use that exact structure They'll say things like if you criticize Homosexuality if you're openly critical to people who are gay it probably means that you Secretly have that desire in you and that you will give in and be eaten up by that desire And then they can point to different conservative pastors or priests or whatever who are found you know in some Some gay orgy or something and so and so that is the structure of this story And I think I think it's a it's something that once you understand the pattern you can see First of all the pattern itself repeats itself in the Bible there are other places where this same pattern repeats itself but then once you understand what it means then you can understand that Understand that knowing this pattern can avoid a lot of problems in your life And so I would say to all of you just before you Casually mock a story in the Bible be very careful because there's probably Actually certainly more there than what you thought at the outset So I hope you enjoyed my discussion of Elisha and the two bears if you want to go down this rabbit hole I have talked about this before several times on my channel if you watch a video Called Adam and Eve and Batman you will see that I discussed this very pattern how Batman uses his giving in to fear at the death of his parents to then turn fear against the criminals and Destroy them by the very thing that exposed his own weakness and his own vulnerability So this is a pattern that you can find all over the place and so thank you again for listening and watching Don't forget my new website WWW.thessymbolicworld.com if you like what I'm doing, please consider supporting me on patreon, and I will see you soon
