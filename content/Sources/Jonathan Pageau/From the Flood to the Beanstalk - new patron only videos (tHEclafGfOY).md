 So hello to all as many of you know in late April the end of April 2019 My family was flooded and we had to move out of our house in a rush in 15 minutes we lost everything that was in the basement and we ended up having to leave our house move into a new house that we're renting and Until now we are still not back in our house It has been pretty crazy. If you follow me on social media You'll see that I'm barely posting any carvings because I'm not having been able to get to carving I didn't have space and also at some point my tools and my stones were in different places Because we we left so fast. I had to gather everything together Luckily I've been doing a lot of traveling doing a lot of speaking events and so that has in a way Compensated for that but all of that is over now So we're I'm coming to a point where I should start carving but now we have to move again the place where we're renting Was a house that was for sale it has been sold and within before the mid-august we have to leave and so All this is kind of putting us in in a whole bunch of chaos. So people have helped us so much on Through crowdfunding go fund me people sending me money directly. We've been able to amass a Pretty good amount but now it seems like we're going to have to go back We're probably gonna have to go back to the house to our house and if we go back to our house It's going to be considered a floodable area and we do not want to put our kids back in the basement And so on the one hand we can't sell our house. We have to go back to our house on the other hand we have to We have to find a way for us to be able to live in that house because I we had the rooms there We had my office there and so it seems like the only solution for us is to put a second floor on the house and Not use the basement for anything important to kind of just leave it as a General space or something like that So that is a situation I'm in now and I and because I'm not able to carve what I've decided to do and If you notice I've been putting out a lot of videos because I have time to do it I've been making some drawings trying to find other ways to maintain my revenue stream So I've decided that what I'm gonna start doing from now on is to put out one video a month that is going to be only For patrons and the subject is going to be traditional stories fairy tales on the different patronage platforms You can follow the you can decide we'll be able to vote which Stories are going to be chosen but for the first video I'm going to do the secret meaning of Jack and the beanstalk which is already up right now for patrons only And we look at Jack and the beanstalk what its relation is to the story of Jacob in the Bible what its relation is to The notion of revolution and to the problem of a hierarchy which prevents the things from higher above How it can prevent things from coming down and so some interesting thought you can check that out if you have been thinking of supporting me Financially for the past year or whatever and you just haven't gotten to it I would say that this would be a good time to do it because Because I'm going to be focusing on the videos until I find a permanent solution To get back to carving the way it should be and so once again everybody I thank you for Your continuing support both those that have been helping us Directly with the gofundme campaign and those that are supporting me on patreon I will try to to do my best to rise up to your expectations of me and and so yeah Check out the the jack and the beanstalk video if you are already a patron and if not you can follow me through Subscribe star through my website or through patreon as well, so I will see you soon
