 There's one last really interesting thing about emotionally turbulent relationships and why human beings are more attracted to them. This kind of explains why you can't get away from your toxic ex. Sometimes we're confused, like, why don't I just, like, stop seeing this person? I know it's bad for me, but I can't help myself. So it turns out that there's a lot of really interesting neuroscience and physiology about what attracts us to our toxic exes. So there's a really fascinating study that was done where they had people dating, and the only difference between dates was that one was on a bridge that was made of stone, and the other is on a bridge that was, like, rickety. And what they sort of found is that the emotional fear of the rickety bridge made people fall in love with each other more. That anytime you're in an emotionally unstable environment, it causes people to bond. And so one really interesting thing about red flag relationships is that early, like, turbulence in the relationship creates actually a lot of negative emotion, and then you'll kind of bind together and work through it.
