 So sometimes we have a relationship between a broken person and a whole person. One person who's got their crap together, another person who doesn't have their crap together. So these relationships can start out very lopsided, right? Because one person is doing the caring of, and one person is being cared for. And that can be okay for some amount of time. I've seen those relationships actually work out, but the goal there is that, you know, both people have to be invested in trying to take care of each other, in trying to support each other, and trying to help each other grow. But you may be asking, but if I'm the busted one, how do I help my partner grow if they have all their crap together? Well, you help your partner grow and you support them by investing heavily in yourself so that they don't have to carry all the time, right? Like it's in recognizing that, okay, the thing that I can do the most for my partner right now is in taking care of myself and getting myself into such a place where they don't have to take care of me, where I can start taking care of them.
