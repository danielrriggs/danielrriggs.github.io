 I grew up the kid of two doctors and my dad, when I was like nine years old, was like, I have an older brother and he's like, one of y'all is gonna be a doctor and one of y'all is gonna be a lawyer. And so I went to college and I was gonna be pre-med and I wanted to go to Harvard and all that stuff and I failed out because I was doing it because I should. And then paradoxically, what happened is I stopped caring about what I should do and I really just wanted to learn everything that I could about how a human being works. And as I devoted myself to that, it was really bizarre. When I graduated from medical school, I went to Tufts for medical school. I didn't even go to the award ceremony because I didn't think I would ever get an award because I'm failing out. And I was like at the top of my class. And I like wasn't even there to get it. And I just never even looked at my grades. Wow. And so ended up matching and it was really bizarre because the second that I stopped caring about what I should do and devoted myself to something that I really cared about is when I achieved all the things that I had set out to achieve.
