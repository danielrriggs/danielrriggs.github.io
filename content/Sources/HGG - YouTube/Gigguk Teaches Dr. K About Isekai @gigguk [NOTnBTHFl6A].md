 There's this genre in anime, it's called isekai, and the entire point of this genre is that it's about a person who's been transported to another world. And I'm not sure if I've liked that idea, I always subconsciously gravitate to kind of like being in another world, enveloping the world of the author, and just something that's a bit detached from a story that's more grounded. Do people who are in isekai anime, do they feel at home in their world? A lot of the times, no. I'll be honest, isekai anime isn't that deep. This is like, this is purely like a surface level thing. A lot of modern isekai anime is about a guy who is normally a nerd, or like is bullied, and then he goes to another world, and then he becomes a super ultra powerful person, and gets all the girls and stuff like that. And to me, it's just like, this is just like junk food to me. Sounds like he's a misfit in one area, and belongs in another area. Wow, why you gotta do me like that, man?
