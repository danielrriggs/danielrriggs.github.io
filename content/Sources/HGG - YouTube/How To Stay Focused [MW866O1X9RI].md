 If you're struggling to get engaged with a task, there are two things that you can do to put yourself in the use stress state. So I used to be pretty good at RTS games. And then eventually, like when I played with my friends, like I'd always dumpster, right? Cause I'm Dr. K right here, son. And so what I would start to do to like make things interesting for myself, and you know this if you're a pro gamer, is you'll like start to restrict internally the limits that the units you can use, right? So I was playing Starcraft and I would go like all fire bat. So I'd like pick some lame, stupid unit that like isn't that good, but I'm gonna see if I can challenge myself and lol, if I can crush them with only fire bats, it will make me an even more epic gamer. And this is also something that I use for people who are bored by school, which is that I'll tell them, okay, instead of like trying to learn the material, pretend that you are going to teach the material a week from now, or pretend that you are going to tutor in the material a year from now. And so by sort of increasing the difficulty of the task internally, it'll activate more cortisol, recruit your RAF and keep you engaged.
