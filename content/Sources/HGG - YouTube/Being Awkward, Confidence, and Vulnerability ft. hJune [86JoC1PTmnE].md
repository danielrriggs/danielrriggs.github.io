 Like even even sheesh. Do you know sheesh? No. Is that a person or a thing? Okay, i'll do it once for you. Okay. Are you ready? Yeah Awesome Nice to meet you. Dr. K. Nice to meet you too. What do you go by friend? Um, you can call me harrison or you can call me asian doesn't really matter Um, what would you what would you prefer? I think most people call me jun jun. Okay jun it is then are we going to be able to are are we doing a video interview today jun? No, no, no, I don't usually do face cam. Okay. Sure. So then let me just make a quick adjustment Okay, um, so tell me a little bit about what you'd like to talk about today and how I can be helpful Oh I think I want to talk about like maybe three topics maybe Maybe one of the three topics if we have enough time. Sure um, I think one of them is like um, like opening up and and friendships and like relationships Because I feel like um, I can make friends really easily but at the surface level because I feel like um If I if I think of like really close friends, right like best friends Like people usually open up about like super personal stuff Uh-huh, but then like I tend to never do that to other people where I talk about myself Because I feel like I don't Really have a moment where I feel like I need to do that Because I feel like I deal with it alone anyways but then because I don't do that, I feel like Friendships end up just at the surface level and I want to change them somehow. Why do you want to change that? Because I want closer friends And what makes you want closer friends, I know it's kind of a weird question I think having a lot of friends is Actually not as good as having a few really close friends So you value close friendships Have you ever had a close friend Uh, yeah, I like close friends from high school. Okay. Are you a yeah, go ahead. Sorry Yeah, we were able to get like, you know really close but As time goes on, you know, like you kind of drift apart right because absolutely everyone goes different paths So there's not that many times that you can like hatch out with them So you meet new friends that are For example, like if you're a streamer you meet other streamer friends And what do you think it is that makes it hard for you to open up Hmm I just don't feel the need to Like it's just like kind of random to just talk about personal stuff with someone that you just met not too long ago Yeah, so That's the first thing I you know, I asked you kind of a weird question Which is like why do you want close friends? Because I think the first the first question is is really like to think a little bit about You know, is there is there a part of you that wants to open up but can't Or I know this sounds kind of weird but like another possibility is that You sort of know theoretically that like people have close friends and you've had close friends before but it's actually not something that you actually need right now What do you think about that But I think that also ties into my real question But I think that also ties into my relationships too where Um Like if you don't open up to anybody then how are you supposed to get emotionally attached to them, right? Do you want to be emotionally attached to people? Yeah, I think I i'm not i'm not one to get like super lonely and stuff like that, but I think Especially with you know, the covid and stuff Like I feel like hmm if I do this I might end up single until i'm like 40 or something Okay And are you so So I know this sounds weird jun but like is the reason that you want to open up to people because you want to avoid being single at the age of 40 No, no Why do you want to reason? Okay That's very helpful. No, I just feel like it's it's just better to have you know, like let's say I do have a moment I do have a moment where I do need people right? then I don't really have that moment right now But I know later on there's eventually gonna be you know moments like that where I need someone But then like if I never did that with anyone then it would be kind of weird to just like do it out of the blue, right? Yeah, but I do love listening to other people though Okay, so so I know this is gonna sound kind of weird jun and maybe i'm just missing something because I Sometimes I when I can't see people's faces i'll like misplay a little bit so apologies But but i'm hearing you sort of say a lot of logical reasons why it's good to open up to people Like oh like what if I need someone one day? Right so so but that's kind of interesting because what i'm hearing there is that I should open up to people So if we thought to think about like there's like what i'm hearing from you is that you know in your mind You're kind of saying oh, it's like it's a good idea to open up and form connections with people But there's a difference between like it being a good idea and it being something that you want I think I want to I think you do too, but I do see it in a logical way as well Yep So I think this is where like we've got to get underneath the logic to try to get at what? The wanting is because when I ask you about your motivations I get a logical answer. Does that make sense? Yeah, that makes sense. You see I watched your interviews before and then you'd always ask why what do you what do you say that? I thought that was very interesting and that was happening to me so cool what i'm confused. You just lost me You're getting to the bottom of it and I usually don't do that with myself And I just thought that was really cool. So so I think that what we're seeing here. I know this sounds kind of weird but like so like June this is going to be weird because like i'm gonna try to get you to open up Right, but that's not what you want to do. You want to want to open up Does that make sense? Yeah, so you want to be someone who wants to open up Yes, but you don't actually want to open up I think I just don't know how to like how do how do people Get to the point where people open up. Yeah, totally totally fine. So we'll we'll we'll try to get you there. Okay, jun Okay So a big piece of this is going to be like so what i'm when I say that you are someone who wants to be someone Who wants to open up? So like you're striving to be someone who opens up Right because that's good and that's healthy and you just don't know how to so if we think about is that fair we on the same page now So if we think about what keeps people from opening up like So it's almost like something's holding you back And so the the blockage is between Opening up like I don't know how to say this but like you want to be someone who opens up So there's something holding you back from being what you want to be. Does that make sense? Mm-hmm. So we're gonna dig into that. So can you tell me about your relationships? Uh, like friendship wise You use the word relationships. I don't know what you're referring to there whatever you mean by that Oh, I meant like friendships and then you know also relationships because I feel like Well, okay just to you know, talk about myself a little bit, please. Um Like right out of high school. I went to college and then um Around the same time I started playing this game called rust Okay, so this like a survival, you know fps kind of game and then all I did really was, you know Play that game until like 18 to like 23 Okay, so basically my entire adult was playing that game and then eventually I made youtube videos and then I became a youtuber And then I started streaming and then I became a streamer and only recently where You know, i'm kind of getting burnt out of rust so i'm like venturing out into other games Okay, and then I met a lot of like new friends So because I made a lot of new friends I want to Like I like them a lot And I want to get close with them right but Because I don't I haven't usually done that Like I don't even I I don't like small talk So like even at the first step Like it's already doomed You know what I mean? What why is it doomed doomed? Because I feel like if you don't even small talk then how are you supposed to get to the the deep talk? Okay, does that make sense it makes a lot of sense So what i'm hearing you say is that like generally speaking the way that relationships progress is that you have some amount of small talk And then you progress to deep talk And do you say that you don't like small talk or are you not good at it? I'm probably not good at it Okay, where do you get that idea? Hmm, I just don't know what to say when we're talking about like Surface level stuff Do you know what to say when you're talking about deep level stuff? I think so. I'm really good at like listening to other people talk about deep stuff. But then when someone asks me it's like I don't really know what to say because let's say like someone's talking about like super emotional stuff, right? And then they ask me like was there a very like emotional moment for you or like that? I don't really know what to say because it's not really about like I think this also ties to my other topic that i'll talk about with you um, I feel like i'm too Emotionally moderate And what I mean by that is like I never get like super depressed, but also I don't get super happy either Okay, so like there's not that many like moments of vulnerability that I can really talk about with people Yeah, is do you think that that's a problem I think if I don't Talk about stuff like that with people then it's not really like a two-way thing, right? And you want it to be a two-way thing? Yeah, okay Can I think for a second jun? Yes You Can you tell me about your friends from high school Um Well, we're all gamers. We actually met uh playing league of legends together And uh, they're all very smart So basically I'll like sit with them and then the teacher that would think that i'm super smart, too So you're not super smart one of them Uh, I would say i'm above average but i'm not smart as them definitely not smart as them, okay All right, so you would sit with them and then the teachers would think you were super smart So what was that like Oh, that was great. So like in english clash class, um I sat next to the smartest Kid in my school, which is my best friend And then the second smartest So the english teacher was like yo, this guy must be smart. He must be like third smartest or something so even though I write like Maybe like a 86 level she still gave me like a 95 level great Hmm I'm confused by that So like no because she has like a pre Conception of what I will be like so like whatever she reads that I write It was it was better than what it what it was Okay, so you're saying that she had a cognitive bias that caused her to inflate to the value of your work Yes, okay, so let me ask you a question okay because you're a super logical dude and above average intelligence So, how would we know if you are a person who gets the benefit of a cognitive bias from a teacher? Or you're misjudging your own skill because of a cognitive bias on your part How do we know if the paper is really a 95 and that you believe you're you deserve an 86 Which is incorrect or whether your paper is an 86 and you actually deserve it and it gets inflated to a 95 So what would you say if you were a person who gets the benefit of a cognitive bias from a teacher? I would say yes Hmm I wouldn't know that I think I do that a lot though. I think you do too. Tell me tell me other other ways that you do that Are really good at that specific thing so for example Let's say it's like gaming, right? then If I wanted to be really good at a game, I would look at the very best The very best in the game and then I would constantly like try to Strive to get there And then I would just always assume that i'm always like under Yeah I think that's a good and bad thing Say more jun I'd agree 100% explain that to us, please Because I think that always like keeps like a fire underneath you to keep going but then um You wouldn't really have like satisfaction of getting somewhere because you're always under that Level that you want to get to see that's another thing I think I really hate the feeling of like being mediocre Yep you and me both um because Because like ever since high school I tried a lot of things right so in the high school I tried like Well, I still sing Like for fun But I really like singing I really like dancing like basketball Like I like gaming obviously But I felt like I was like never the best at something I was maybe like number two or like number three or like above average Is number two or number three above average I mean, I guess technically the answer is yes, but I don't think about number two or number three like I wouldn't You know like if I think about the silver medalist at the olympics You know like if I think about the silver medalist at the olympics I hope like when I think about that person I'd the the words above average is not what comes to mind But then I think How I was looking at it was like maybe i'm number two in the school But then like I would be like, oh, okay. The number one in my school is this guy, but then that guy is like number 500 million Sure in the world sure so Jun how can you tell me about like where like what growing up was like for you? Um In what way? What where did you grow up? What who lived with you at home? Oh, I lived in vancouver I grew up here. I'm korean um, so basically I learned korean first and then Learn english I have both my parents living with me even until now I have one older brother One older sister and they're much older than me So I always play like diablo 2 and play the same games that they played And and I think yeah go ahead I think it was a It was a good childhood. I can't really think of any like traumas sure I don't I don't have anything like Super bad I can think of sure a time where I was like super sad Yeah That's what I mean by being too emotionally moderate Like I don't really like take things too seriously So I I feel like there's no real significant highlight of my life yet Which kind of feels empty sometimes Can I think for a second jun? For sure Okay Let me just think okay Did your did you Compare yourself a lot to other people when you were young or did your parents like sort of compare you to other people when? You were young I think I just did that myself a lot My parents don't really do that. Do you have a sense of of how you started doing that? What when I see like a good quality in people like I want to Try to do the same So i'll see that quality in my my brother or my sister or maybe my classmates or maybe like someone older than me Or something I see on tv or whatever So and and I know this sounds kind of weird but like So i'm getting a sense that you strive to be more than you are Um, yeah, it's always about moving forward No, no explain that to all Always striving to move forward And the things that i'm passionate about not in like life or my career wise But if I really like gaming for example, i'm gonna always strive to be better Yeah, okay So so what i'm hearing you say is that it's true for the things that you're passionate about but not like every random thing Yeah, okay And so I have a weird question june. What do you like are you good enough? I think i'm good enough If you're good enough What makes you want to be better Because it doesn't give me satisfaction Then why do you think you're good enough? Well, I think being good enough doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to give you satisfaction what does give you satisfaction I think more than like career like milestones just like having fun With friends probably because I remember like distinctly like I so within the rust community Uh, I made like three tournaments last year called uh trust and rust It's like where we uh brought all the people from the rust community together All the creators all the streamers all the youtubers and then we did like a huge event And then we raised over like I think 200,000 in that year But then like when I was done I was like, oh Wow, that was great But then that that feeling was more like relief. Oh, it's it's over But I wasn't really like super satisfied But then When I play video games with friends and it was like a really fun night. I feel like I get more satisfaction from that then something like Doing something really cool. Like if you think logically raising all that money for charity and like helping all those people is awesome, right, but Didn't really give me that much satisfaction Okay so jun I'm noticing a couple of disconnects which which I probably need to like try to understand you a little bit better here um So on the one hand you're kind of telling me that like you always are looking at number one Right and and you kind of recognize that that's like adaptive because it sort of like keeps the fire going and keeps you improving And so I i'm sort of I I think we're running into a couple of different like Conflicts because I think if I ask you are you good enough? I wonder if i'm getting a logical answer But like you know, there's a part of me that sort of gets the sense that you're striving to be number one And until you're number one, you're not going to be like good enough or satisfied. What do you think about that? Yeah, I think you're right I think um good enough is like more like A logical answer. Yes. Yeah, so so like if I like because because like you said like, you know You're not like you don't have like super low self-esteem or anything. So like you think you're like a decent dude Right, you're above average. Mm-hmm Just a cut above mediocre Why is that funny No, no, no, sorry, no, I think it's I think we hit a nerve there I Know I think a lot of people would be satisfied if they were above average, but even if we even if I do like something really cool, I just I don't know. There's like I think it just stems back to like emotionally moderate I So I I agree so we'll get to so first of all juno, I want to commend you bro, like You've done a really good job of tying together. I think a lot of things that feel like that can seem really far apart But I really do think have a shared route So I think the emotional moderation the inability to open up all of this talk about like, you know being like never the smartest kid in the class And essentially like a bias that causes you to devalue where you are And and like what I mean by that is like, you know, you're getting 95s and you're friends with the two smartest kids in the class But you sort of don't think yours of yourself. Okay, maybe i'm the third smartest kid And I think if we if we look at like how that works It's because your mind will find some the second that you start to get towards the top What does your mind do? I know it's kind of like a really weird abstract like open-ended question So i'm just going to toss it out and then i'll give you like an answer But i'm curious if you're kind of can read my mind there for a second Right, so like like we kind of we kind of heard you say like Okay, even if I think about the number one in my high school, like what is that number one compared to the rest of the world? So like your mind plays this your mind plays this game of constantly moving goalposts Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think so right. So even if you rise to the top like what does your mind do? Does it let you say good job jun? You're number one No, it doesn't do that what does it do That moves a goalpost absolutely Right, so you're on this like treadmill You're on this like treadmill and no matter how far you move forward like You're never going to be satisfied What do you think about that i'm trying to find ways to get that satisfaction Yeah, well, so that's because like so you're so you're someone who's like walking on a treadmill instead of walking on a path And then you're asking me How do I get to the end of the road? Right where I think the problem is that like as long as you're on a treadmill it'll never end That's true So like even if you figure out what the treadmill is and what the path is Yeah, so I think the treadmill is that your mind continuously compare like so as soon as you get like even if you became the biggest Rust youtuber then your mind is like, okay, but what about the biggest? Rust streamer and then if you become the biggest rust streamer And then if you become the biggest rust streamer then it's like oh But there are people who play other games who are bigger than I am And then you start comparing yourself to them So what i'm hearing I usually don't think that way and like career wise though, do you feel satisfied in your career? I feel like right now because I don't have a game that I enjoy I don't have a game that I enjoy Like if i'm not passionate about something I don't really have that drive like right now I don't have that drive Yeah, so let me toss something back at you Okay, so you said that like if I have a fun night with my friends, then I feel satisfied Yeah, like I go to bed like satisfied. Oh, that was a good day. Yep. Yep. And so What goal post did you hit by having a good night with your friends? Like are you thinking about being number one No Right. So this is like an important thing to understand that satisfaction doesn't come from hitting the end of the road It comes from not walking on the road But the second you have a goal post and especially if you move the goal post you're never going to be satisfied Because we've seen moments where you have been satisfied But I think I know this sounds kind of like now we get to some of those generic, you know yoga calendar stuff But I think like in those moments you're like living in the present You're like today i'm going to play with my friends and we're going to do some cool stuff and like then you can feel satisfied But when you start living in the future when you start living towards goals When you start like thinking about becoming something Your mind won't let you be satisfied because like no matter how good you do it's going to advance the goal posts What do you think about that Yeah, I think just like Probably finding other ways to get satisfaction Like whether that's like, you know building friendships or I think one thing that did help me recently is Like having another avenue where I feel like i'm always making progress So like that could be like going through a gym or something Yeah, so I think so even if my goal post Is still there on somewhere else. I feel like i'm still moving on a different path Yeah, so jun now we get to something really hard, okay, like this is probably going to be like really challenging Because I think you're so You've come to rely on this part of yourself so much as a cornerstone of your success I think it's going to be really hard to let it go but like You know if you are progressing Progress can't come without dissatisfaction. Does that make sense? Like you're always striving to be more But like if you're striving to be more If you want to be better, that means that you're not happy with where you are Does that make sense That makes sense That makes sense So like I think there's this weird thing going on where like what you use to motivate you Dooms you to be unsatisfied Because it's never enough right like you need to see the progress to feel good about yourself But that progress implies that like you're not good enough because you need to be better And if you need to be better then like you're not good enough like those two come a hand in a hand Does that make sense? That makes sense Okay, so then like And this is where I think we see this like fundamental idea that you have that you're not good enough Play out in the school English teacher example Because if you believe you're not good enough and you get a 95 What does your mind conclude about why you got the 95? Was it because you did a good job Because I sat next to two two kids there you go, right so like it's weird because your mind starts From the foundation of like i'm not good enough. So even when life tells you like hey man, you did a great job You're like Uh, no, it's actually a cognitive bias because of where I sit in a classroom My score is nine points higher than where it deserves My score is nine points higher than where it deserves to be like just think about that for a second, bro Like i'm sure that teachers have cognitive biases, but usually those cognitive biases have to do people who kiss their ass Not like where do they sit in the classroom? That's true And they usually don't have like a nine point swing unless you really are like, you know stuff in your nose way up there Right, okay, I definitely did Yeah, so it's it's interesting, right? And so now we get to opening up because like I I know this sounds kind of weird but like If you open up to people like what do you think they'll see? The vulnerable side yeah, but what is in the vulnerable side What is in the vulnerable side Yeah, so this is where i'm going to try to help you out. Okay, so like i'm going to give you a hypothesis Whereas like I think that sometimes the reason that we have difficulty opening up Is because we believe that what is on the inside is ugly Like that's the biggest problem Like that's the biggest reason to not be vulnerable because You don't want to show people like what's ugly Right, like you can think about people who like are self-conscious about going to the beach because of the body that is underneath their clothes Like who's self-conscious about going to the beach? It's like people who are like embarrassed to have you know like flabby stomach or whatever And so like like the people who hesitate to be vulnerable are the ones that have something to hide Does that make sense That makes a lot of sense but if I try to think like what Things I can talk about I don't I don't really know. I'm trying to think like am I am I hiding something because i'm trying to like, you know listen to what you're saying, right, but I don't know if I have Have that Yep, I make sense. I I think that it it seems It seems very inaccessible to me talking to you. So we'll get to that in a second but something that I I want you to kind of play around with is like You know, I suspect jun that you know, I mean, I don't know this could be wrong But like I think there's this weird like complex of like not being good enough which strives you to be better So you love it But that also means that like you never view yourself as good enough And if you never view yourself as good enough, like it can be hard to open up to people because like what are you displaying to them? Like what do you want to show the world like what do you want people to see you as jun? Um, just a fun guy to be around Yeah, and so if you start telling people like and what are you? I think I think i'm a fun guy to be around okay Right, so I I think this is where if you want to be a fun guy to be around like and you start Sharing your vulnerabilities with them. Like what are you then? So, what are you doing? I'm a fun friend to be around. I don't think so man, right because I don't think you're fun anymore So now we get to like a couple of interesting questions these are shots in the dark, okay So on the one hand like maybe we're just digging like I don't really know The first question is have you ever opened up to someone and like been hurt by it? Have I opened up to someone and been hurt by it? Have I opened up to someone and been hurt by it? Yeah And specifically like we can even like I can ask you very specifically like has there been a case where You felt like someone pulled away from you because you showed them a side of jun that is not fun and fun to be around That's the thing I don't think i've done that yet, okay, that's totally fine So other option is have you been on the receiving end of that? where have there been sort of situations where like people have opened up to you or And then like you've sort of seen or you yourself have withdrawn from someone because they show you a part of them I know you're a really good listener So this is probably unlikely but have there been situations where like You kind of pulled back or you saw other people pull back from someone who's vulnerable I think i've seen other people that like told me vulnerable things and then pulled back themselves because they you know Kind of exposed that and maybe they thought that I would think differently of them or whatever Yeah, but how and what ended up happening there so they pulled back and did you let them or I think it slowly kind of like drifted apart probably I think it's like I think it's like Jun I feel like we're missing something. What do you think? I think I think it's um I think we're focusing too much on like not being good enough part Because I don't that's not my main issue. Okay So what should we be focusing on instead and what's your main issue? That's very helpful feedback, by the way, thank you I'm trying to think as well I Think in terms of like friendships and relationships I think like for example, let's say In high school I was probably Afraid to start a relationship because if I did I was scared of the aftermath Because I hate conflict So I hate the awkwardness And I feel like um in the friendships things too if I open up and if someone else opens up And then they felt uncomfortable with that then there's the awkwardness as well Okay, what do you what help help me understand what you hate about the awkwardness You You know like the awkwardness when you let's say date someone and then Like you're in the same friend group or whatever or whatever And then there's like that tension there as well like if you didn't date It wouldn't be awkward for anyone involved So you're trying to protect people or yourself from the awkwardness Yeah, I think for myself, yeah So June, do you mind if I you don't have to answer this? So i'm gonna ask a pretty specific personal question. Are you in a relationship right now? No No, have you been in a relationship that's serious before? Um, not a serious one Can you tell me about a relationship that you have been in? Uh, yeah, it's quite a long time ago though Yeah, tell me about it Um It was more of like The girl liked me. So I was like, oh a cute girl likes me. So, you know, I got into the relationship um But then I think I learned from that relationship that you shouldn't really like Get into a relationship just because you're lonely And the other person's lonely and then you know, you have less like infatuation because like The aftermath is like oh, I don't want to see that person anymore Oh, I don't want to see their like Friends anymore either so I feel like just makes everything like kind of uncomfortable Okay, so what happens in a relationship Um, it's mostly like just too different Yeah, so so that's maybe why the relationship Kind of ended but can you help me understand like what it looked like from the outside or what the sequence of sort of events were? I was like super young. I was like 14 so Have you been in a relationship since then? No How do you feel about that? Um I don't really have strong like super strong feelings about it, but I do feel like i'm missing out Because because I focus so much on like rust like from my 18 to like 23 Like I didn't really travel that much. I didn't really live life I didn't really date Didn't really go outside. So I do feel like i'm missing out and maybe that's like Part of the reason why i'm not satisfied with all the other things Because i'm only focused on one thing Okay So when you say missing out So when you say missing out, how does that feel? Missing out how does that feel? If that question is hard for you I can ask it a different way Sure. Do you ever think about what the consequences of missing out are? You don't know what it's like What does that mean for you going forward? Makes me curious Really? Mm-hmm That's why I want to travel more once um It gets better with coven and stuff June do you ever feel like What I was expecting to hear was something along the lines of actually like being a little bit afraid that like once you've missed out Like it's really hard Because like now like everyone's kind of past you right and so if you try to like date someone Sometimes people will feel like oh like she's gonna be more experienced than I am And like i'm not really gonna be sure like it'll be awkward Do you ever have thoughts like that? Not really interesting, okay See, I think I know what kind of questions you're asking and I know I know the answers that could be said but like It's I don't know. It's just not like that for me Yep, and I know I know I know people can be like, oh he's just hiding it but like I don't My my feeling of dissatisfaction is that It's it's that I don't really feel those things and that's what makes it feel empty Yeah, so it looks like what we're coming back to So I i'm really happy you said that june Because I I don't think that just because you know, so like we can it's just as important to close off the wrong paths as it is to Find the right one So in medicine, you know, we have this concept called differential diagnosis And like, you know if someone has a fever like maybe it's the flu Maybe it's the flu You know if someone has a fever like maybe it's the flu maybe it's covet maybe it's you know strap throat Maybe it's lymphoma Or lupus And sometimes in medicine we have to order tests not to necessarily find the right diagnosis But we'll order a test to make sure it isn't lymphoma and order a test to make sure it isn't lupus And so we can almost use like a process of elimination approach And so I think I think part of what we're doing here today is sort of a process of elimination approach What do you think? Yeah, I had a tough time answering those questions actually Yep, and if you think about it, it's like really simple questions Why do you think you have a tough time answering them? Because I think if you ask like like how do you feel about that, right? It's like I think that's the thing. I didn't really feel anything about that. Yep, and so I feel like I feel like that would be like a Super mundane answer But then like if I said anything else, it would be it would be a lie. Yep And so how do you feel about giving me unda- mundane answers? Hey, you know what I think I think I tied this together Huh because because I don't have experiences like that I feel like that's why I can't open up because I don't want to I don't want to give boring answers Okay, okay Yeah, so You feel like the answers that you give when you open up aren't going to be good enough. They'll be boring No, i'm i'm being completely honest right now. Like i'm not trying to like I know you're being honest with me. I'm talking i'm talking about other people though Right because you say that like if I offer what's on the inside it's gonna feel bland to people Yes Right, so like i'm just noticing an interesting theme like sure I get that it's bland And i'm not I I know I I get the sense you're being authentic with me. I don't think you're trying to like, you know Hide I don't I genuinely don't think you're hiding but at the same time I do notice that there's sort of like a theme That like what you have to give isn't good enough Yeah, that could be a thing So then let me ask you this like so let's go let's go to the emotional moderation then So you you don't feel things quite as intensely as other people feel them Mm-hmm, and i'm very jealous of that. So like if people are like Super sad about something or like if someone's super ecstatic about something Like I see that i'm like I wish I had that Um And have you ever felt super sad or excited about something Super sad or excited about something I think I probably have but like in hindsight if I look back to it, I think I always like downplay it So like during the moment I was probably super excited but then like if I look back like two years later i'll be like oh It wasn't that good so I don't remember that feeling as Intensely as I probably had it when it happened So like if I try to look back right now Like I can't really recall Any specific moment to tell you Um, do you ever Let me just think about this. Okay. So june here's so I I know this may be like a little bit unsatisfying, but I'm gonna like toss out like a possibility. Okay. So have you ever heard of this term alexithymia? No So alexithymia is a condition in which you are not aware of what your internal emotions are So it's almost like you're colorblind to emotion So alexithymia is very common um in like three populations, so like You know a lot of like asians are alexithymic indians too Men and gamers so if you think about like the culture that you grew up in what was like Was there a lot of emotion expressed in your household growing up? No Did your parents tell you that they loved you? I think no Okay, I could see that I mean they are great parents. Yep, and I could feel the love but we never verbally said it and I think at when I was like around 17 I think I had a feeling where I was like, why is my family not like the ones I see in movies? Like the ones you see in movies are like saying oh, I love you and like doing like all this affection stuff but then I realized that Like part of the problem is not just my parents. It's also me. I was also afraid to say I love you Like I would say like I love you too Like girls like that I didn't even fucking care about when I was younger But then I was so scared to say that to my mom right, so I think starting from then I did start saying it to my mom and dad and then we are Pretty regularly saying that now What made you scared to say that to your mom and dad? It's embarrassing It was embarrassing at first what's embarrassing about it? Well I think growing up and not doing that kind of stuff and then all of a sudden doing it When you're an angsty teenager, I think that's pretty You're like gonna put in a Pretty vulnerable place I think And what place is that? What if I say that? What if I say that and then you know The response is like Oh, why are you saying that? Or whatever Mm-hmm And and i'm curious is is that So we're talking about vulnerability and how people may respond to it Um You know, but it sounds like you've never been in a situation where you have opened up to someone So it sounds like you were actually vulnerable with your parents like you went on the limb and you said I love you And they said I love you too. You're great, June Yes Yeah, so I feel like that's significant and relates to our conversation, but i'm not quite sure how what do you think? I think I think something's clicking I think um, just like Can't really expect other people to be vulnerable with me if I don't take the initiative To be vulnerable with them as well Sure, because that's like saying I love you to your mom or that's like, I don't know sharing like something emotional with your friends What would you share I don't know That's what i'm trying to figure out Yeah So I I feel like that's I feel like something clicked for me there, too I I don't know exactly what it is, but it certainly has the themes of vulnerability going out on a limb being accepted You know, and I think this is where when I when we talk about culture, so I think that like like so You know, jun it sounds like you're good at singing sounds like you're good at dancing sounds like you're good at basketball It sounds like you're really good at rust And so when it comes to understanding our emotions, that's a skill, too Right. So like we we can be just like you can train your palate Or train your eyesight or train your you know, your reflexes Your hand eye coordination Your ability to like get the ball in the basket. You can also train yourself to understand what you feel on the inside And there are a couple of different things that I think could be going on So i'm going to go like academic for a second and let's like forget Yeah, because because i'll ask you lots of questions about how you feel about stuff and you'll you generally give me umbrella terms So you'll say like uncomfortable or awkward But like what is awkward right so like usually awkwardness is an umbrella term that like Means something like fear of judgment for feeling guilty for making like destroying your friend group right, so when I think about like the actual emotions That people are feeling if you date someone in your friend group and then y'all break up There's actually a whole constellation of feelings there that we call awkward because we don't know how to Define what they are. Okay, I I got it now, right? So like let's just think through what people could be feeling the first is you guys go to a party And then like all of your friend group is there Or maybe even before the party starts. It's like people are texting each other And then you feel guilty because like people don't know like who to text It's supposed to be fun. But now that you and your girlfriend broke up the entire group like can't have fun anymore So maybe you feel guilty Yes, right, but it's like yeah, but it's weird because like you don't like we don't put words that or maybe you feel ashamed like maybe you feel like You know She has some friends in the friend group that are closer to her than closer to you And as she's crying every day like she's gonna make you look bad Because the friends are gonna think oh you're an asshole And so then like maybe you feel a little like that can create all kinds of feelings Maybe you feel a little bit shamed ashamed for hurting her maybe you feel a little bit like angry because She's talking shit about you and like since those are her friends better like they're gonna start thinking less of you and you don't deserve that Does that make sense that people could kind of feel that way Yeah, that makes a lot of sense because I for me I was like, oh awkward, okay that Encapsulates what I feel really well, but now that you like break it down I can see what you mean that right? so so and and then there's like there are even like all kinds of kinds of other layers like What if you're crushing a little bit on someone else in the friend group? And so like what's gonna happen there now that you broke up with this person? Or like what if one of your friends is crushing on her and now you broke up with her and now you've like that's complex It's very complex Yeah, I don't like that at all Okay, so now I hate conflict of any kind, okay So now we're getting somewhere So the first thing is like what do you hate about conflict? I just don't want to have any bad blood with anyone Why what's wrong all my interactions to be positive? Yeah, so that's why you're not gonna open up to anyone Maybe that's it Right, because you gotta like here's the thing like so here's the thing jun so when it comes to alexithymia What happens so this is what happens is like so culturally we're like taught to sort of suppress emotions So we don't like understand what they are. So we use these terms like awkward, right fine Secondly when you play a lot of video games like literally video games will shut off like I was just talking about this I can't believe it, but video games will shut off your amygdala Which is like the part of your brain that experiences emotions. Yeah Right, so like if he's absolutely right so like rust is like so so then what's happening is you've got like, you know Eight hours a day or whatever where you're like playing rust And so what you're doing is you're like switching off this emotional circuitry so it starts to get rusty And then on top of it, it sounds like you're a dude And so like generally speaking, especially like like culturally in most cultures That like, you know women will emotionally express things to each other in a platonic way But as men like, you know, like like it's weird. We use like the language of body Right. So like if I get like dumped by my girlfriend or if I break up with my girlfriend I'm not going to come to you and say Hey, jun, I feel really bad about myself And then you're gonna say like yeah, man sucks bro. And then i'm not gonna say like yeah I'm now afraid i'm now afraid that I will never be able to find love again And that there's something fundamentally broken in me because I couldn't make this relationship work That's so true Right what i'm gonna say you're gonna be like sucks bro, and i'm like, yeah, man And i'm gonna be like, yeah, it feels like she tore my nutsack off and you're like, yeah, man I know exactly what you're talking about Yeah, I see I see girls do that a lot like like being like super like open with each other and you know being like Very descriptive with the words and like, you know actually explaining their emotions. Well, I i'm really jealous of that Because like if I try to uh, like when you ask me about my emotions, like I had no idea what to say Yeah Yep. So so so I I think that like the first problem here is alexithymia Because when I point it out to you, right so like so even if we pay attention I don't know if this makes sense jun, but how are you feeling emotionally right now? Right now yeah So I i'm not actually i'm not even feels like it's getting more clear. Yes. Okay. So that's but that's not an emotion Oh, man, that's an emotion. Yeah. Yeah, no, it's okay. It's okay. Don't get frustrated So like what is what is the energy of the conversation now? What's the energy it's a little bit more Comfortable. Yep, right. So like there's a change in the tone of your voice You're laughing Right whereas like before it clicked yeah before it's like, hmm Because I couldn't really think of like what to say, right? So so what's happening how to describe what I was thinking Totally fine. So like as we get closer to the truth Some kind of emotion is going to come up And like it doesn't matter what it is It's like and what we're hearing you do is laughing like I can hear the animation in your voice And there's the hmm I Can't help it. Yeah, that's why you don't need to help it like we're here to help it right? It's totally fine. You do you baby so So like and that's where like okay So because now as I as I explain these emotions to you like, you know, I I know this sounds kind of weird june I'm sometimes I say things that sound so basic they sound idiotic But when I point these possibilities out to you, you understand exactly Right, so like but you can't understand when I point it out unless on some level, you know If you truly did not feel those things and I said, oh like maybe this person is feeling this You'd be like scratching your head and you'll be like Yeah, I can sort of see that. Does that make sense? Yeah But you're like yes. Yes I can I can understand all those things i'm conflict avoidant like you call it conflict avoidant because that's what it looks like from the outside or that's the surface level way that you describe it. But really what it is, is like, I can't tolerate people disliking me. Right? And so if we think about, you know, why can't you tolerate people disliking you? Like, there's an emotion there that could be fear. I'm afraid I can't. I can't tolerate people that I like, disliking me. Yeah, okay. That's what scares me. If someone random internet stranger didn't like me, I wouldn't care at all. Absolutely. So now my family or my friends or let's say like my community, then I'll be like, oh, there must be something I did wrong. And that would bother me a lot. So now we get to, so there's origins to that. But before we go there, like now we get to the vulnerability. So anytime you have a surface level relationship with someone, and you be vulnerable with them, what are the possible outcomes of that vulnerability? You wouldn't talk to them anymore? Possibly, right? It either strengthens the relationship or shatters the relationship. Yeah. And so like, I can sort of see like why you may feel like, I imagine that you almost feel paralyzed in these relationships. Like you're kind of stuck at the surface level. And I think if you really look into that, one of the possibilities is that like, you don't know how to make sure that when you vulnerably express something, that it's going to advance the relationship forward. Yeah, I have no clue. You don't know how to say something that won't make things awkward. Not awkward. I can, I can. So it's not, I can't, I can't talk about like personal stuff without making it awkward. That's what I mean. So, so you don't know, like you can talk about surface level stuff, but like it's your avoidance. Like you don't want to make things awkward, right? June, like scale of one to 10 with friends of yours, 10 being is absolutely terrible. One being is no big deal. How much do you want to avoid awkwardness? So there we are. I did not want any awkwardness. Right. So like, and now this is like the crux of it, because if you're like, you don't know how to be vulnerable with someone without making it awkward. And so you're avoiding awkwardness at all costs. The air go like you can't be vulnerable with anyone. And so the challenge here is it comes down to control, June, like the whole point about advancing a relationship. I know this sounds weird and it's going to sound terrifying. And if you're trying to figure out how you feel when I'm about to say what I'm going to say, the answer is terror. When you are vulnerable with someone, you are opening the door to awkwardness. You are ceding control of the relationship and it could rupture. How does that make you feel? Very afraid. There it is. And so now we see why you can't open up, because that's the whole point about vulnerability, right? It's like, I'm going to let like vulnerability is like, like literally the word like vulnerability is like, like literally the word means I'm going to let give you the opportunity to hurt me. And right now you control your fucking charismatic guy, aren't you, June? You're so good at making friends. You are so good at getting people to like you. You can show this shell to people and you can like, man, everyone when they meet June within 15 minutes, look at this Chad. Okay. I think I'm guessing dancer. No, no, no. Listen, listen, listen. You're gassing me up a little bit too much. Right? No, but like, come on, bro. Like, tell me I'm wrong. Tell me if I, if I met you in real life, in 20 minutes, would I like you? Maybe. I think the answer is yes. Right? Look at fucking, look at how humble you are. I hope so. Like how, how down to earth is this guy? Right? Like he's not an arrogant prick. He's just like, so like, how is that not the perfect response? Like just think about it. Right. It's perfect. I hope you like me, man. Like I'm confident in myself and I hope you can appreciate that. But you don't say no, cause you don't have fucking low self-esteem and you don't say yes, because you're not an arrogant prick. It's so perfect. It's so fucking silky smooth, man. Like Teflon right here. WD-40. Oh man. Cause people do like you, right, Jun? I like the thing. So yeah. Yeah. It's still so humble. Right? Like you can state it without being arrogant. Like I think you're, you're probably charismatic. And like, now the problem though is that like that shell which you have, which makes people like you is something that you have to discard and you have to make like risk making things awkward if you want to advance the relationship. And like, you know, when it comes to girls, I don't know if like the reason that you, I mean, I'm assuming that you're heterosexual cause it sounded like you were talking about a girlfriend, but, you know, like, I mean, I don't know if it's like, because you've become a big YouTuber and streamer that you don't really have opportunities to engage in relationships or they're like, have been girls that you've been interested in and like something has kept you from like asking them out. Yeah. I've actually never asked someone out before. Okay. So like, here we go, baby. So like, when you think about asking someone out, what are you afraid of? Right? I'm like, it's like, The golden word is awkwardness. There it is. Right? There it is again. And so like what, but awkward's not a thing. Right. It's just like, it's like, It's not a thing. It's yeah, it's an umbrella term. Like I get that it makes things awkward, but like, what is the awkwardness that you're trying to avoid? Is it like, oh, we're kind of friends right now and I don't want to screw that. Like what is like, it's there, June. Like don't like, you may not be able to find it, but like, I don't even know if we're going to find it today, but it's there. Right? What, like when you, I guess I'm going to have to guess because I don't know if you can find it, but like, so there's this girl, like, so tell me about it. Like, can you, do you feel okay talking about a girl or is that too awkward? Yeah. No, I can talk. I can talk. So like, talk to me about a girl that you liked. Okay. I think there was only like two girls that I actually seriously liked. And it's mostly people that were what I was super interested at the time. And they were what I considered like, like the most passionate about it. I think, I think passion is a big thing. So like passion is a big turn on for you. Yes. So one of them was like a martial art, right? And they would always like work super hard. So like, I would first get that attention and then it's like, add me to the party. And then I would get that attention. And then it's like admiration. Oh, wow. This person's working so hard. Like I'll work as hard as them. And then it turns into infatuation. So it sounds like, what do you mean by infatuation? Well, you admire them as people first and then, and then you start liking them. Okay. And so, and so like, what did you want to like, and that you thought about asking her out? Um, the first girl actually did like me back. But then, I don't know, I just like, it was kind of gone. The second girl was like in dance. And it was like the same thing. Like she was like super good at dance. And I was like, wow. Like she was super passionate about it. And then I liked her like as a person. And as like a dancer. And then I wanted to be, I wanted to be like them. And then I started liking them afterwards. And then what happened? The two are kind of different because the first one, I kind of did say, wait, I didn't really ask her out, but we kind of figured out that we liked each other. But then it kind of fizzled out. So I don't really have much to say about that. What do you mean by it kind of fizzled out? I think I just lost interest. Okay. So Jun, I want to just like point out to you what I'm seeing. Okay. Like, let me know if you feel judged, but like, I'm seeing like blind spots in this conversation. Right. So it's like, you can trust me. I do too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it seems really weird, but that's just how it was. Yeah. Yeah. No, I understand. So I think what we've got to do is like increase your like ability to detect. Right? So like, like, here's this girl, you're infatuated with her, you respect her as a human being, like, how are you not just like the perfect boyfriend Jun? But you respect her as a human first. And then like you like you, you like her, you guys like each other, and then it fizzles out. It's like that sounds like the- I just like lost interest. Okay. Maybe it was because like, if I really try to think about it, I think because I saw her in like such a positive light at first, like once I got to know her, maybe she wasn't what I expected. And then it fizzled out. Is that the case? I think that was the case for the first one. Okay. What about the second one? The second one, I never really made a move. What kept you from making a move? Probably just insecurity. What does that mean? Because I like regarded her so highly, I just didn't think that I'll be good enough. I'm sorry, have we talked about that before? You not being good enough? Yes. Right? So now it's interesting because like, you know, were you afraid that things would get awkward if you asked her out? Yeah, because I enjoyed her company like, even without dating. But then if I cross that line, cross that line, that would be gone too. Yep. So that's the thing, right? So like, remember, like, so this is why I think your relationship state, okay, so June, this is tying together for me now, okay? May not tie together for you, but it seemed like we're kind of hitting these same notes, like over and over and over again. I don't know if it's because I'm making like, I'm drawing a constellation out of stars, and there really isn't like a horse in the sky. It's just stars. It's all over the place. There's no image of my constellation. So maybe it's just me overinterpreting, because that's a bias of people in my profession, is we like to come, we like to listen to human beings and reduce them to simple patterns that we can divine out of our psychiatric brilliance. So I could be falling into that trap. But I really don't think so. So here's what I'm hearing from you. Okay, so the first thing is that like, you like this person. And then like, the problem is that like, at some point to advance the relationship, you've got to take a risk. Right? Like, and this is where like stuff comes together. So there's this girl, she's in dance, like you respect her, because she puts in the work, like you put in the work. It's something that you pride very heavily about yourself. You may not be the smartest kid in the bunch. You may not be the gold medalist, but goddamn it, you're going to at least get a bronze because like, you can progress like you can put in the work and you can put in the time. And here she is, she's into dance, she's probably in shape. She's relatively hot. And then like, you know, so you're like, you're into her. And you guys are friends, because you're charismatic, and you're a likable guy. And then probably what happened is like a couple of things, maybe you felt her out a little bit, right? Like, you kind of put out some signals like, hey, but like, you never were too transparent about it. Because like you said, with the first girl, like, you're pretty good at like sussing things out. But you're never going to ask directly, you're never going to make anything awkward, right? You're never going to put her in the place of like, hey, I'm really into you. Like, are you interested in going out? Because oh my god, that would be so awkward. What if she says no. And so now the problem is that like, there's this is where things really start to like, come together in this terrible storm. Because if you're insecure about yourself, that makes it even harder for you to risk if you are secure. If you were good enough, then you'd be okay rolling the dice. Because then it's I know it sounds weird, June, but it's not even rolling the dice at that point, right? Like the risk is low, the more confident you are in yourself. Yeah. And so you strive for progress. And you strive to be the gold medalist. Because if you're the gold medalist, then you can roll the dice and it won't matter. Because you're so good, like you you know that people will accept you. Even though that's not true. Like I know it's not true. You know it's not true. But it's like this kind of like clicks together in this weird way, because you're always striving to be better, always striving to be better, always striving to be better. And then one day, if you're good enough, then you can ask someone out and then there's no risk. Does that make sense? Yeah. But now the problem is that like, even with your relationships, the very nature of asking someone out is that it is a risk, the very nature of deepening a relationship is that it involves vulnerability. Yeah. And you try so hard to control your relationships, to keep them perfect. You don't want anyone that you care about to dislike you at all. And that's sort of like, it's kind of like, bro, if I'm like never willing to get into the ring and take a couple of punches, like I'm never going to be able to play the game. You know, like, I mean, it sounded like you played League of Legends. I'm not too familiar with Rust. I mean, I know it's like a cooperative survival MMO kind of thing, right? Let's look at the common ground as League of Legends. I played that game a lot. So it's like, it's like, if I'm afraid of losing and I never queue up from League, like, that's what I hear you saying to me. That like, I don't know how to queue up for a game of League because you're so terrified about like losing. And it's like, it's just part of the game. Yeah, that actually gave me a lot of insight. What you just said, because I actually never thought about it, but I do. I do wait until everything's perfect. If I want to do something big, then I wait until it's perfect because I hate risk. Yeah. Right. And this is the thing. So like risk tolerance ties to confidence. Because if we think about what confident is, confidence is the ability to face uncertainty. And the more that you stack the deck in your favor before you act, June, what happens to your confidence? If I stack the deck in my favor and then I act, am I more confident afterward? No, probably not. The exact opposite. It reinforces my insecurity. Because it's not me that did it. It's all of these other things that made sure that it worked out. Yeah, you did meticulous planning. Yes. And so like now I'm going to give you just an analogy for medicine. Okay. So can I share a story about myself? Oh, yes. Okay. I love that. So like I finished medical school and then everyone called me a doctor. But I know this sounds kind of weird, but when you finish medical school, like you're not really a doctor. You know, does that make sense? Like you just get your MD. It's like with the day before medical school, you don't have your MD degree. And then you walk down the stage and someone hands you a piece of paper and then like magically you're a doctor. You're not a doctor. You're just like one day you're a fourth year medical student. You're not a full fledged doctor. Sure. Technically you're a doctor. But does that make sense? That makes sense. And so like, I still remember the day that I became a doctor. I was at a wedding and then someone was like, is there a doctor here? And I was like, oh shit. Because normally you're not a doctor. I was like, oh shit. Because normally like when you, yeah. So like normally like I'm so then you start residency, okay, which is like where you really learn how to be a doctor. So you go to the hospital and then you're taking care of patients. But you have like supervisors who are above you. So I'm there at the hospital. I'm taking care of patients, but I have a senior resident. I have an attending physician. So there's a dude with 20 years of experience. There's a dude with three years of experience. There's a dude who's one year ahead of me. And this is my team. I'm the bottom on the totem pole, but there are three people looking over my shoulder all the time. We're like butt buddies, like the buddy system. Oh, right. So they're kind of where you're going with this. And so then you want me to finish or you want to? Yeah, let me finish. No, no, no, go ahead. Go ahead. So like here I am at the wedding and it's like, oh crap. And I'm like waiting for someone else to say, you know, I'm, but there's like, it's bizarre. My mom is a doctor. So my mom fucking, my mom volunteers me. She's a doctor. She's been practicing for 30 years. And then she's like, oh yeah, like my son is a doctor. I said, what? You're like, I've been doing this for six months. You've been doing this for 30 years. And then she like points at me. I still remember she points at me. We're in this big hall with like 400 tables, sorry, 400 people, like 50 tables. And then she points at me. And then I see like people walking over and I'm like, what? And then they're like, oh, like your mom said you're a doctor. And I was like, yes, that is true. And then we walk outside of the hall and there's like this 70 year old lady who's like laying down on a couch. And I'm like, oh shit. And my mom is there. I don't think she realizes what she had done. And then, and then so they're like, you know, oh, like she's feeling lightheaded. This is my lights, like the bride of the, I mean, the grandmother or the bride. And she's like, my grandma's like lightheaded. And I'm like, oh shit. Is she having a heart attack? Is she having a stroke? Is she, you know, so then I'm like, okay, well, and then like your training kicks in. There's no senior residents, no attendings. And my mom has abandoned me, which is, you know, if I ever talk to a psychiatrist on stream, we can talk about that. But so there I am. And it's like, okay, so I talked to her, you know, I'm like, okay, what do I do? Like, okay, I check her blood pressure, you know, ask her a couple of questions. Like I do a neurological exam. I'm like, okay, blink and then do this and look to the right and look to the left, swallow, smell my fingers. I know it sounds weird, but something that you do, you know, try to smell this thing and like, okay, like, can you, can you wiggle your fingers, wiggle your toes? Okay. You know, are you having any chest pain? And then I look at her and she doesn't seem that sick, right? Like, I know this sounds weird, but like even you, June, like, you know, you see some people sometimes and you're like, that person is sick. And then other people are like, oh, like that person isn't that sick. She doesn't look sick. And I'm like, yeah, it sounds like maybe you're dehydrated. Have you like had any water today? And she's like, yeah, I had a little bit. And I was like, why don't you have some water? I'm going to sit here with you. I don't think we need to call 911 yet, but I'm going to sit here with you for 15 minutes. Like it gets you some food, get you some water. She's feeling better. Okay, let's like, it's fine. No one needs to go to the hospital. Okay. And it's like, holy shit, I'm a doctor. You're a doctor. And so like, where does that confidence come from? There's no attendings. It's just me and grandmother of the bride. And the problem is that like, you're good at rust, right, June? And when you start on a rust server, who's got your back? Who's got my back? Yeah. My teammates. Okay. Right. But there are other teams. And so like, yeah, like, like, sure, your teammates have your back. But like, even when you go into a game of League of Legends, like even if the team game, it's you, right? Like, it's not like, it's not like, you know, riot games is like sitting there, like recoding things to make your hero overpowered, which is exactly what you do in real life is you try to like, you know, open up dev tools and structure your life so that you never have to take risks. And then the more that you do that, like the harder it becomes to open up because you want to avoid that awkwardness at all costs. And like, I don't know how to say this, bro, but like, if you're never willing to, you know, make things awkward, it's going to be really hard to ask a girl out. But you have your plan, June. And you know what your plan is? Your plan is to wait until you're 100% sure that she likes you. And she's going to say yes, and then you will ask her out. You're going to ask your friends, you're going to ask her friends, and you're going to make sure that everything's okay. That would make things too awkward. I know what you mean. But you got to be sure before you take your shot. And as long as that's the case, bro, you're going to be like stuck at this level. That was a really good story. Because I think it relates. Because like, even if you even if you didn't think you were a doctor at the time, because you were like six months in, and there was like all these other people that have way more experience than you, you were still a doctor. And then once you're like, put into that position, you're able to do it anyways. Even though you didn't think you were a doctor at first. Yep. So here's the thing, June. Did I think I was good enough? No, but you did it anyways. Was I good enough? Yes. Yes. Did you get an 86? Or did you get a 95? I got a 95. And what did you think you deserved? 100. See, I'm getting close to something. You can deflect with humor if you want to. Because here's the thing, June, you are good enough. You've been good enough. You deserve the 95 then. Your parents have loved you since the day you were born. And those chicks were totally into you. You don't need to be any better than what you are right now. You're you're golden, bro. Like, should you continue to grow as a human being? Absolutely. But you're good enough. Thank you. I think right now, I am trying to be like, opening up more, like I'm like, talking to people more, like initiating more friendships, because I never used to do that. Honestly, like even last year, I didn't really do that. But then like this year, I'm really trying to do that. I think in terms of like dating, I'm not I'm not too worried. Back then, I didn't have a lot of confidence. I think I grew like over the last five years, I did grow a little bit more confidence. I think right now, the only issue is, I'm just not able to even have the first step where I have a girl that I like. Because, like, because of COVID, basically. Yeah. So if that's the case, like, that's why, you know, this is this is why we're going to have this conversation now. And like, hopefully, people will get vaccinated. Turns out people may need a third booster. But I think you'll get there. But I think the main thing, June, is you've got to stop running away from awkwardness. Right. And that's where like, like, like, overcoming awkwardness is not going to happen as long as you don't know what it is. And so the next step is going to be like, unpacking what is awkwardness in a given situation. Right. So like, if you think about someone who you want to deepen a relationship with, what are you saying that would make things awkward? And like, what is the awkward? Is it fear? Is it guilt? Is it shame? You know, like, I will send you something called the feelings wheel. And if you have like a friend or therapist or something like that, that you can work with, that'd be awesome. Like, we're going to send you the feelings wheel, like you're going to just circle the feelings. OK, oh, it looks like someone is fog. OK, so let me forward this to you. Oh, you actually have the feeling wheel? Yeah, one of our copy image. So I will just. OK, so yeah, can you take a look at that? Oh, my God. OK, this is so big. Yes. Hold on, chat. Let me let me open. There's like there's like 100 words here. Yes. Wow. This is like beyond my vocabulary. Well, yeah. So like we're going to we're going to progress June because that's something you're good at. Right. So like this is the feelings wheel. So when we talk about awkward, you know, it's going to be feeling rejected, feeling excluded in that group after you break up with the girlfriend, feeling inadequate, feeling anxious, feeling bitter, feeling humiliated, feeling resentful for your friends for siding with her instead of siding with you, feeling overwhelmed, out of control, pressured to ask her out quickly or be nice or fix your problems. You know, you know, I really think just like just being a streamer, like really made me worse in being descriptive because what ends up happening, Dr. K, I don't know if you've already reached this point in streaming where you just like say everything as Keck W. Yeah, yeah. You know, it's interesting, right? Because I think that like, like, you know, when I was talking about how men describe, you know, feelings in physical ways, I think actually one of the things that's really cool is that we do have our own vocabulary. Right. And it's just not mine right now is sad. Yeah. But but so that's the thing, right? Is if you really look at it, like the reason that there are so many different icons is because feels bad men and sad and Pepe Han. Pepe hands is different from Pepe crying. True. Right. Pepe with tears in his eyes is different from Pepe crying. And, and like, there's like feels bad men, and then there's sad and then there's feels sad, man. So it's almost like you could construct a feeling wheel with like all of the emotes. And that would work. Right? Like underneath sad, there's feels bad man, and then there's feels sad, man. And then there's Pepe with tears in his eyes, and then there's Pepe crying. Like you could do this. So I think it's interesting that you say everything is Keck W. I don't think everything is Keck. I don't even know what Keck W means. But, but, but like, you know, I definitely think we're developing our own vocabulary. Yeah, honestly, yeah. And even like, you know, the fish, like, I love the fish, you know, the fish emote. The fish emote? You mean, what was it called? Which one? It's the one with the, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. So there's, there's ooh, and there's pog, and there's pog champ. So like in the pog wedge of the feeling wheel, there's poggers, pog champ, you know, I don't know what the other ones are. Yeah, it's becoming a real problem, actually, like twitch talk. Like even even sheesh. Do you know sheesh? No. Is that a person or a thing? Okay, I'll do it once for you. Okay. Are you ready? Yeah. Is that a mating call? Or what? What is that? You know, it could be very well be like a mating call, because actually, I have a story from today. I went to the gym, and I was done working out. And I went to the locker room, right? I was just showering. And then a bunch of dudes came in, right? And they were like changing. And I overheard the conversation. I may not be ready for this. No, no, one guy, one guy was like, yo, I've been like doing intermittent fasting. I was like, and another guy was like, Oh, what for? And then the other guy was like, yeah, I'm cutting right now. And the other guy said, sheesh. And then I actually had, like, I was like in the shower room. And I had like my first instinct when I heard that was to sheesh with that guy. It's actually becoming a problem. Wait, so why didn't you though? Because it would make things awkward. Yeah, but that's like, actually, I'm sorry. Go for it, June. Next time I'll sheesh with them. Yes. Okay. Yes. You got to put yourself out there. Right. You got to like let that pogchamp within you out. Right. Like the, the, you know, the scared. It's okay to be scared. It's okay to be scared. But don't let that stop you. Next time I will, I will sheesh from the shower room. Yeah. Sheesh, sheesh from the shower. That's, that's, that's my concrete advice to you at the end of the conversation. So I don't know what you were planning on getting from this, but what we're going to end up with is sheeshing from the shower room. I'm going to sheesh from the shower room next time. Thank you very much. Cool. Any questions, June? I mean, because I do feel like we're at sort of like a good stopping point, but I don't know if, I don't know how you feel about that or? No, I think this is really good. Honestly, I really love talking with like super intelligent people like you, because I think it gives me a lot of insights. I like at the beginning of our conversation, honestly, I didn't even know what to say, because I wasn't really sure how to describe anything. But then I feel like I got a lot of insight. Yeah. Gave me a lot of hope. So I appreciate your positive sentiment and your, your gratitude for the conversation. And I still feel like I got to bounce that back a little bit and remind you that it takes two to tango. So I know that you appreciate, I just drive this point home, which is like, what is your contribution to the conversation? Because what I'm hearing is you call me super intelligent and you being ignorant. No, no, no, no, no, no, I just know that that was not like, okay. Right? Because you said, but I just want to reflect back to you that I enjoy these conversations too, June, and it's because I recognize that there may be some things that you don't understand, but I think you actually did an amazing job. Because the problem is that like, I swim in these waters all the time. It's my day job. Whereas like we're queuing up, right? And like, this is like, I grind every single day and like we're queuing up together and, and you're, you know, you're holding your own in lane. Like that's the way we win. Right? So I think it's really awesome. Like I think this conversation is a good example of like, you know, you putting yourself out there feeling awkward, I'm sure. And then really, like, I, I'm really like, I'm, I think you did a fantastic job. Thank you. Cool. Do you sometimes I teach people how to meditate? Do you? Oh, I should love meditating, but I haven't done in a while. Okay, coincidentally, ever since I started Rust, like, can I tell you a story about like the first time I tried meditating? Yes, please. So I think I was like 13. And I was just like laying down in my bed. And then on my YouTube recommendations, I got a this guided meditation thing. And this guy had like a super deep voice. And I was like, Oh my God. So I like put my earphones on. And then I did this guided meditation thing. And then I was like listening to this guy's like beautiful voice. And he puts me into like a stance. And then I literally felt like I was in the middle of space. It was like super cool, but I haven't been able to replicate it since no matter how hard I tried. Okay. So you you felt this as a sensation of vastness? Yeah, I was just like floating in like, middle of nothing. Yeah, okay. So are you sitting up or what right now? I can I can I can lay down on my chair. Let me just think about how to teach this to you. So this is going to be a little bit more of a of an advanced technique, but it's actually relatively simple. Your back should be straight. And if you've done this lying down, I think you can try doing it lying down again. I think this is going to take practice. I don't know if it's going to work right now, because I think that you need a certain degree of like calmness. And I think actually like we're energized right now is what I'm feeling June. But I'm happy to share the technique with you that you can try to practice. And I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. So the technique is very simple. And we can kind of try to do it together. So you can lay down if you want to, but I'm going to go ahead and sit up straight. The main thing for meditation is that your back needs to be straight. So you can do that laying down standing up sitting up straight. Is there a reason for that? Yes. So what it's not there isn't a scientific reason. I'm sure there's a scientific reason. I don't know what the scientific reason is, I should say that. But in the sort of Eastern systems of like, you know, energy and chi and all that stuff, the energy of like spiritual growth is situated along your spine, lives at the base of your spine. And as that energy rises along the back of your spine, you start to have more spiritual experiences and spiritual growth. So there's no scientific correlate to this energy, like no one's been able to find it or detect it or anything like that. But essentially, like, apparently the spine, according to these theories, like the people who developed the practice of meditation, this is what they said, is that you want to facilitate, like it's like a pipe that, you know, water flows through and it starts at the bottom and then it works its way up. Does that answer your question enough for? Yeah, that's very interesting. So it's going to be kind of weird. But what I'm going to ask you to do, it's hard to demonstrate, I'm going to ask you to close your eyes. And then there's a point that's sort of like maybe right above your the middle of your eyebrows. I don't know if you can kind of tell it's like, not, you know, it's, it's maybe like a quarter inch or a few centimeters above the middle. Or you can kind of find it for some people, it feels a little bit higher. But what I want you to do is close your eyes. And then I want you to look at that point. So I know it sounds kind of weird, but and then you're gonna never done that. I think that's the first time I've ever done that in my life. So I want you to you can lay down or sit up straight. And then I want you to just look at that and just keep focusing on that point. As if you're trying to like look through it with your eyes, like imagine that your eyes are behind your forehead. It's hard to describe because these things are so experiential. But like imagine your eyes are behind your forehead and you're trying to look through like that point in your forehead is like a telescope. And so you're like looking through that point into something else. Does that make sense? Yep. Okay, so this may cause some amount of eye strain, which then you want to relax once it starts to feel uncomfortable. And then you want to resume again once your eyes have calmed down. You don't want to push yourself or hold it for a long period of time. But gradually over time, you want to build up the strength and focusing on that point. You may also learn that at some point, you can actually relax your eyes and focus on the point anyway, which is totally fine. Does that make sense? That makes sense. Okay, so let's try to practice for like three or four minutes. Okay, so you could try to hold it for maybe 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 30 seconds, relax for a little bit, hold again, relax, don't strain your eyes too much. Okay, so let's begin. Okay, so okay, go ahead and relax. Let your eyes remain closed. Go ahead and take a deep breath in and exhale slowly. You can go ahead and rub your eyes a little bit. Okay, then go ahead and open them. What was that like for you, Jen? I didn't get to the state I was talking about. But it is really relaxing. Okay. Yeah, so you could try practicing this. Did you feel like dizzy at all? No, but I did see the I did feel the eye strain that you're talking about. Yeah, sometimes like I'm like trying so hard to like look up. And then like naturally gradually goes down. So I have to like do it again. Yeah, so it may take a little bit of practice. You know, this may not be the right technique for you. I tend to find that some people will sometimes feel dizzy. And then I know it's not really this is gonna probably not gonna make any sense. But as the dizziness kind of like expands. This is a technique that I consistently hear from people when I teach it, that it gives them the feeling of what I call vastness, which is that they like that it kind of sounds kind of weird. Like you feel dizzy. And then it like kind of like, it sounds so bizarre, but it kind of like grows and grows. And then like a lot of people that I teach this technique will sort of share that experience with me. Yeah, that's kind of what I experienced back then. Yeah. So one thing I would say June is that one of the things that gets in the way of meditation, or experiences in meditation is seeking experiences in meditation. So when our mind is calm and tranquil, and we don't have expectation, then it can truly shut off and open ourselves up to whatever experience we can have. The challenge is that if you go into a practice seeking something, that very expectation will prevent your mind from relaxing. So I would say, you know, just do meditation without sort of thinking about that or try to let go of that expectation. Like learn to let go of your goal, which I think is also very healthy for you in general. But always finds a way to tie it together. Yeah. Maybe that's just me looking for every day. Do I meditate every day? I'm going to go with no. So I tend to have much more intensive periods of meditation, and then I do lots of different kinds of meditation. But I also think that like where I am in life right now, it is important for me to not meditate every day and just like let that go. You know, you have like a cheat day in terms of diet, or like you'll take a week off from going to the gym. So I think meditation is sort of the same way where I tend to meditate a fair amount, but I let go of the everyday thing a long time ago, where it's like, you know, that at this point feels a little bit artificial to me. So what I will do is like, embark on sprints essentially of meditation. And then I'll do a particular practice in depth for a particular amount of time. Do you ever like think about stuff while meditating? Or do you try to like keep your mind empty? You can't keep your mind empty, your mind has to naturally empty. And I'm usually pretty good at not thinking about things when I meditate, but that just comes with practice. So the way that meditation works, June, is you don't stop thinking about stuff. So you don't stop thinking about stuff. So your body and mind have a very simple principle of like tolerance to a constant stimuli. So if I put on my shirt first thing in the morning or after I shower, I'm going to feel the shirt on my body, right? And then the sensation of the shirt stops. Does that make sense? Yeah. And then if I concentrate on feeling the shirt, I will like my mind will stop feeling all other things. Does that make sense? That doesn't make too much sense. We're going to illustrate it really simply. I want you to do this with your hands. Okay. Now I want you to concentrate on the sensation of your hands. Can you feel your hands? Are you wearing a shirt? Yes. Now I want you to concentrate on the feeling of the shirt. As you focus on the shirt, what happens to the sensation of your hands? You forget about them. Absolutely. Right. So in the same way, our mind has lots of thoughts. And so what we do in meditation is we actually start with a focusing technique, like focusing on the breath. And when I put my attention on the breath, the breath knocks out all of the other thoughts, but we're still thinking about the breath. Does that make sense? Then what happens is eventually our mind stop acclimatizes to the sensation of the breath. And if we're lucky, we're left in a no mind state. Wow, that sounds awesome. Okay. I don't know. I don't know if I can get to that point. My mind races all the time. Sure. Sounds like you may not be good enough. I'll try it. Actually, I'll try for a week. There we go. Right. So it just takes practice, Jun. And sometimes if you like workout or dance, that may actually be like your avenue because like, you know, sometimes when you dance or you sing or you work out, you're like one with the practice. Does that make sense? Like you lose yourself in the dancing and all you are is like a dancing elemental. Like you become an elemental. And then you're like, you're like, you're like, a dancing elemental. Like you become an elemental, if that makes sense. Yeah. Like you're no longer June. You're just like someone who is dancing. So that can be a form of meditation. Yeah. So you've done it. So you may just be someone, it sounds like you're quite kinesthetic by nature. Kinesthetic meaning being like, you have a good like sense of your body. So what you may actually want to do is not sitting down meditation with something like yoga or Tai Chi may work way better for you. Like a very solid, like Hatha yoga. Have you ever done like hot yoga? No, I never tried hot yoga. So I would say, I would say like hot yoga is like a good thing for you to try. I mean, COVID aside, cause I don't know, that's probably awful with a mask on, but you know, I'd say in your case, I don't know that you need to sit and do like a quiet sitting meditation practice. You may be someone who just really gets that clear state of mind and that feels so good through physical, through a physical focus, as opposed to a breath focus or a mantra or something like that. I might try it. There's a lot of things that I used to have, like you used to do that gave me that satisfaction that I was talking about, but I stopped doing them for whatever reason. Sure. So, and I think if I do that more, pick it up again, should pick it up again. Yeah. Cool. You want to just tell us June where we can find you before we wrap up for the day? Where you can find me just on Twitch, usually nowadays, twitch.tv slash H June. You can follow me on Twitter. It's H7UNE. Cause someone has my H June account. It's like this middle old, middle aged, like nice lady that has the one H June. Outdone by the middle aged knife lady. All right, man. Well, thanks a lot. You know, it sounds like it was helpful. So I'm really happy to hear that. And good luck to you. And you know, thank you very much. I'm rooting for you, man. There's a part of me that wants to like, bro you up like a couple of weeks and out a couple of weeks from now and like push you to, you know, ask a girl out, but that's not really inappropriate. I'm going to be honest with you. Even if you ask me next year, I'll probably still be single. I know you say that, but that's, that's exactly why I feel like stepping out of my role is whatever the hell I am on Twitch and being like one of your bros and be like, come on, man, let's do this. No, it's actually awesome to see on Twitch. I think I watched a lot of your interviews before and I wasn't really sure how I would react. And at first, like, you could probably tell I was really like kind of uncomfortable. I wasn't really sure what to say, but then I think, I think I clicked at one point. Yeah, I certainly felt that way too. And it just, you know, take some time, man. Just takes time. Practice. Got to roll those dice, June. I will roll the dice. Awesome. The roll is not perfect. There you go. If you want to, you know, if you want to get snake and I guess snake eyes isn't bad, but you know, two sixes, you just got to roll the dice like over and over and over again. You'll get there. True. Like a hundred times. Yeah. Good luck, man. All right. Thank you very much, Dr. K. You're very welcome, H.U. Take care, buddy. Bye. All right, chat. Oh, man. I think, you know, like I said, it takes some time. People aren't really right. Like you got to, you got to find a way to the emotions, however they are.
