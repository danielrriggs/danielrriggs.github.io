 that becoming a good partner is not something that it's not like you're a finished product. It's not like you get made in the factory and then shipped out to be purchased as the perfect partner, right? And so like if you're like, oh, I'm not great, like I don't have a job. I don't, maybe I'm short. Maybe I'm not as physically attractive. Maybe I'm a little bit out of shape. Maybe I have an addiction that I'm dealing with or some kind of depression or maybe like, you know, there's something about me that's off. So I'm not a perfect product. This is the whole thing is that in dating, we think about people as finished products, right? This is I'm going to select this person to be my mate and they have to check all the boxes. We like, it's like going into a store and picking up a product that has been, you know, play tested and calibrated and refined, but that's not what human relationships are. I don't think you need to be perfect to start a relationship. In fact, I think it's that kind of thinking that screws people on both sides.
