 So if you want to change your personality, it turns out that you actually can. And the main thing that you need to focus on is instead of trying to fix your life, fix the way that you interpret and draw conclusions from life events. Because the real tragedy of life is that we spend a lot of energy trying to fix things that involve other people, which means fundamentally they're not completely, but at least partially out of our control. And then what we end up doing is we ignore all of the conclusions that we draw about ourselves. We don't think about it. We don't work on it. We don't craft the conclusions that we have about ourselves. And so those things develop automatically and then they determine our personality. And once they determine their person, your personality, then they'll determine the way that literally interactions get interpreted by your brain. They'll determine your emotional reactions to situations. They'll control the way that you behave. So if you want to forge a different destiny, you need to become a different person. The good news is that that's actually a lot easier or at least more possible than we realize.
