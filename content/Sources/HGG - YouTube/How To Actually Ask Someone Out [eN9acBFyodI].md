 If you want to ask someone out, you can ask them out, but I know this is absolutely insane. But if you have a friend and y'all are friends and you want to preserve the friendship, you have one card that you can play that none of the alpha red pillars can play because they're not friends with women. You get to have a friendly conversation. You get to say, hey, you are my friend. I value you as a friend. And I've noticed some feelings kind of arising up where I've started to think about you in like a slightly romantic way. I was hoping to have a conversation with you about this. You're going to approach it from as a friend. What should I do with these feelings? Help me figure out what should I do with these feelings? And you put the ball in their court. Let them know what's going on. Now, if someone wants to sever a friendship with you because of that, right? Like you can't really control that. They don't have a problem with you telling them that you have feelings. They have a problem with a confession, pressure, and guilt, which if you approach it as a friend, you can say, hey, these are feelings that we can talk about. What should I do with these feelings?
