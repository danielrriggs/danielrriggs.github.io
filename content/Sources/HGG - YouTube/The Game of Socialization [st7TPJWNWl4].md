 If you were never taught social skills, suddenly if you go out and you try to socialize and you literally don't know what to say, it's not because you're stupid, it's because like, hey, oh, you don't know how to play the game of socialization. Maybe that's because you never had the tutorial. It's like some of us are playing life as if we're playing the Elden Ring enemy randomizer, and we've never played a video game in our life. Like no, there's no tutorial. We're just dropped in. Because remember that life is more like the enemy randomizer. Like it's not crafted for us to do level one and then level two and level three level. It's not crafted for us to succeed like a video game. It's just RNG. And sometimes like the first person that you date is a level 100 narcissist. It's not like life gives you the level one narcissist first, so that you learn how to deal with them and then level two and then the level three and then the level four and the level five and then eventually you can deal with the level 100 narcissists. That's not how it works. It's like RNG. So you've got to like cut yourself some slack.
