 Oftentimes, the problem with shyness is not the shyness, it's the lack of confidence. So, someone who is not confident and shy will stay in the corner. Whereas someone who is confident and shy, like, I don't care to speak to or get to know people. It's not for me. And you guys may say, but that's weird, aren't you a psychiatrist? And like, don't you get to know people? I love to get to know people in that way. But I detest small talk. At a party, like, I don't want to hang out with any of these people. But if you're confident, you can. So then what ends up happening is I'd say that you need to work on your confidence and don't try to fix the shyness. It's a personality characteristic. You don't need to fix that. You need to fix the confidence. So it's not that you should be less shy. It is that you should have the control over yourself to where if you are put in a situation that requires interaction with other human beings, you can do so with full skill and effort. You should not be controlled by your shyness. And that usually involves confidence.
