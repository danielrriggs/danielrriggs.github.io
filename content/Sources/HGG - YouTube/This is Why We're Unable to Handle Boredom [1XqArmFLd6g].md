 How has technology affected our brains? What technology has done is make us it's almost like we're running around with like electric wheelchairs for our mind. And then like if you stop walking, and you start using an electric wheelchair, you're going to decondition your body for physical activity and walking, right? So what have we done? Our technology has deconditioned our mind to tolerate boredom. And just think about this for a second, right? Like, so when you're in the car, it's like when I'm cooking, it's podcast time, I'm going to be productive. This is the danger, right? So you'll see these websites where people will talk about Yeah, I read a bunch of books. And I like listen to a bunch of audio books and podcasts and stuff like that. I have entertainment time. And then like, you know, we're always doing something, our attention is always on something, we get bored very, very easily. And so like having everything at your fingertips on your phone is like terrible for your ability to tolerate boredom. And so what's happened is we've become unable to handle boredom. And as our mind gets weak at handling boredom, we like lose productivity, because then we get lost in these like apps and stuff.
