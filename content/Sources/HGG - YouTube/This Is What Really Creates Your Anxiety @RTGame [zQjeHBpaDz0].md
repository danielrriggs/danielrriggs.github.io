 If you look in the mind of an anxious person, the problem is that they think that since time is limited, I have to make the right choice. They think that their anxiety is tied to the fact that time is limited. But what they don't realize is that your attitude towards how limited time is can push you in two opposite directions. One is paralysis and one is sudden complete action. Time is limited in either case, but for some of us it cripples us. And for some of us it's like, f*** it, I might as well act today. Let's go, yeah, just the amount of action at that point, yeah. People think that their anxiety is determined by the fact that time is limited. But it's their attitude towards that that actually results in the anxiety. It's actually in your control, which is what a lot of people don't get. They think it's the other way around. They feel controlled by the fact that they don't have infinite time and they can't play every game on the universe and they can't do everything, right? Time is limited, oh my god. It's your attitude towards it that actually creates anxiety.
