 Here's why building study habits is hard. Y'all wanna understand this in a nutshell? Someone's asking, how do I build study habits? You know what to do. The reason is you're not motivated enough to actually do it because building study habits is an energy investment and you're not willing to pay the price. Why? Because why do you wanna study? Because I'm supposed to. Because I'm supposed to is not a good enough reason to beat this. So how does coaching help? Coaching helps because it helps you figure out a reason that is more important than this. That's what they're experts in. The problem in today's world is not that you need to be taught. There's an abundance of information. Everyone has the information. The problem isn't the information. And this is why it doesn't work because you can look at that crap over and over and over again. We know what we need to do, we just can't bring ourselves to do it. That's what we specialize in. So understand what drives you. It's not a lack of information problem. Maybe 500 years ago it was a lack of information problem. Now it's a driver problem.
