 When you start to believe something about yourself, it starts to shape what you choose to do or not do. So if I say something like, I am socially anxious, I am socially awkward, that belief in myself is going to prevent me from engaging in whatever that activity is. So I'm not going to go to parties because I'm socially anxious. And so the beliefs that you have about yourself start to shape your actions and determine your future. And what always happens with the beliefs that you have about yourself is they become self-fulfilling prophecies. If I believe I'm socially awkward, and I have all this evidence, by the way, Dr. K, it's not, you know, the reason you're saying that is because, like, bro, you don't know me. You don't know how socially awkward I am. I'm absolutely socially awkward. Okay, cool. So you're socially awkward. So then what? So you're not going to go to a party. And if you're not going to go to a party, then what? You're going to, your social skills will atrophy, and then you will become socially awkward. It's a vicious cycle in the wrong direction. The key thing to understand is these are all ego-based statements. They're statements of I am. And this may sound weird, but all that crap is BS. Because who you are is determined by your actions, right?
