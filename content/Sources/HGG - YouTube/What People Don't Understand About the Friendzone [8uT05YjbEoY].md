 It's not just about falling in love initially. It's about the way that as you engage with this person, what happens to your sensation of love. It intensifies. It builds up, builds up, builds up. And then we confess. No one who's in the friend zone has a casual conversation about being in love because those feelings have grown so much that they become overwhelming. I can't resist them anymore. And now I must confess my love. And then this other person is like blindsided by it. And then they reject you. And then you feel really hurt and you've invested six months and then you're damaged and your thoughts are disorganized and your sense of self is disturbed. Your self-esteem is in the pits. And then you spend six months recovering from that. And by the way, there's someone else on around month four, month five that starts to listen to your problems, right? They're like, oh my God, yeah, we're such good friends. And you confess to them how much this girl hurt you. And then they listen to you and you all cry together. And what does that do? What did we learn from the high altitude rickety bridge? Now you start to form romantic attachments with this person, but this person is your friend.
