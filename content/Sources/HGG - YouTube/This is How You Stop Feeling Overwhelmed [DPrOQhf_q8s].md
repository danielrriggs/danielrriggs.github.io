 If you're feeling overwhelmed, you don't actually need to fix the problems that make you feel overwhelmed. Because oftentimes those problems are completely out of your control. What you actually need to do is pick a completely different set of problems, but you need to pick it. And as you start to work on those, you'll see a cognitive shift because literally the equation in your mind is if active challenges outweigh passive challenges, I feel in control. But if passive challenges outweigh active challenges, then I feel overwhelmed and I'm unable to take action. So you don't need to conquer the feeling of overwhelmed at all, you just need to disarm it or unplug it by paradoxically taking on different challenges.
