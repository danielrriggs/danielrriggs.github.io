 So it starts by understanding your kid and like building an alliance with them. And then by all means set healthy limits, right? So the conversation with your kid is, I understand that it's hard. Do you want to go to college? Like you have to sit down with your kid and ask, like, do you want to go to college? What is it like? How do you think you're doing? The kid is like, I'm terrified because I know I'm not going to get into college. And then the right move for dad is like, you have to ask the kid, okay, I would like to help you if you want to go to college to help you get into college. Do you want my help? Are you afraid that even with my help, you won't be able to make it? I can understand that because I don't know if you're going to make it, but I'm willing to try if you want my help because the kid is taking the power. You guys got that? Dad is like trying to exert power in the relationship and kid is stealing it right back. Kid is going to win. Your kid is going to win any conflict between parent and child. The kid is going to win. That's what I've learned having two daughters, ages six and four, right? Even if the parent wins, the parent loses. So you have to support your kid, collaborate with your kid, build an alliance with your kid.
