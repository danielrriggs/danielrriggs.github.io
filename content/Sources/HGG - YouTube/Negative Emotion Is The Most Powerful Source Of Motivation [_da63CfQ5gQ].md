 Negative emotion is actually the most powerful source of motivation. And when we run away from it, when we fear it, when we suppress it, we're actually hamstringing ourselves in terms of our capacity to drive forward and get through other stuff. Because the other thing that we sometimes don't realize is that negative emotion is the best way to overcome other negative emotion. I'm socially anxious. What makes me finally leave the house? Being so lonely. Love and compassion is never going to conquer social anxiety. I mean, that's not true. It can't. But what will conquer anger is like, what will conquer fear is anger. And I don't think we really understand that a lot of people that I work with are stuck between two negative emotions, and they try to suppress everything instead of channeling one to overcome the other.
