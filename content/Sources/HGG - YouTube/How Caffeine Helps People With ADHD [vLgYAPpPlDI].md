 Why does tea or coffee calm me down emotionally when I have ADHD? This is super cool. So you look at ADHD, their minds are moving too fast. I get distracted. I'm thinking about this. I'm thinking about this. I'm hyperactive. I'm fidgeting, you know? And what is the medication that we tend to give people who are who have ADHD? Stimulants. Wait, but if they're moving too fast, why am I stimulating them? Or more importantly, what part of the brain am I stimulating? What I'm stimulating with people with ADHD is the breaks. I am hyper activating. The part of your brain that controls the other parts of your brain. This is why tea or coffee helps people with ADHD calm down. It hyper activates your frontal lobes, which then control or suppress your emotional circuitry. So it's kind of weird, but we actually want to hyper activate people with ADHD, not slow them down. We're going to strengthen the breaks.
