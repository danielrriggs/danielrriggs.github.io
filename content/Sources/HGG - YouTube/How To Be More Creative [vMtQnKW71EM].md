 When did creativity stop being in our control? When did we start treating creativity as different from anything else that we do? Oh, yeah, and other dimensions of my life, I can have a routine and I can have a habit. But when it comes to creativity, just going to send it out the window, incorrect. So the people who are successful artists are the ones who make a habit of creating. It's a skill to access that creative part of yourself. So this is where like, if you look at Mahali Shikset Mahali, right, the guy who developed flow, he's like talking about developing a process to access that creativity. Let me put it to you this way, like, so you can't create a state of sleep, you can't just be like, I'm asleep. No, can habit help with sleep? Absolutely. Even though you can't create it. In fact, it facilitates it. So when you develop a good creative habit, when you develop a good process, it primes your brain to like be in the right mode. And then once you're in the right mode, like the creativity actually flows more easily. The problem is that the reason you think creativity only flows at random times is because the way that you've allowed it to flow is only at random times.
