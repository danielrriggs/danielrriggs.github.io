 The decision to be independent and not rely on something, someone else's help is the height of privilege. I get to choose the terrifying thing and even after I had made that choice, it wrecked me for three days. Despite all of my resilience and all of my yogic training and all of my meditation, smack to the ground and I still had a safety net. I can only imagine what life is like if you do not have that safety net and you don't get to make the choice. You're just getting bodied left and right by your material circumstances. Security is the foundation of mental health. And so if you all are like struggling, like I hear it. And I think that like that's what's so challenging, right? Is everyone's like, oh, like work on your mental health. And it's like, yeah, and like you should do that. And that's really important. But like, let's be honest, going to see a therapist doesn't necessarily get you a place to live. It doesn't necessarily find you someone who loves you. It doesn't necessarily give you independence. It doesn't give you purpose. It helps. It's a great starting point. A lot of people who are starting from square zero.
