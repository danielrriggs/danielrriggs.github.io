 So think a little bit about what you actually want. Think about what your experience in the past has been when you force yourself to do stuff that you don't want to do. When you force yourself into making progress, chances are you're going to shoot yourself in the foot. Because real progress comes from some amount of forcing yourself, and I'm not saying that you all shouldn't do that. But it also comes from things like inspiration, right? There's a huge difference between seeking out a relationship because the loneliness is crushing. That's a relationship that could be doomed to failure because the relationship is giving you an emotion, is satisfying an emotional need. It's not about the relationship itself. You are getting something out of the relationship that a relationship is not supposed to provide. Versus falling in love, which is a completely different relationship. I'm with this person because I'm tired of being alone. Versus I'm with this person because I like this person. Huge difference. Definitely check out Dr. K's Guide to Mental Health.
