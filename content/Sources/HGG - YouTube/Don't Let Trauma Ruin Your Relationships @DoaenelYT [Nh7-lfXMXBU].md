 The only thing that I'm worried about is if you fall in love, don't cut that off because they made a mistake That's the one thing like give them a second chance And the reason I say give them a second chance is because I suspect that they may do something which because you actually mentalize You interpret it using your set of rules like talk to them You don't have to give them a second chance If you really love them like if you're in in love do yourself the favor of having a conversation and do your best to listen To them notice what kind of feelings you're having do not be controlled by your traumatic experiences Of cat fishing desire for protection this person hurt me I will never let them hurt hurt me again because that's why you cut them off. Yeah
