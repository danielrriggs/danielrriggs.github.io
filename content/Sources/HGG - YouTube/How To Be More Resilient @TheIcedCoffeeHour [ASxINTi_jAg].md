 anytime there is a negative event, if it is viewed on something called an intermixed time scale, people will respond better. If it is viewed as an end point, people will respond poorly. So it's exactly what we said between failure and setback. So in both cases, let's say I get an F on a test, some people will say that this is the end. And anytime the human mind has an end on some point, if that end is bad, then we feel really bad. It's hard to be resilient, we feel really depressed. If I end on a bad note, then the psychological impact is very damaging. When two human beings get an F on a test, one of them will view that F as the end. This is where my measurement stops. Another human being will view that F along something called an intermixed time scale, which means that they're actually looking at the F in the context of the next 30 tests. So when your view is more long term as opposed to this is the end, then you are going to be more resilient to setbacks.
