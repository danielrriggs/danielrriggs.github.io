 I kind of think about suffering as anything. It's the gap. It's the gap. So, if you kind of think about, oh, I heard this anime was really epic. And so, then I sit down to watch it and I'm like, it's like pretty good, but it's not as epic as everyone is saying. So, if you sort of think about in that moment, there's discontent, right? You're like, eh, I'm a little bit disappointed. So, what is that disappointment? It's the gap between your expectations and your experience. And if you really look at like what is the source of any unhappiness, you'll always find a gap. And when I hear you kind of talk about fulfillment, what does it mean to be fulfilled? It means that there's an absence of a gap. There's no gap. It's full, right? So, whether it's a romantic relationship or whatever, like the relationship, even though it isn't perfect and there are problems, there's no gap. Does that kind of make sense? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That makes total sense.
