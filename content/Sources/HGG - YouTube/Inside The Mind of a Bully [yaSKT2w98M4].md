 Kids who are in abusive households start to bully other kids. So I'm pissed at home because my parents are treating me like crap, but I can't do anything about that. If I start talking back to them, the abuse is going to increase, the toxicity is going to increase. So where can I safely express anger? I can't express it to adults, right? I can't get mad at teachers because teachers will punish me. But what I can do, what is the safest expression of anger, is I can find the smallest kid in class, the least threatening kid, and I can start to bully him. And what we sort of see in adults and prisoners of war is that they will oftentimes displace that anger in safe places. And what does it mean to safely displace anger or safely express that anger? That means that you can express anger sort of as much as you want, and there's a never-ending outlet for your anger, and that there's no consequence to expressing the anger. So when I express anger, I don't get punished in some way.
