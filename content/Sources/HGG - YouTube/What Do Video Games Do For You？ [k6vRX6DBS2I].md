 What do video games do? They cause us to dissociate, right? That's like, that's the problem. Is they cause us to forget life and push away all of our cares and worries and problems. And as long as I'm playing Dota or League of Legends or Valorant or whatever, like I'm not worrying about any of my stuff. So like no big deal. So this is one of the situations in which video games can truly be therapeutic because they assist in the dissociative process. And this is where people ask, are video games healthy or not healthy? No such thing. Every tool has a place. Is a hammer a good tool or a bad tool? It's a hammer. If you use it improperly, you're going to break a finger, but used in the right way. It can be very helpful. Video games are exactly the same. So oddly enough, I would encourage people to like follow what your mind tells you to do. If you want to veg out and play a video game, you just want to play Terraria for like eight hours after a traumatic event. I'd say go for it. Let your mind do what it needs to. It's going to be subconsciously processing stuff and that's actually okay. So what should you do after a traumatic event? Play a video game. There's actually data to support that.
