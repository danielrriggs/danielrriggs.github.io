 So if we look at doing therapy with people who are traumatized, what we sort of discover is that if someone has been traumatized, like let's say they were abused, they carry that trauma within them. And what we know clinically is if we can get them to vent that trauma, the energy within diminishes. So as someone goes to psychotherapy and as they talk about their trauma, essentially there's stuff that's stored in here which gets vented out. And as we vent our negative emotions, as we talk about that trauma, as we're honest and authentic, as our therapist creates a non-judgmental space where they're compassionate with us and we can share our shame and our negative emotions, what starts to happen to the traumatic individuals? That shame and that negativity that used to control their life stops controlling their life. This is literally the evidence-based approach of psychotherapy. That what psychotherapy tries to do is take negativity within you and have you vocalize it externally. And when you vocalize it externally, the power of it diminishes.
