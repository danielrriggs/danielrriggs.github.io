 And so this is exactly what we're missing in today's world, because in today's world, we have a new way of avoiding shame, a way of avoiding shame that does not involve fixing the problem, and that is the internet, right? Because now, if I feel ashamed about something, I never have to go back to those people, right? If I feel mortified because I said penis instead of weenus at a grocery store, I can just go to a different grocery store, or I can use grocery delivery and I never have to interact with anyone. If I do something stupid in my class, it's really easy. I can just skip class and watch the videos, or I can even drop the class. So now what's happened is our society is structured in such a way where if we feel shame in a particular situation, we don't actually have to correct the behavior to avoid the shame. We can just avoid the situation entirely. This is exactly the problem that you run into if you don't know how to harness shame.
