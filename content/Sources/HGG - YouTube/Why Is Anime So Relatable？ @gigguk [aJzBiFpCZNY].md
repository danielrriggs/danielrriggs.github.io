 Why do you think it's easier for you to emotionally connect to anime? I think just because to me it feels like a safe space. When you're watching a fictional piece of work because it's fictional, it feels like there won't be any judgments or anything like that maybe. You know, like I said, I grew up in a culture where, you know, showing emotions was like not like kind of like frowned upon, maybe not frowned upon, but definitely not openly accepted as much as it is today. So I guess like fiction and anime in particular just became like my safe haven, just to be like, hey, this is the place where you can show emotions, you can feel emotions, and you don't have to feel guilty or worry about judgment from it. Why not? What makes that safe? Because it's not real, right? It's fiction. It sounds counterintuitive, but because it's not real, you can, to me, it felt more real than a lot of, you know, a lot of real life events. So it's a weird counterintuitive way that my emotions worked.
