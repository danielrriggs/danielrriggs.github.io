 Real challenge with weed before the age of 21 is when you use marijuana in a developing brain, it alters some of the way that your brain wires. So a lot of people wonder, for example, is marijuana a gateway drug? And the answer is probably yes. And the reason is not like, it's not like necessarily like a moralistic thing where like, oh my god, now that you use weed, you're a degenerate. What really happens is when you have a developing brain, and especially the dopaminergic circuitry, the reward circuitry of the brain, and when you add marijuana to the mix, it makes parts of your brain hyper sensitive to the benefits of other drugs. So the reward that you get from other substances actually gets enhanced, which makes you more vulnerable to addiction. So like that's just a good example of how like, yeah, marijuana is a gateway drug.
