 You want to know how to win that game with three instant lock duals? You can even win that game by locking dualists. The way you do it is bros, what is going on here? Three insta lock dualists. Do y'all want me to try to salvage this or should I insta lock dualists? And are we going to have the most epic victory of a team of full dualists? I've done that a few times. It's worked once. It was amazing when it worked the other times. Horrible. Yeah. And you can even say that 99% chance we lose, but if we win, it's going to be epic. What should we do? Do we go for glory or do we try to salvage what is a colossally bad start to a draft? Yeah. And even that attitude, that's stoicism. Life can send you whatever the f*** it wants, but like, I ain't going to let it control me. You can even lock dualists, but whether you lock dualists or not lock dualists, one of those can be stoic and one cannot be stoic. Are you behaving reactionally or are you acknowledging your emotions, setting an intention and then moving towards it?
