 I apologize, but I don't know that your son needs our program. I think maybe you need our program. And then the parent says, no, no, no, I don't need anything. I'm not the one with the problem. My son is the one with the problem. And we say, well, we beg to differ. We've done five or six research studies on this. And what we discovered is that if your son is having trouble with technology, you're probably the one who needs to learn particular skills. And this is the unfortunate truth is that parents are on the front line. You can't expect your 15 year old to regulate their video game addiction. You can't expect the game developer or the government or even pediatricians or teachers to solve the problem. And so what we've really discovered is that parents need new skills that they didn't need before. Because if you think about how do we learn how to be parents, we learn what our parents used with us. Well, when our parents were raising us, they didn't have to deal with technology addiction. This is a new thing. And what we're really discovering is that parents do need to learn a new set of skills to be effective in today's modern day and age.
