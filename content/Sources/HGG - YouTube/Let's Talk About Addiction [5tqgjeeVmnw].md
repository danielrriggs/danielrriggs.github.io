 If I'm alone in life sitting at home all day and have nothing to look forward to, it's way easier to get addicted to a substance or gambling or gaming or whatever. There's an internal emotional state, which we also know very strongly neuroscientific, and there's an excellent researcher named, I don't know how to pronounce this, V-O-L-K-O-W, Volkow, best researcher on this stuff, excellent neuroscience paper, about how a lack of awareness of your internal state predisposes you to addiction. And so if you look at the mechanisms through which meditation helps people with addiction is we learn how to become aware of our internal emotional state and we learn how to emotionally regulate ourselves. And once you have those two things, once you can regulate your state, you no longer are going to be as vulnerable to the addictive substance. So in a nutshell, it's trait and state. Part of the way that you were born, you were wired, some people are luckier, other people are unluckier when it comes to addiction specifically. And then some people are more vulnerable because of their circumstances or even how they're feeling moment to moment.
