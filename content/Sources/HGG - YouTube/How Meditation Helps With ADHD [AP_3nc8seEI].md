 If you've got ADHD, force yourself to focus on one thing. You will fail, but then bring yourself back to it. Bring yourself back to it. Bring yourself back to it. And the real thing that happens with ADHD is not strengthening your ability to focus on one thing. What actually gets strengthened is your ability to return from a distraction to your task. So right now what happens with ADHD, this is a tricky thing. When you get distracted, what is the cost? Once you open up TikTok or YouTube shorts or Instagram reels or whatever, 45 minutes disappear before you come back to your task. When you meditate and as you become an expert meditator, you may get distracted the same amount. The difference is that within five seconds you'll return. Think about that. Imagine if a distraction did not cost you as much. This is how meditation improves ADHD. It doesn't actually change the attentional, it does change the attentional fundamentals, but even without changing the attentional fundamentals, it reduces the price you pay for having ADHD. That's the real strategy.
