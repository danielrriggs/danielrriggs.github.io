 So if you drink caffeine every morning, like the first cup of caffeine that you ever have in your life is going to make you completely wired. And so what happens over time is if you drink caffeine every day is your body develops a tolerance to that caffeine. And then if you don't have caffeine, you feel really crappy. And even if you do have caffeine, it doesn't actually pep you up, it just makes you feel normal. You guys with me? What video games do is they release that constant stream of dopamine and then what the brain does is actually down-regulates the response of that dopamine. So if you talk to, if you really look at people who play video games like a lot, they actually don't have fun while they're playing a game. But it becomes something like caffeine where if they don't play the game, they just don't feel normal. The other thing that's really dangerous that it does is it actually makes people anhedonic, which means it makes people have difficulty finding pleasure from other activities. And so the reason for that is like, let's say you read a book. In a book, normally you can find it enjoyable. But if your dopamine circuits have been so down-regulated, because the intensity of dopamine release that you get, the intensity and consistency of dopamine release you get from a game is so high that it down-regulates your entire mesolimbic circuit, which means things that you would normally find enjoyable, gamers have more trouble finding enjoyable.
