 What we're gonna do is actually share with y'all our new community event in the month of September Our community event is connect the dots So connect the dots is a scavenger hunt that spans everywhere you can find HG So there are six phases six rewards the goal is for the community to work together to unlock clues Phase one the reward is gonna be a new stream emote. Then we move on to phase two with new merch phase three I guess gonna I'm gonna drink dress as a monk for stream Interesting phase four. I'm gonna take bad mental health quizzes phase five We're gonna do monk stories and phase six is gonna be a cooking stream Okay, if you'll like the ASMR wait for the cooking So hints will be dropped during events to help people along in the scavenger hunt hints won't be recorded So people need to be there or make sure someone is participating So ask a coach in social sandbox y'all will get hints there and check the discord for a detailed schedule So connect the dots also involves weekly challenges So each each week we're gonna have a unique challenge The challenge will be one task but a large group of people need to complete the task in order to win the challenge Things like cleaning meditating journaling, etc. Okay, I hate to break it to y'all But once again, you have to do something good for yourself and put together your life to do this challenge The last thing is that this is a community challenge. So the point is to collaborate So the goal is not to figure this out all on your own But to work together with a commute with the community to try to figure it out together so you can join us on discord and explore healthy gamer dot GG slash connect the dots
