 So if you've got ADHD, the goal that you set for yourself is not, I want to be able to do what the other people do. It's not about duplicating their actions. It's about how can I achieve what they achieve using my brain? The goal of meditation is to achieve a particular state of mind. So with ADHD, you want to get to that state of mind. However the hell you do it is up to you. You don't even need to sit still. So when I have patients with ADHD, I'll teach them body mind practices. So stand up on one foot for as long as you can. You have to focus with a hundred percent of your being. Otherwise you're going to fall over. And then they focus for three minutes, four minutes, five minutes. Then they enter the trance. And who the hell cares whether you're using a mala or you have this incense or you're doing this branded meditation. Your eyes are open. Your eyes are closed. You're wearing fancy yoga pants that you bought for $200 or you're wearing nothing at all. Doesn't matter. The rest of it is all crap. The question is what state of mind do you achieve? Is walking naked meditation something you recommend in public? No, it is not.
