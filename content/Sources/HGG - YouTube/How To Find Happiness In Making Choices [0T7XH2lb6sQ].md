 See, we think that making the right choice creates the right result, but it's not the choice that creates the result. It's what you do after the choice. So I'll see this a lot also, like in medical school, where people are like, okay, well, I love surgery and I love psychiatry. Which one should I pick? Which one will make me happier? And that's where I think people are losing the point. They're like thinking, like, if I pick something, it'll make me happy. And that's why those people wind up unhappy, because they think that the happiness comes from the choice. It's created afterward. And as long as you think that a particular thing is going to make you happy, strive for that thing, and then you get it. And then what happens? Those people aren't happy. You'll get that. This is why people who look for happiness outside of themselves never find it, because they think that happiness is just like something that you acquire, right? It's like you open a treasure chest and boop, here's the happiness. I found it. Now I'm good. It doesn't work like that. It's created. This is why the research on savoring is so important. What we discover is that prioritizing experiences and learning how to savor is actually what leads to happiness.
