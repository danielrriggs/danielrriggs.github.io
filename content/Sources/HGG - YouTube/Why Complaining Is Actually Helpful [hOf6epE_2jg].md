 Why does complaining about stuff we can't do anything about feel so good if complaining is only here to help us in life? So remember that complaining is doing something, right? So complaining is all about emotional expression, which is doing something. And how is that helpful? So understand this. When a negative emotion is dominating your mind, it becomes very easy to become hopeless, to feel like you can't do anything to fix the problem. So one of the most fundamental steps when you're dealing with a negative emotion is to vent the negative emotion from your mind so that your mind can now operate clearly. And once your mind can operate clearly, you may be able to fix an unfixable problem. My favorite example of this is someone who gets dumped, who thinks that I will never date again because I am unlovable. They just need to vent that negative emotion and then they will start to see that if they got into one relationship, chances are they can get into another. And that generally speaking, most human beings are capable of relationships, like 99% of us. We just need to be in the right frame of mind. So complaining is absolutely an emotional step. And then once it clears our mind, hopefully we're able to do something else.
