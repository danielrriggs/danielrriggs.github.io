 So I'm doing, so anyway, so we wanted to raise money. And so it's $75,000. We've like fully funded our coaching program. So thank you guys very much. Our coaching program, which we're gonna talk about in just a couple of seconds is like, I'll lay it out for you guys, what the, you know, what we're gonna do and what our plan is. So money raised past 75,000 is gonna be like subsidizing our coaching program for people who can't afford it and also seed money for the Healthy Gamer Scholarship, which comes to our 100K milestone. So- Thanks Gabe, do it for Gabe. Do it for Gabe. 100K milestone is a scholarship. And then also because you guys need to be entertained and your appetites are great. What we're gonna do is Dank Moses has offered himself up to go on a virtual date during COVID, which we will do play by play commentary on at 100K. And this is the thing is like Moses, cause like Moses likes to put me on the spot and have me do things for you guys. But he didn't think that we, cause he was like, yeah, I'll do that at 100K. And we were like 50K back then, right? So I don't think he thought that we would get it and it's fine if we don't, no big deal. Cause you guys have given us plenty. So I'm grateful for that. And also if you guys want to, I kind of wanna do that because that'll be fun. And then Moses will learn what it's like. To dance, dance on command. Yeah, so we'll see. Also because we should help him find love to chat. Let's do it. So platform, so our coaching program, so I know we asked for money for support, but I want you guys to understand this. We started working on this back in October, November, and we've just basically been trying to do it ourselves. So it's been really awesome to have support because support buys us a lot of stuff. And so our coaching program is actually set to go live on June 3rd. We wanted to launch it in May. We originally wanted to launch it in the middle of May, but I don't know if you guys know this, but launching real things actually takes like effort and difficulty. Accountants and lawyers and like taxes. Yep. And like, what do we do? Like, how do we, like, is it legal to offer coaching in New Zealand? Because that's where some of Twitch comes from. And so we had to sort out all that kind of crap. I think it's all sorted, hopefully. And so I want to show you guys something real quick, okay? So, there we go. Let me do this real quick. Okay. So this is what our rollout looks like. So like, I know that you guys donated to support our coaching program, and we're grateful for that, but like what you guys donate for is actually ready to launch, and we're gonna launch it in a week. Okay. Week one, we have 36 spots open for individual coaching and nine spots open for group coaching. Up to eight people. So nine groups with up to eight people per group. Okay. So what that means is that our goal is by June 10th to actually be delivering coaching services to 108 people. And I know it sounds, I don't know if that number sounds big to you guys or small to you guys, but seeing as how we did fundraising for something, I think it's pretty cool that we're actually, hopefully offering, like we're gonna start actually helping people like in a week. So then, and cause we have to do like stress test it, right? Cause we built like this platform and stuff. And so then at the end of week two, we're opening up 36 more individual slots, or at the beginning of week two, 36 more individual slots and nine more groups to hopefully help 216 people. Week three, we're gonna open up 35 more spots and nine more groups for 323 people. And then week four, our group stuff is gonna be tapped out cause we don't have the supply of coaches to do more of that. And so we're gonna open up 57 more individual spots. And this is what we hope to do. So this is what I wanna say. Your donations, it is my sincere hope that one month from now will actually support the platform infrastructure and stuff like that to actually help 380 people from our community. That is really what we hope to do one month from now. And we'll have the next group of coaches and training by then. Yeah, so we're reviewing applications. So if you guys have signed up to be coaches, we're thrilled. We've gotten hundreds of applications and we're going through those and trying to find people that we think would be a really good fit for our community. And yeah, so that's the thing is like right now, we've got a limited number of coaches and really what the fundraising is for is to help us kind of iron out these things. And then also to like train future coaches cause training them is a big investment. Just so you guys know, these coaches that we're launching with, we started training them in November of 2019. So they've been in training now for like seven months and they're phenomenal. We've been working together every week for like an hour and a half at a minimum. And they've been seeing clients in our beta and they've been helping clients. And I think we've showed you that data before. So this is like, we're gonna do it. Like it's like, it's right around the corner. And so hopefully nothing falls apart. Fingers crossed to a chat. You know those, the internet gods that like tank our discord and our stream at times, like hopefully they're just okay with this stuff. Why tempt things? No, I mean, I'm not tempting. It's not tempting. It's throwing myself upon the mercy of the internet gods. Okay, so a couple of things to note about this. Okay, so if there's no, so when we launch our coaching program, if you like sign up and there's no slots, we don't have the infrastructure yet to like properly wait list people. So just check back in a week, right? Like I know that that's not how professional companies run but like just check back because we're, you know we have to build this. Well, yeah, yeah, yeah. There's gonna be some kind of wait list but like just check back and we're gonna post updates on Twitter and discord. We'll try to also update our dev log from time to time so that people can know what we're up to. And so the next thing that I wanna talk about for a minute is like, so people may be wondering, okay, what about like individual coaching or group coaching and like, you know, what's the difference? So let me just tell you guys. Okay, so the first thing is that our goal is AOE healing, right? So if we have, you know, a dozen coaches to help you guys if we think about it, like if they work one-on-one with you guys, they can only work with a certain number of clients and so the first reason to do group coaching is because we can actually help more people than individual coaching. So then the next question becomes, is individual coaching worth as much as group coaching or can you benefit because if you have individual, is that better than group? And the short answer is like somewhat. So here are the advantages of individual coaching. So you get one person who you meet on a weekly basis who helps you apply and implement what we teach on stream. So this is not like educational stuff. Like if you guys watch stuff and you like learn about meditation or you learn about emotions or you learn about alexithymia or you learn about addiction or like, I have this some scar, like you guys know a lot of this stuff. So the role of the coach is to actually support your learning and individually help you problem solve and implement things over time. And the way that I explain it is like, you're gonna learn something like, okay, like I figured out, oh, I'm alexithymic, which means I don't understand my internal emotional state. And then you're gonna try to go do something in the real world and you're gonna try to figure out alexithymia on your own and then you're gonna fail. And the role of the coach is to help you get back up when you fail and get you to try again. Because here's the thing about the gaming community. Like, I don't think you guys, I think y'all underestimate what you're capable of. Gamers can do anything once. You can work out for a day. You can work out for a week. You can even work out for a month. The problem is that when you stop working out after two weeks of working out, you never start working out again. Can you stop that? That's very distracting. I'm trying to like groove and be, okay. So like, when I really think about it, the real point of like the coaching program is like, because I think the problem, it's not that you guys are lazy, it's that like, when you start to improve, something gets in the way and then you lose all confidence in yourself and you don't even try again. Like that's what I want coaching to help you through. Just get through that bump and get you back to trying again. Because here's the crazy thing. You guys do try again eventually. So what we really wanna do is shorten the amount of time to like trying again. That's what we're really for. And so they're gonna teach you lots of stuff. They'll work with you, things like that. So that's what individual coaching is about. Now here's the reason. So getting one-on-one time with someone is actually really valuable and it's like dedicated. It's your time. You can talk about, you know, whatever is going on. Just a reminder, it's not like mental health treatment. So it's not designed to diagnose or treat a medical condition. And we're trying to train our coaches to understand when there could be a psychiatric problem going on. And then they'll try to support you in finding the appropriate help there. So why group coaching? So the reason for group coaching is because I think that when you get a group of people who struggle through something together, they can actually learn in a sense faster than one-on-one. So when we teach people, let's say like people are talking about procrastination. You can work one-on-one with your coach and work on procrastination. But when it's a group of you who are all working on procrastination together, you don't need to find the whole solution with your coach. You bring a piece of the puzzle. Someone else brings a piece of the puzzle. A third person brings a piece of the puzzle. And then you guys like work through it kind of together. And there's sort of like a party XP bonus that comes with group coaching. So group coaching is also really, really effective. I've been running groups now for a couple of years. And like, it's interesting. There was a group that I was running actually literally yesterday. And I actually asked them the question. If you think about it, do you guys think you would have gained, we're on like week 10 or 11 of the group? And I asked them, do you think that you gained more from this group or you would have gained more if you had 10 weeks of working with me one-on-one? And the answer was awesome. The answer was, I'm not sure. And that's enough of an answer for me, right? Like, cause I think the main thing about the groups is like, you guys are gonna learn from each other. And that's like very, very valuable. Like, and I just can't overestimate that. So I don't think that group coaching or individual coaching is better or worse than something else. I think it's just like there are different services and there are like different kinds of things. It's like, you know, is a multiplayer game better than a single player game? Well, like, no, it's just like, they're gonna be better at different things. What? There is some evidence though, for like what we did was we looked at like the AA model, for example, and to see what the impact is of having a sponsor on people's lives versus the impact of having like the support group. And they have different impacts and they're different kind of suitability for different people. But in general, the shared lived experience of somebody that's gone through it with you, the support of that person that has gone through a video game addiction or has also had to kind of put their life together through these kinds of circumstances that are very pervasive within the kind of demographic that you're in, means so much. So if you're somebody that really wants to like work one-on-one, maybe your life, like you're not comfortable with like more people, maybe individual coaching is for you. If you're somebody who really benefits from lots of ideas and lots of input, lots of support, and you're gonna have eight new people rooting for you. If that is something that's really important for you, group coaching could be great for you. The other thing about group coaching, so I can't underestimate this point. So the other big difference about group coaching is that in group coaching, you get to help someone else. That is huge, right? Cause like even individual coaching, sometimes people will drop out if they're feeling depressed or sad or they don't feel like they're worth it, right? Cause sometimes when you guys start to move forward in life, all these thoughts creep up and they say, oh, you're never gonna amount to anything. You're wasting other people's time, all this kind of stuff. The cool thing about group coaching is you can't drop out of something if some other people are depending on you. You cannot drop out of group coaching, please God. We haven't built it for lots of cancellations. It's very complicated. Please don't drop out of group coaching. So make the commitment to yourself, make the commitment to your coach, make the commitment to your group that you're gonna show up and be there. Yeah, so group coaching is great because you get to help other people and then you get to feel good about yourself cause when someone tells you, hey man, I was really struggling with this and what you said actually really helped me, that's incredibly powerful for them and for you. And then a crazy thing happens after group coaching, people start to develop value in who they are. It's crazy. And I'd love to do that and be able to show it. Okay. Going live next week, you guys. We're really, really excited. And again, thank you so much for funding the platform. We've actually already spent half of that and we're just hoping that we could make some of that back so we don't go in the hole later. But thank you for your support. Group coaching. Okay. It is distracting, you're right. So thanks for your support. And then also we're really excited to be able to offer these sessions at such a low price. You guys are the best. Okay, so next thing is, so that if you guys are just curious, so we're hoping to train the next coaches at an accelerated rate. And I'm gonna be training them hopefully on a daily or like multiple times a week basis. And so we hope to have our next batch of coaches out like probably within three months at the earliest. And I know that we may, more people may want coaching but like we're really committed to like high quality coaches and sometimes that takes time. And a big part of our training is that, so what we basically do is we have coaches go through like an educational portion where I teach them certain skills and how to talk to people. And we explain like principles around gamers and stuff like that. They basically like are sitting in class with me. And then we also go through a supervised coaching portion where they actually work with clients. And then like every week we talk about their client, talk about their sessions and we sort of do like a play by play, it's almost like replay analysis of their coaching sessions. And like currently I'm doing all of that personally. So they get like, I work with all of the coaches to like help them become effective over a period of a minimum of two months of like supervised coaching. And the coaches themselves are in this group and they learn from each other. It's just a really cool circular thing. Do you wanna talk a little bit about what makes a good coach to see people that are interested in becoming a coach? Yeah, so I think the most important thing for being a good coach is first of all, you have to have been through it, right? Like you have to know, like I think the reason that our coaches do a good job is because they know what it's like to be in your shoes. The second thing is that you can't be at the bottom of your barrel to be a good coach. So like the coaches that we're looking for are people who have like started to put their lives together and can keep a schedule and show up every week, right? Cause like we're investing a lot of time and energy in teaching these people stuff. So, like we want them to show up every week. And then the other thing is that like a coach has to like, once you have a commitment to a client, you have to show up every week. So, you have to have some of your shit together basically. And then also like not have had your shit together in the past is basically what we're looking for. Right. And then, I mean, I think honestly, those are the two most important things. Like there's no particular degree, like you don't have to have, I mean, we get a lot of people who are interested in becoming psychotherapists or are psychotherapists or have formal mental health training. We get a lot of people who are like, you know, graphic designers and they just want to help and they're inspired by our mission. They've always wanted to help people. And like, they just couldn't spend six years getting a PhD. So like, that's fine too. And I think the whole point of the training is that we teach people a core set of skills that I don't think are specific to a therapist. Like they're like human skills, right? That's what we do at Healthy Gamers. Like we teach like, how does concentration work? How does emotion work? Like, how does all this stuff work? And these are common experiences for all humans. And really it's just like, you have to be committed to our mission. It helps if you've been on the struggle bus yourself. And it's like actually kind of important that you sort of have your shit together because people are depending. Your parents are gonna be counting on you. Yeah. And cannot, you can't let people down. That's a no-no. The other thing I would say is I've seen just this like, kind of almost indescribable motivation of service and like wanting to be of service to others, wanting to help people. That makes a really great coach, I think. Yeah. Yeah. And also, you know, I mean, we pay our coaches. Yes. So like, that's a big part of this too. So part of the reason in my experience that we pay people, dodged, astrology PhD, thanks for the gifted subs. That's pretty awesome though. Astrology PhD, can you actually get that? That's pretty sick. So the reason that we pay our coaches is because I've noticed in my personal practice that when I see clients for free and when stuff is done for free or when people volunteer their time, they don't feel beholden to provide a high quality service over an extended period of time. Like if someone is volunteering their time, they can be committed, but like on a given day, they're gonna wake up and they're gonna be like, well, I don't feel like doing this today. And then, you know, I'd say at least 50% of volunteers offer less service than like people who get paid. And then the other cool thing that we're trying to do is like, you know, pay people so that if you're a gamer and you're committed to helping other people and you like can't, you know, you can earn money. So, you know, we're, you know, it's. And this is also why we charge clients by the way. So we're trying to create other avenues to make coaching free, but we'll charge, you know, as low a price as we can. And we wanna pay coaches as high of a fee as we can because we want the best coaches and we want most clients and we wanna help the most people. That's really the goal. And I don't think, so I've worked in institutions that are based on philanthropic funding. And I think they very, very quickly lose sight of their like actual work, right? So like if you're dependent on donations, then like you can't reliably deliver a service because if the donations dry off, then like you're out of business. And we really very much appreciate all of the fundraising support and donations, but we also don't wanna be like, and this is what I'm saying. Like we started building this in November because we never wanted to be dependent on anyone's outside dime. And the fact that you guys are supporting us are like, it's awesome and we love it, but this just, I mean, it's awesome, but like there's a, like we're not, we didn't start this a month ago when we started fundraising. We're launching in a week because we started building it six months ago. Already spent that many. Yeah. It's just, you know. Okay. So a couple of thanks. So thank you guys for everyone who's, you know, gifted subs. And so big thanks to Ethan Evans, who's been a long-term supporter of the stream is a Twitch executive, Andy, for his $1,111 donation with 11 cents. He said it's because you're number one. It's because I don't see. Yeah, so. Thanks Ethan so much. And then, so thank you to Nei, N-E-I-I-G-H for a 300 euro donation, to Canonor for your $100 donation, BBoni540 for your $150 donation, Anonymous for your $100 donation. That's that guy who posts a lot on 4chan. And to TmoojaiCBE for your $100 donation. And then Anonymous donated again for $100. Oh, hi. And to Weber donated $4,926. Alistair. Hmm. I don't know who. Okay. And then Shushupana for your $300 donation. Thank you, Alistair. That's so generous. Alistair. Not only are you generous, but I really hope that Moses is quaking in his boots right now. Moses is so fucked. All right. Moses. You didn't think they were gonna do it, man. You better watch out, Moses. Twitch had come in for your ass. Man, this is gonna be so good. Okay. So now we're gonna move on to... Okay. So today, I didn't even get a chance to talk about this. So today we're gonna do a career and life advice stream. So it seems like you guys really enjoyed it. And so we're gonna do, we did a relationship advice stream, but I think a lot of people had a lot of questions about non-relationship stuff. So here we are again. We're happy to offer career or life advice. And yeah. And so it's gonna be us. So here's, we're gonna do a very similar format from what we did before. So we're gonna start with Reddit. And then here's the link for the Reddits. Okay. Hold on. Reddit links. Okay. So we're gonna start with Reddit questions. So we've had a Reddit thread that's been live for, I think about a week. We'll answer kind of like, questions sort of throughout the thread. Wait, hold on. Why does it say 98,000? What the hell? What the hell? Guys, what else can we do? Oh, a DPS. God, David, a DPS. No way. Not, not, or a Prince, or a Prince Pog. Oh man, what's this? This is fucked. Low DPM. You're too much. And me cold man, $361.69. That's awesome. Clearly 25% of everything that we do is low DPM. I know, he's like our- He's amazing. He's, he's, I mean, we assume it's a dude could be a woman, right? So let's not be, see, look at how unwoke Mrs. K is. Super unwoke. Assuming that big donors are old men. Like Alistair Weber, like could be a chick, right? You never know. You know. Okay. So- You wanna, so you're not in the words. What? You're in the words. I'm in the words? What does that mean? See the words. Oh no, this is the one that's live. Oh. So we're okay for him. Stupid. Okay, so, okay, so we're gonna do, sorry, I got distracted by the donations. Cause it's weird. Cause I actually had minimized the donations but I saw the bar fill up and it was really confusing. So we're gonna start with Reddit questions. We're gonna do, I'm sorry, I'm low DPM just blew my mind along with Alistair brain fart. Hold on. Hold on guys, I can do it. I'm a big boy. Dr. K is a big boy. Concentrate. Okay. So Reddit and then we're gonna move to Twitars. So we're gonna move to Twitter. And then the third phase is gonna be $100 text to speech. But you guys can actually offer your questions now on text to speech and we'll queue them up for later. So we've learned something. Can I just say, like, thank you so much. If you do wanna contribute more, anything in excess is just gonna go to the scholarship fund. It will go to subsidizing free services for whatever we do. Yeah. And we will also, yeah, okay. We'll also, thanks Knuckleborg for the, thanks to, I'm just imagining Moses's face right now. And I was wondering like, anything beyond 100K goes to subsequent dates for most, no, but we can't offer that yet. All right. Do the bachelorette. Dude, like the E bachelorette? Yeah, or bachelor, sorry. Yeah, okay. Bachelor, yeah. Healthy bachelor. No, but if we wanna do healthy bachelor, then we have to offer like relationship counseling. Okay, well that's your job. You know, it's interesting. So I once, I've worked with one couple that went to a marriage counselor or relationship counselor to not end up in a relationship. It's a really fascinating story. So like two people were super into each other and had fell deeply in love, but recognized that they're terrible for each other. So they actually went and got a marriage counselor to help them not be together. It's the weirdest thing I've ever heard. Okay, so Pog, you easy dodge. Maybe they just. Oh, Zilfex. Wow. Gifted subs, bro. Thank you, you guys. Thank you. Yeah, thank you guys very much. Okay, can we answer questions now? Yeah, so quickly. I have about a 10 year career working in various media and tech startups, just completed an MBA, started this company. Dr. K is almost like the extreme opposite where he didn't have great grades, took a little while to get into medical school, finally got his act together, landed a top residency, is now faculty Harvard Medical School, also started this company, just so you have a little background on our career season and I'm an MD, MPH, and I'm an MBA. Okay, so let's start at the top. All right, you guys ready for question one? No, guys, look, so I appreciate the distractions. We of course appreciate the donations, but let's remember, I mean, some people are gonna shoot me for saying this, but let's remember that we're here to answer questions. Right? So we will take a brief break from thanking everyone while we actually answer questions, which is what people I think are supporting. Okay, so how do I know the career I'm going to college for will ultimately make me happy? Edit, I'm going to be a second year computer science student. You have no idea. I think you should count on your college degree being like a secondary or tertiary thing. Think about experience, think about what you wanna do, and then you're gonna learn basically in two ways. You're gonna learn from experience and you're gonna learn from the classroom. Experience is way, way, way more valuable. We just crossed 100K. No way, oh my God. All right, Gabe, hope you're happy. Paying for Gabe's college. All right, Gabe. Remember, you still have to apply for a FAFSA though, bro. Yeah, seriously. We said that if you can't afford to go to college, we'll cover you. You know what I've been thinking about quickly? Kind of related to this question, but I feel like student loans in general is such a broken way for people to get kind of that early start, because what it's supposed to help you with is to kind of invest in yourself and set you up for a career. But I wonder if there could be, instead of student loans, like life loans, maybe college isn't it, but here's 20 grand a year for four years for you to just figure it out. Absolutely. I would love to see something like that happen. I think it would be awesome if we lived in a world where you could give an 18-year-old 20 grand that they could spend on Steam. Because that's what they're gonna do, man. Just give them a pile of cash. It's a loan, right? Yeah, but like 20 grand in my bank account is 20 grand in my bank account. Right, and then that interest rate. That interest rate is something that I can use all my games to play to ignore. Okay, well, I think it would be a cool idea. I think it would be a cool idea too. Sorry for being cynical. Because it's, I mean, like college, like speaking of things that are broken, right? Like we know healthcare is broken, but college is broken too. Well, so I think the problem that happened with college is when everyone got a guaranteed loan to go to college, colleges realized that there's no reason to keep the cost of college low, right? So like everyone was told you have to get a college degree and then you'll be happy in life. And we're gonna get to that question in a second. And you'll be successful in life. And so if you look at college tuition, the reason that it's ballooned is because there's no price pressure to keep it down. So like college administrative fees are like 400% of what they were like 30 years ago. And administrative fees, by the way, includes things like salaries for people who are like deans of colleges. And so there's like no price pressure. So then what happens is like they can charge $70,000 a year for like teaching you Spanish one on one. That's basically what happened with healthcare, right? You had like a trapped pool of people that they have insurance. Don't get me started on healthcare because I'll go on a rant that is not the purpose of why we're here. But if you guys wanna understand why the healthcare system is broken, I will bust out the iPad and I will draw you guys a diagram of why the healthcare system is broken. Let's do that at the end. But basically for your college degree, I think you cannot count on your major to be, first of all, what lands you the job or gives you the experience you need. Okay, they wanna do it. Can you go grab the iPad? I'll teach you guys why healthcare is broken. I'm gonna answer the question. I think the kids were using it. Okay, so how do I know the career I'm going to for college will ultimately make me happy? I'm going to be a second year computer science student. So here's the first question that boggles my fucking mind. Okay. Where did we get the idea that happiness comes from a career? Like, just think about that, right? There are people out there, like not just people. Most people think that the key to happiness in life is a particular career. It's like, what the fuck? That's what fucked our priorities from day one. The idea that a career will make you happy. You're screwed then and there. Forget about computer science or anything else. Like we're in a society where we presume that a particular career is going to make us happy. And it's like, wait, hold on a second. Right, so the other thing that we also did very subtly is we said, just think about, okay, just run with me, okay, Twitch. So I'm a fan of capitalism. So like, don't pin me, don't peg me as a socialist. Like just listen to what I'm saying before you lump me into a bucket. What I'm saying is, okay. So somewhere along the way, like I just really want you guys to pause and think about this. We grew up with this idea that you have a job and your job earns money. And then like you go home after your job and then you do fun stuff. Like we're taught this basic paradigm that there's like work and there's enjoyment. There are like work days and there are weekends. I don't accept that premise for a moment. And I don't believe that your career has to make you happy. Here's what I believe. And I know it's gonna sound really crazy and it's actually kind of capitalistic. So, you know, if you're a socialist, you're gonna hate me. And if you're a capitalist, you're gonna hate me. Cause I bizarre, I think that there are attributes of both things, which are good. I know it's like mind boggling. So here's what I believe. I believe that if you do something that you love, you're gonna perform at a higher level than if you do something that you don't love. And I think that the market values things that are done at the highest level. And so I actually think the best way to become successful and offer value to the rest of the world is to get really, really good at like something that you love, right? And before you guys say that's weird, like think about like, why is Twitch a thing? Like, why does Twitch even exist? It's because someone realized like, oh, I actually really like playing video games. And that's, human beings value that. And like, so we're gonna like make a platform where people can stream video games. And like, now it's a gigantic thing. So like, I don't accept that your job has to be something that like you sacrifice for your job. And then you kind of like go home and then you have fun afterward. Like I think the goal is to like find something that you can do for yourself. And so I think that's the way to do it. So I think that's the way to do it. And there's like a Venn diagram, okay? So there's this, it's not like you can do anything. So I think that there's like overlap between like, if you take the dozen things you love, because I think you love more than one thing. And then you like think about what offers value to the rest of the world. And that's where you put your money into. That's what Healthy Gamers is about. Like, I don't know if you guys recognize this, okay? Like, what does it offer value for, right? Like I trained and I offer a service and I charge a fee for that service. And then I had a grand experiment. And the grand experiment was like, even though this is not a thing where you can make money, I feel in my heart of hearts that I should not just help people who are investment bankers, nothing against investment bankers. Or people who have substance use addictions, right? So I help like heroin addicts or people with schizophrenia. I wanna help people who are gamers. And that's what I wanna do. There's no market for it. And I said, hey, I'm gonna start streaming on Twitch. And I said, hey, I'm gonna start streaming on Twitch. And I said, hey, I'm gonna start streaming on Twitch. And the reason I believe what I believe is because, hey guys, we've raised $100,000. And like, how did that happen? There's no market for this. What is the market? Like, it's not a job. Like, what, am I a Twitch streamer? Like, not really. Am I a doctor? Like, not really. Like, I'm not like a streamer, right? The main thing here is that like, figure out what you love that helps other people and makes the world a better place and then give it your all. Be really good at something. Yeah. And I think not only will you be successful, you will be happy. But that's not a career. It's like a dharma, right? And so then now the question is, how do I figure out my dharma? Well, look, before we go there, I think it's also a matter of patience, right? You've put in what? Five, six years into finding this space in the world? I mean, so like, when I was training to become a psychiatrist, I started asking people like, what do you guys think about video game addiction? And no one understood what the fuck I was talking about or what they were talking about, right? One lady who's a brilliant psychoanalyst told me, I think the reason that people get addicted to video games is the same reason they get tattoos. And I was like, lady, what are you talking about? Those are not related at all. And anyway, so here, I think maybe what Kruthi's point is is then, so that your question is like, how do I find what I love and how do I find what has value to the world? And Kruthi's spot on that it takes patience. Like my journey started 16 years ago. So it takes time to figure it out, right? And I had a career along the way. Like I had a career, you know, which I'm sort of shutting down by the way, FYI. So we're gonna spend more time on Healthy Gamer because this is a thing now. Okay, so like, I feel like people are past the healthcare thing. So do I need to do that or are we done? Let's go back to it. Let's stick to career. That's what we said we were gonna do. Okay, bonus healthcare rant. Okay. Go back to Reddit. Go back to Reddit. No, but they're saying do it. Do it, please. Everyone's saying do it. Stick to career. Poll, poll. See, we can do this now because you guys have supported Boomer Dr. K because Boomer Dr. K doesn't know how to do these things. Healthcare DLC. Okay. Legendary pancake. Oh my gosh, the last word. I don't know how to see the poll. Usually they can see the poll. But let's do another question while we're waiting. Okay. So the short answer is how do I know that a career I'm going to for college will ultimately make me happy? It won't. And you shouldn't think that a particular career will make you happy. I don't plan on that at all. So I think you should try to find something that you're interested in and curious about and offer some value to the world. And then finding happiness is like, I know it sounds cheesy, but comes from within, right? So you can find, a degree in computer science is not going to make you happy. The kind of job that you get afterward can heavily influence your happiness. But you're not going to know that from the get go, right? You could end up working for, let's say TripAdvisor and building stuff that you think is cool. Or you could hate TripAdvisor because what you really want to do is make a video game. Or you can be the people who help us develop our apps and our technology backend. And there are programmers and stuff who have a skillset and they like, I think they enjoy what they do because they're a part of our mission. So I hope that they feel somewhat fulfilled. I mean, I'm not really sure. And so I think it's like an evolving process. So like, I want you guys to step away from the idea that a decision you make today is the right decision or is the wrong decision. Because life is like a long-term game. It's not like you make a decision today and then you're screwed for the rest of your life. It's evolution, right? Like I built a career and now I'm walking away from it because of you fuckers. She is too, by the way. She dumped her career. She's actually completely walked away from her career. Yeah, because of you fuckers. And- Because of me fucker, actually. Well, so here's the thing. When it comes to career stuff, I would plan for like, what's the second thing? Always use like the job that you're gonna take or the degree that you're gonna pick or whatever as like a means to an end, right? Because you're not really doing it for that first job out of school. You're doing it for kind of the long-term. So everything you do, think about it for the long-term where you wanna be years out from now. And it doesn't have to be a super crystal clear picture. It can be a general sense of like, I just wanna help this kind of person or I just wanna start this kind of company and then figure out kind of the skills you need and the experience you need. And experience is not necessarily doing it well. It's just giving it a shot. Yeah, I mean, I disagree with that a little bit because I think sometimes it's hard to know what the long-term is in the short-term. So I think you have to take the next best step, right? And just, anyway. Tina Tree says 37 and still no clue what I should do. Absolutely, man. Oh wait, are you talking about me or are you talking about you? For a second there, I read that and I thought you were talking about me and I was like, you're damn right. But then I realized. Just the club. Okay, healthcare later, okay. Okay, so we're gonna do healthcare rant later. Okay, great. All right, got him. Okay, then let me turn this off. All right, so next question. How to choose a career when everything interests you but you can't make a decision. For example, I graduated economics high school, thought it was interesting. Right now I'm in college studying occupational health and safety but I'm also interested in other fields like computer sciences and such. Although I realize choosing a career now doesn't have to be final, I feel like I'm unfocused. Any tips on getting focused and making a choice? So this is a trap. Choosing kind of your trade is a trap. You can combine all of that stuff. That sounds like you might really like something like business development and a digital health company or something like that. So you can think about kind of the ecosystem you wanna work in but also then what your particular skillset can be to support something like that. I'm gonna scoot up a little bit. Well, if I scoot up, then when you do your hand gestures, you're gonna just smack me. No, I will. Because if we do that, we'll get banned and then we'll disappear like a puff of smoke for $100,000. Bye. Calculated. Okay, so I kind of agree with what Ruthie's saying because I'll give you guys another example. Myself, right? So I like video games and I like mental health and I like helping people and I like to meditate. And so instead of thinking about that is choosing between those things, it's about sort of putting them together in some way. And you don't know that at the get-go, right? So basically like when I started training as a psychiatrist in year two of my residency, I started like focusing on video games on the side because I was curious about that. And then I started working on it like a couple hours a week and then it became a little bit more and a little bit more. And then like five years down the road, I found fertile ground for it and you kind of combine stuff. Now in this person's case, like it's kind of tough, right? Because economics, occupational health and safety and computer science, like it's a stretch even for me to combine those things. So simple to me actually. How so? Occupational health and safety. Like, I don't know, what is that first of all? It's like occupational health, like how to keep employees like safe and healthy. So you know like- Okay, so that in tech, like that makes total sense, right? You can create technological solutions for encouraging occupational health and safety. That's a market, like that has real value in the world. Economics, absolutely. Who doesn't need economics? If you're building a business, you have to have some sense of economics. So I think the other thing to remember is that when you train in a particular discipline, it's not just about the content, it's about the skills. Right, so like if you train in economics, it's not just like markets that you're learning about, you're learning about mathematics and modeling. So mathematics and modeling, like we have, we do mathematics and modeling at Healthy Gamer in terms of like, okay- Economics, right now in this environment where like there's just so much, like the economic climate right now is fascinating. I think anyone who cares about that and can understand that is gonna do really well in kind of creating a new business and a new market. Yeah, completely agree. And just to kind of zero in, so if you wanna study computer science like people are saying in chat, that applies to any field because that's true. So this is where you stop and you think a little bit, like you do a little bit of forward thinking and you think like, okay, what are the things that are the most, what step is gonna give me like the most moves down the road? So I would think that like, you know, studying programming in some way or computer science is like maybe a good idea. But the other cool thing about this, and this is why I think it's sort of like a silly thing to restrain yourselves to education is that you can learn how to program without getting a CS degree. In fact, I'm pretty sure that Google and Microsoft no longer require bachelor's degrees to work for them. Like they just hire people based on the skillset that you have. And then this kind of goes back a couple months ago, we did like at the beginning of COVID, I did a brief thing about how to get the job of your dreams. We can do that again today if you guys want to. But it's actually like a pretty simple, it's not an easy process, but it's like actually a pretty simple process of like how to get the job of your dreams. And I can walk you through that. I've actually done that with people and they're like, they have jobs now. There's also, by the way, a couple of resources in our Discord. If you want like a real kind of road map, make sure you join the Discord. Okay, so we've got two DLCs today, that's fine. What's a DLC? What's a DLC Twitch app? Gamer, yes, guilty. Guilty! What's the female version of Boomer? See, this is what I love about Twitch chat. We can ask them what a DLC is, you're not even getting an answer. No, just. Okay, no one tell her to go chat. Okay. We're just gonna keep going. The opposite of a Boomer is Karen. Thanks for nothing. No, dude. Dude, a Karen is so different. Okay. But this is a really good problem to have, to choose a career where everything interests you. Like my baby sister, for example, she was debating between whether she wanted to be an astrophysicist and do a math major and go on that side, or if she wanted to go to film school. And she decided to pick film school, because then she could make movies about space, which she's doing. Okay, so I'd say, just think a little bit about what content interests you the most. And then you can also do like a calculation about like, what's your starting salary gonna be if you pick one of these disciplines? And then just take the next step forward. And then you can kind of, you can work through it later. How do you find a solid group of friends? Good question. And how do you move from friends to close friends? I find it hard to connect with others since I don't feel like I click or relate to them as well. But I'm not sure if I'm expecting too much for a click. Basically a common sense of humor, values, interests, or that I should develop the friendships anyway, since it can still have value. I'm in university right now, and I know it's a good time to make friends, but it feels like people aren't that interested and don't reciprocate the effort to become friends, which is fair since they're not obligated to be friends with me, but it is incredibly demotivating. Since high school, I've never really felt like I belong. Also, when I become friends with someone, I often run out of things to talk about eventually. So any advice on that will be appreciated as well. Thoughts? Yeah. I'm more thinking about like running out of things to think about or talk about. And I know that that happened to me when I was so busy or focused on a specific thing that I didn't know what was going on in the world anymore. But when I'm engaged with what's going on in the world, I have more to talk about because I know about more things that are happening and they're more relevant, I don't know. Yeah, so I have two answers to this and they run contrary to each other. The first is that I think sometimes it just takes time to find your people. Yeah. Right, so like I joined a fraternity when I was a freshman and I ended up finding my people within that fraternity, but that took actually three years. Like I felt like an outsider in my fraternity for two years and then it was actually when I moved into the frat house junior year that I really like got close to these people that I had known for years. And so sometimes, like, you know, so sometimes it just takes time to find your people or like have the circumstance where you're ready to engage and they're ready to engage. It's about momentum too, right? Like once you start one thing, like you make friends with one person, then like that kind of like you reach out to the network, you know? Yeah, you're saying something very lucid and they're typing Dr. Chad Thundercock. I don't know what that means. I think they've stopped paying attention to what you're saying and what I'm saying too. Next question then. No, no, we're gonna still answer this question. It's just, we gotta give them a second to like calm down. Right? What does Dr. Chad Thundercock, like why would that mean anything to anyone? Can I make sexually inappropriate comments? Oh, why stop now? Dr. Chad Thundercock is what happened last night. Oh! I don't know what I'm gonna do. When we watch Netflix and fell asleep. Yeah, okay. That was a good time. All right. Okay, so anyway, so going back to the serious question. At least I got her to high five, guys. She's a good sport. She's a good sport. So yeah, so the other thing is that, this person says, I wanna read out what this person says. So, but I'm not sure if I'm expecting too much for a click or that I should develop friendships. I'm in university right now. I know it's a good time to make friends, but it feels like people aren't that interested and don't reciprocate the effort of becoming friends. I think this is a really important point. So I think as a human race, we are getting worse at making friends. So social media and technology, the things that make you feel awkward are not like specific to you. They're actually the result of a brain that spends more time interacting with technology than like interacting with other human beings. So I think everyone's ability to make friends skill is like five points lower than it used to be like 15 years ago. So it's like literally harder to make friends now because other human beings like don't know how to do it properly and you don't know how to do it properly. And then you guys all feel anxious and you're in your head the whole time. And then you feel awkward and they feel awkward. And then it's just like, it's harder. It's just harder. It is interesting because for us, it's easier to keep our friends with technology. But for you guys growing up with this, it's much harder. Yeah. Yeah. So one or two other things. Okay. So the second thing is that like when I become friends with someone, I often run out of things to talk about eventually. So you shouldn't go into that relationship trying to check off things to talk about, right? Like maybe what you should do is, I know it's super awkward, but just be silent and let them talk. And then when they talk, when they start doing, because right now like this person is doing all the heavy lifting in the relationship. It's like, okay, this person, I'm asking question, asking question, asking question. And then like, they stopped talking for a second. It's like, boom, second question, third question, fourth question, fifth question. And you're like not giving the space to like participate in the conversation. So just be quiet and let them carry some of the heavy lifting. And then like, they're gonna feel super awkward when you don't say anything. And they're gonna start getting anxious about themselves when you don't say anything. And then they're gonna try to say something. And then you respond by being super excited and appreciative. And then they're like, this person likes me. And then you guys talk about that. And then it becomes natural because then they don't feel anxious. You have to tolerate that awkwardness for like a few, like 15, 30 seconds where you're not saying anything. And then like they feel relieved and then they're gonna be relaxed and then you're gonna feel good. And it's like, it's fine. So just like be silent. Don't do all the heavy lifting. Let them do some of the lifting. Got it? So you like- Don't try too hard. If it's not clicking, just don't invest more into kind of like a circle of friends. That's not gonna happen. Okay. So, all right. Should we, let's go down a little bit because people posted stuff like days ago. Okay. Okay. So I recently started working my first job after studying engineering. I was also employed by the company that I'm currently working for during my studying time. And the job pays decent. The colleagues are great and the work is challenging on a regular basis. But it's not what I wanted to do with the degree. And I also don't believe that my work is even remotely related to my Dharma. As I'm also struggling with self-worth, depression and all that jazz, I was wondering where to focus first. Pick up therapy again and use that to grow as a person or finding a better fitting job or train for it first for that matter. Or to find an act on Zadharma. Assuming this would lead to a greater sense of fulfillment, maybe help self-confidence issues and act as an amplifier for the therapy success. What's your take? Also, thanks for all the great work you were doing with Healthy Gamer Gigi. Already helped me getting some insights on how I work internally, though this can be intimidating or disgusting at times. That's true. Okay, so basically I think the question is, I got a job, studied engineering, pays decent, colleagues are great, work is challenging on regular basis, but it's not what I wanted to do and I don't believe it's related to my Dharma. Also, I'm dealing with confidence and depression and self-worth. Yeah. Where do I start? I mean, I think the career is not your issue. So I don't think you need to make a dramatic career change. I would focus on figuring out the other stuff. I think finding Dharma is a really good place to start. So I'd offer a slightly different perspective. I agree with Kruthi that I don't think that your career is the problem right now, because if it's challenging on a regular basis, I'm assuming that's a good thing. If you like your colleagues and if it pays decent, I wouldn't move quite yet. So the first thing to understand is that if you're struggling with depression or self-worth, because this guy's starting to understand how they work, let me ask you guys, if you're depressed, how do you think that affects the quality of choices you make about your life? Right, so the first thing to understand is if you're trying to figure out where to go in life, you need a map or a GPS that's functional. And if you're depressed, your mind is not going to be thinking clearly. So the first thing you should do is probably do something like find a therapist. And I don't think it's coincidental that that's the first thing that you thought of in terms of your response. So work on your depression and self-worth a little bit and get your mind clear-headed, because a clear-headed mind can make good decisions. And you're right though that working on your dharma is gonna give you a sense of confidence and satisfaction. So you can do it that way too. But the other thing to remember about dharma, which I haven't done a good job of explaining, is you don't find your dharma, your dharma finds you. And I think that if you're feeling somewhat directionless and you have low self-worth, your dharma is waiting for you to get your shit together before it presents itself. Because if you've got low self-worth, you're not ready to do it. I couldn't have started a healthy game a decade ago because I wasn't ready. I just wasn't ready, even though I liked helping people, I just wasn't ready. So first focus on yourself. Start to get a little bit clear-headed. It sounds like you're learning a lot about yourself, so continue learning a lot about yourself. And then dharma will present itself when it's ready and you can continue looking for it. And then also over time as you start to get clear-headed, the last thing that I wanna say, and I think you've already addressed this, is that you don't have to do them sequentially. So if your work isn't fulfilling, what is it that's missing for your work and how can you start doing a little bit of that? Because this person said, I don't feel like it's aligned with my dharma. It implies to me that they know what their dharma is. And kind of go from there. Okay. So let's do this one. Sure. I'm preparing to give the GMAT so I can get an MBA and eventually immigrate to another country. I have a problem being disciplined with self-studying and preparing on my own. Have seen your procrastination video. I realized that I fall in the first category and need to grieve my loss. I need to grieve my loss of expectations of a high score, but I'm unable to do so. I want to be able to achieve that, the I don't give a fuck mental state for this test is that's when I perform the best. I know I'm capable enough to score very high, but I feel like I'm getting in my own way and getting in touch with my head too much. What can I do? You wanna give this one a shot or? I mean, I kind of feel like taking it, but you wanna say something? Because you've actually taken the GMAT. I still remember the question. This was like seven years ago that I got wrong. It was the very end because I just panicked and I didn't reduce 65 over 13. Like I still remember that. And if I had gotten that question right, I would have gotten better GMAT test, but guess what? It would not have changed a single thing about my life. I would have still gone to the business school I went to. It wouldn't have changed a damn thing. Yeah, 65 over 13. Yeah, not many things are divisible by 13. It's a fucking trick question. That's the whole GMAT. Anyway, think about exactly how your life is gonna change depending on your score. And if you want it, if that is what is really important to you, then yeah, I think try for it. I don't think not giving a fuck is a good way to go. I think you have to give a fuck about becoming who you're meant to be. So I'm gonna unpack this for a second, okay? So I want you guys to look at this. I think we should just keep posting the questions here. I want to be able to achieve the, I don't give a fuck mental state for this test is that's when I perform the best. Okay. I know I am capable enough of scoring very high. This is the problem. You can't have this thought and this together. Because then you will not reduce 65 over 13. Right, this is the expectation that you create for yourself and you make it sound like a good thing, right? So this is the real problem. You guys think about it. We say things to ourselves and our parents say things to us. And we think it's a positive thing. Like when we say, I have potential, we make it sound like a positive thing. But it's not a positive thing. It's a burden. It's an expectation, right? It's like, when you say, you know you're capable of scoring very high, I don't think you're capable of that. Capability is a positive thing. Capability is a hypothesis. It's not a reality. Like you guys get that? Like capability is not a real thing. It's a potential. It's not real. So when you say I'm capable, I think you're envisioning a perfect world where you're disciplined and you sit down every day and you study and all that kind of stuff. And like, sure, but like you don't have that discipline. So why do you think that's capable? It's like, for some reason, we take certain attributes of ourself, and then we're left with something that isn't who we are. And we base our capability on this fantasy of who we think we are. That you're not, it's like, if I imagine in my head that I have wings and I was a unicorn, I could fly. I'm capable of flying. Yeah, man, that's kind of true, but you're not a unicorn with wings, bro. So you can't fly. So when you fantasize about this person that you could be, and then you think about the accomplishments that you make, and then you call yourself capable of making those accomplishments, but like, that's not real. Right? So when you say you're capable, I don't think you are. Start with the idea that until you have a good GMAT score behind you, you're not capable of a good GMAT score. To me, this sounds like he kind of got a good score once, and what he can't do is be consistent. You're assuming it's a dude, but sure. Okay. I mean, I think the way that you start is by acknowledging that you may not be able to get a good GMAT score. The way that you start, it's not don't give a fuck mental attitude. It's the sitting down and studying and saying, I'm gonna try to get the best GMAT score that I can. And like, I'm gonna just study today for a certain amount of time until I can't study anymore. And if that's an hour, that's great. If it's two hours, that's great. If it's five hours, that's awesome. And then tomorrow I'm gonna wake up the next day and I'm gonna try to study. And then it's just, you don't worry about what you're capable of because capability puts your mind in the future and then you're no longer in the present. And what you need to be in to study is in the present. You can't be in the future. So get rid of this idea of capability. That's your problem. Switch to AMAB there's something. Okay, switch to AMAB. Oh, there we go. Sorry, I switched out. Do you want to skip over? Yes. This way? Okay, okay. No, no, no, but now I'm in the middle and you're kind of awkward and behind me. It's weird. I'll be like this. Okay. All right. Any study tips for standardized exams? Absolutely. So I think study first thing in the morning. Okay, so your mind is freshest. So if you guys want DLC number three, we'll teach you guys how to study. So, so study, better to study first thing in the morning or first thing after you wake up. And what I would try to do is like, don't worry about a particular goal, worry about an action. So it's not about like scoring a certain amount of score. It's about studying a certain amount of time. So I'm gonna do 50 practice questions today. It's not like I'm gonna get 50 practice questions right. Because when it comes to standardized tests, we're score oriented, we're not action oriented. Right. Trying to work. Okay. Also sleep. Yeah, sleep is good. I took naps and then I could like wake up and I would take my practice questions, do something else, eat something, take a nap. And then when I woke up and like reviewed my questions, I could process them better. I'm also a big fan of napping when you're like studying for standardized tests. So I would wake up like super early. Like I would study from like 4.30 to like maybe eight or nine. And then I would like hang out for a little while, just relax, like eat, watch something. I'd take a nap in the afternoon and then I'd like go to a coffee shop when I woke up at like 5pm and bang out two or three more hours. I agree with this a lot. This worked for me too, because the other thing that kind of phases you about like when you take these exams is like when you go into that stupid room. I don't know what they're doing nowadays if you can take them just for your taste buds. So people who's, sorry. People who are saying like 20 minutes, I'm not talking about 20 minutes nap, man. I'd sleep for like two or three hours. Yeah, get the rim. Like take a nap, dude. And just when you wake up, it's like, all right. Like I'd wake up around four or 4.30, like brush my teeth and then like pack a bag, pack a snack and go to a coffee shop. Just get your ass out the door. Like, don't worry about studying. Just get out the door and go to a coffee shop and bring your books with you. And the study, I know it sounds weird. You don't study for three hours. What you do is pack your bag and walk out the door and go to a coffee shop. And then once you sit at the table with your cup of coffee and the books in your bag, like what do you think is gonna happen? And then you gotta be careful. Like, so cell phones weren't so bad when I was studying, but then like, you know, you silence your cell phone, you put it away, whatever. So you gotta watch out for that. But, and then you study. The other thing I got this tip from you too was, so the GMAT in particular weights verbal scores higher than the quant scores. And I remember you used to tell people to read things like the New Yorker, like read things that are really dense and boring, like The Economist and whatever about a topic that you don't like that much. So like reviews and museum reviews. And like when you get, so not exactly the practice material, but like exercise that part of your brain that's just digesting information that you're not very good at. Okay. Which one? Yeah. How do you get over the fear of not achieving your full potential career-wise? You can work at something every day forever or not achieve your dream and that terrifies me. You know, I think this kind of goes back to what I was saying earlier. Like where do you get the idea of full potential? Like what does that even mean? Like, you know, like, I don't even, I literally don't know what that means. Like it's not a thing. Like full potential is not a thing. Like are we at our full potential? I don't know. Like I could certainly play fewer video games and spend more time like creating content and streaming more and sleeping less and browsing Reddit less and watching Twitch less. Am I at my full potential? No. I think the problem is that you guys are so caught up with full potential, like you're not focused on good enough. It's like, you know, like think about the last yummy meal you had. Was it perfect? Did it achieve its full potential? No, but it was like probably pretty good. It was like good enough, man. So now people say I'm not okay with good enough. Excellent point. So let's talk about that for a second. The reason that you're, so the more ashamed of yourself you are, the more you need to reach your full potential to make yourself feel better. And I want you guys to think about like self-worth is here and the more shame you have, the higher you need to achieve to like even it out and end up here. So something's really silly. Something really dangerous happens. Is your shame increases and you have the option to do this. You say it's not enough, so I'm not gonna do it. You have the option to do this and you say it's not enough, so I'm not gonna do it. And as you miss those two opportunities, shame decreases. And then this, oh, it's not enough. I can achieve more. So the only thing that moves you forward is perfection. And then you're fucked. Right, because like this is what really happens. Shame down here. Do this good. Oh, like, hey, I actually like that was pretty cool. Like I actually did something for myself today. Bump. Oh, like maybe I can do, okay, fine. Like bump. And then you didn't even achieve as much. Something funny happens. Can you take solace in that? And then like, oh, I'm not ashamed of myself. Like, oh, like maybe I'm really capable of things. And like maybe I can like do that next thing. Whoa, crazy man. Get rid of potential. It's this problem of escalating impossibility. Do we have a video about this? I don't think so. Okay, so I know I've lectured about it before. It's like the more behind you fall, the more impossible your task becomes. And the way that I explain is let's say you've got a month to study for a final, right? Like you have to study, let's say one hour a day for the next month and like 30 hours and you'll be fine for your final. And so, okay, I got to study for 30 hours, no big deal. I can wait a week. So you wait one week and then, or let's say you wait two weeks because you're a procrastinator. And now instead of studying one hour a day, you have to study two hours a day. So the less time that you have, the more work that you have to do. And then you're like, I don't know if I really want to study two hours a day. All right, so then another week goes by and now you have to study four hours a day or like 4.25. And you're like, man, that's a lot of studying. Like, I don't know, like you put in an hour here, you put in an hour there and then like three days go by and the final is three days away. And now you've got to study 10 hours a day. You're like, oh shit, I have to study 10 hours a day. You like think about cramming and you're like, man, put in like an hour or two and it's not enough. And then like one day goes by and now you have to study 25 hours in two days. And the closer you get to the end, the bigger the pile is. And then like studying 25 or 30 hours in two days is too much. Then you feel overwhelmed and you're like, fuck it, I can't do it. I should have started a month ago. Man, I wish I would have started a month ago. And then you beat yourself up over that. And then like, you can't even study 25 hours because you're like beating yourself up. It's the problem of escalating impossibility. And then the problem is like when there's one day away and you've dug really deep and you've studied 10 hours and there's one day left and you need to study 20 more. And you're like, that's impossible, I can't do it. Then you feel bad about yourself. And you cram and cram and cram and you wind up with a C, you end up passing class and you're fucking beating yourself up. Right? Like that's the problem of escalating impossibility. And so the more ashamed of yourself you feel, the more Herculean you need to do to feel good about yourself, right? It's gotta be like, you can't just be successful. Like when you're 25 and at home and like broke and like all of your friends have jobs or maybe none of your friends have jobs because they're all broke like you. And then like occasionally you meet like real people who like have jobs and shit. And then like you've got to, you can't just get a job at that point, right? Like you can't make 25K a year like doing sales at a pest control business. Like you can't go face those people who like graduated from college and got careers and say like, yeah, I work in pest control. It's like a step forward for you, but it's not enough. You're not ready to talk to them until you walk in and you say, yeah, I started my own multi-million dollar conglomerate. What's up? That's what you need. Cause that's your potential. And unless you can get that, you're not gonna move a single step forward. And that's what screws you, right? So start with pest control. Start with the lowest thing that you can possibly do and like let go of your fucking ego because your ego is not helping. It's the ego that wants to walk in and say like, look at how big I am. Look at all that shame, it's gone. No, it's not gone. You're cloaking it with ego. Shame's still there, man. You guys see that? How like the ego like compensates for the shame. Like the two exist together. Let them both go. Don't just get a job. So here's the other thing, right? So like a lot of people, a lot of times people are saying, think I'm saying like, just do this. Just go get your friend, go, just go make friends. Just go get a job. Just go get a job. Just go get a job. Just go make friends. Just go get a job. Just go find a girlfriend. No, no, no. I'm not saying just go do anything. In fact, I'm not even saying do anything at all. What I'm saying is pay attention to the thing that holds you back from acting and study it and learn it and conclude for yourself whether this thing is holding you back and then try to take action and see what happens. That's the strategy. Don't just like go do something because if you guys could just go get a job, you would have done it by now. What's holding you back is not a lack of capability, it's a lack of understanding. And that's why this is like great, right? Because you guys are good at understanding. If we had to make you guys disciplined and like not lazy, we would fit. Can't do that. But we can teach you something because y'all can learn because y'all are fucking smart. So that's the hand that we're dealt. That's the hand that we're gonna play. Respect for smartness, not discipline. Just go do it as for people who have high discipline scores. Sorry for the rant. Okay, all these questions are the same. Okay, you pick them. Okay. Ooh, I like the, how do I stop feeling like I'm better than others? Well, that's a good one. Where is that? Okay, how do I stop feeling like I'm better than others and stop constantly comparing myself to others? I mean, I feel like this is more my wheelhouse. You wanna talk about this? It's more your wheelhouse. No, it's just like psychology stuff. I mean, I was just in a room with 120 other people that all thought they were better than everybody else. And that's what business school really is. And the people that did the best there and that I have seen consistently are the people that recognize that they have something to learn from everyone. So it's almost like to be better, to continue being better, recognize that to keep that edge, you have to keep learning and everyone has something to teach you. Wise words. I mean, I'd say that- Those were the people that were actually the best. Yeah, so I think that it's like, if you just think about the concept of, when you say, how do I stop comparing myself? The first thing that you have to look at is, when you feel better, why does your mind think that you're better? And what does that do for you? So feeling better, feeling like you're smarter than other people. I don't know if you guys have seen the subreddit, Iamverysmart, but it's a brilliant subreddit. But just think about what psychological function does feeling better than someone else serve? And what it serves is that actually you don't have confidence in yourself because the confident person doesn't care about what the other people are doing. What you actually have is like shame. So since you don't have a true sense of your own capability, your sense of worth comes out of superiority of other people. Like you don't have that intrinsic sense of value. So like you have to, your value is derived out of comparison. It's like, if I have a $5 bill and I don't know what that's worth and I compare it to a $1 bill and a $10 bill, it's like the worth of the $5 bill is like a comparison of those two things. What about people that have like parents that are constantly comparing? Like, is that like a learned behavior? Yeah, so when you have parents who constantly compare you to other people, it makes you feel shitty about yourself. And then you start comparing yourself to other people and feeling superior because that's how you deal with your low sense of self-worth. Because they don't acknowledge you as a human being, they acknowledge you as someone in reference to someone else. It's like you don't have intrinsic value. Your sense of self is dependent on how we compare you to other people. Like that's what you're teaching the kid. Right, like that's what happens. And then you get all these egotistical Indian kids. And then they're like, oh. Sorry. I'm like me. Tell me, tell me, tell me. How are they? You tell me, you tell us. What's it like being married to one? Oh, geez. I feel like I just have to mock you a decent amount. No, no, no, I mean, but did you guys see like, I said, I feel like this is in my wheelhouse. And she was like, do you see how this like, you feel like everything is in your wheelhouse. Like there it is, right? It's like, as much as I try to escape being an egotistical Indian man, it chases after me. This is the thing, you don't have to conquer it. You just have to like recognize it and sort of try to keep it in check some of the time. I'll help. Viggy G123 says, that doesn't help with stereotypes about our race. Yeah, you know, it's the experience that I grew up in. So it's what I know. It also like, so like, no joke. So I grew up, there were five people in my town in Texas. There were five people who were in my grade who were Indian. Three of them were doctors. It's like, come on, man. Three out of five are doctors. Yep, and they went to med school on time. Yeah, I went, I was the reject. I went to med school late. Like they were done with residency when I was starting med school. And there was some shame there, but you know, you get over it. Okay. Yeah, so just to answer this person's question, how do I stop feeling like I'm better than others and stop constantly comparing myself to others? So what you have to find is why you need to feel better than others, because that's a response of your psychology. That's a need that your mind is fulfilling for you by creating those thoughts. It's protecting you from something. So find where the source of why you feel like you need to be better than others is, and then the comparison will go away as you heal that thing. You gotta find like, why do I feel like I'm not good enough? That's the question you've gotta ask yourself. And then like, if you wanna do like an exercise, like stop and think about when did I start to feel like I wasn't good enough? When did I start to compare myself? And what happened around that time? And you gotta dig into that. Comparing yourself, I think is also kind of a, you know, if there's only five slots open for something, right, you have to compare yourself because you're trying to compare yourself because you're trying to be good enough to be in one of those five slots. So I think if you're in that kind of rat race, it's hard not to. Yeah, so I mean, she's spot on, right? Like, so the other thing that we have to remember is that our society chains us to compare. This person was talking about Indian stereotypes, but like literally, like even now, my mom like compares me to other people. And it's like, I don't, I'm confused. Like, anyway, and it still bothers me because like that's a leftover hurt from when I felt like she wasn't treating me like a person. It's like, I shouldn't, it shouldn't even bother me. She wants to compare me fine. Like it's no big deal. Like, you know, no sweat off my back. But that's a leftover hurt that I have from, like it triggers my shame from before anyway. But I think we have to remember that our society literally like compares us. And social media makes this worse. So before we used to have like sort of a informal hierarchy and we would occasionally like elevate some people like very explicitly, right? Like some people would get awards or trophies or like have the highest GPA, valedictorian class president. And the rest of the people, like only 10% of people or less got an actual like physical representation of their value compared to the other students. Now with social media, it's like, how many followers do you have? It's like almost a way for our brain to rank our value as human beings in comparison to other human beings. And so that's why I think these problems are getting worse with mental health because like social media lets you like feel bad as a human. Like I am less accepted than I was yesterday because when I posted got fewer likes, right? So we've like formalized that process and reinforced a society that compares us. And so it's harder to not compare yourself. And then like, if we think about it, the more like just kind of tying things together, the person who gets bent out of shape because their post has less likes doesn't have an intrinsic sense of confidence because if they did, they wouldn't give a shit how many likes they get, right? So it's like, it all loops back together. So social media basically enhances that dynamic. Let's do this one. Okay. Where's the line? So where's the line between supporting a friend and acting as a therapist? I find a lot of the time I want to be there for friends and people I meet in life. When they come asking for help, they share their problems. I talk with them and help them untangle some of the uncertainty they're feeling. But at the same time, I'm concerned about overstepping and acting more as their therapist. I'm unclear about where exactly that line is. I feel the term therapist it's used quite liberally these days which creates some confusion. What do you think? This is more your wheelhouse. Okay. So, a lot of people think that what we do on therapy, I mean on stream is therapy. So let me explain, like I agree that therapy is used somewhat liberally and people have like sort of lost sight of what true therapy is. So talking to someone about their emotions and their life is not therapy. That's what we do, right? We talk to people about emotions or therapy. I mean, emotions or feelings or hurt or whatever. Like that's why I think what we do is better described as coaching because it's not anyway. So like, just because you talk to someone about emotions and support them doesn't make you a therapist. Like that's the job of a friend, right? Is to help them talk through things and understand things. I think the real issue is like, are you trying to help them and I'm not just saying this for legal purposes, but really like a therapist is a one way relationship that is designed to support someone with like a particular psychological issue. And the way that we oftentimes describe those is like a diagnosis, right? So the first thing about a therapy relationship versus a friend relationship, is it two way or is it one way? If it's two way, it's not therapy. Sometimes those people need your support and sometimes you need their support. If you are having a one sided relationship with someone, then you should really consider why do you consider that a friendship? Because then it's like more of a therapy sort of role, right? So when you have a friend, there should be some amount of two way to it. The second thing is that like, if you help people untangle things in their life, that's great. I think you should continue doing that and maybe one day become a therapist. So I started like helping people figure themselves out when I came back from India the first time and felt like I understood everything in the world. And at the age of 21, I sort of became like, I was a camp counselor, but I would like help younger kids and stuff like that. And so like, I started like helping people at the age of 21 and sort of finding my Dharma and I was gonna become a monk and like help people that way. So it's fine that you have that capability. I think if someone needs your help, you should try to help them. But be a little bit careful because like, call it what it is. Is it one sided? Is it friendship? And do they support you in some way? And I think if those things happen, it's not whether you have an emotional conversation with someone and whether you untangle things. That's not what makes something a therapy or a friendship. What makes it a therapy or a friendship is whether it's one sided or two sided. And also like whether you're actually trying to like help them fix a long standing like psychological issue. Because if you are doing that, chances are even though you think you're helping, you may be a little bit out of your depth and you may actually be like doing them a disservice because they may be getting emotional band aids from you without ever like exploring it with someone who's more competent than you are. Maybe you're competent and you can help them in that way. I'm not saying that you aren't, but that's something that you've got to think about, right? Like if they're calling you every week, like crying about their problems, maybe it's time to have a conversation with them about like, hey, is this like, what's going on between us? Like I'm happy to support you, but like I feel like every week we have this conversation. I'm happy to have this conversation for the next couple of months every week if you want to. But I'm wondering, is there something else, like I care about you, is there something else that we could do to like really help you with this? Or do you feel like this is enough? So I think in my experience, I prefer friends who kind of overstep and then I can be like, this is kind of more than I need from you, as opposed to friends who are afraid of kind of getting their hands messy, because it shows you care, right? Like if you're willing to take that on. And I think in my strongest friendships are all ones where we've kind of played therapists, but for a little while. And you kind of have to recognize like, hey, this has been going on for like a month or two for now. Have you thought about seeing somebody? It's funny. Sorry, I got distracted, I was reading Twitch chat. Okay, they're funny. Wondering when actual insults came. So I have a crazy idea guys, I know sorry for derailing you, hun. It's okay. I have a crazy idea that there's no such thing as a true incel, that a potential incel. It's like the true, the myth, it's like actually a unicorn. Cause what happens when we get insults on streams, they turn out to be decent people. What happens when we get dudes with waifus on streams, they turn out to be decent people. Like, oh, it's crazy guys. It's almost as if all of these like constructions that we make about people, oh, people are just people. Who? Great. But if there is a real incel out there, I'm waiting for you. Okay. You can have Adam, but are there times that you feel like you've been my therapist? Or played that role? No. Why? Cause I mean, you give me plenty of support, right? So where's that line? Yeah, I don't think I've ever been your therapist. Yeah, I don't think so either. So like, here's why. So like, cause I'm personally invested in your relationship. Right. So like, when like a therapist, as a therapist, when someone comes in with like, let's say a marital conflict, I'm a hundred percent on their side, but I can't ever be a hundred percent on your side because I have to protect my side. I protect your side. I know. And I protect your side, but like I can't, with therapists, it's like, I'm a hundred percent on their side. Like I can't ever be, you know, in terms of our conflict. I think this applies to others too, right? Like there's a point at which like, you know, I might be waiting out of my element here, but even like for substance abuse stuff, right? You're gonna have your friends that like do that with you and it's sometimes against their interest or their side to like encourage you to get sober. Right. So I think you also have to decipher like where other people's interests are to see where and when that advice is worth taking. You know what I just realized? Tell me. I never watch lower stream. Low stream is really good. Is that? Yeah. Okay. I really like watching Twitch chat react to our stream, but I just, it's kind of weird, but I don't watch it, but it's actually pretty fun. All I know is when I lean my head, I get head leans. When I put on my glasses, everybody types glasses. So it's like a weird. No, no, no. I'm not talking about myself. I'm talking about you guys responding to her. Like that's entertaining shit. It is. No, I'm not talking about my content. I'm talking about like y'all's content. This interaction is, it's fun to watch. Okay. Oh my God. I can't imagine how bored I would be if I was just listening to myself rant and soap box. One day maybe if I get good enough at this, you'll understand. I think you have that potential. Oh yeah. I thought potential was a construct. Yeah. You have the potential to be me one day. Oh no. Okay. World only needs one. So I think maybe we'll do one more question and then we'll transition to Twitars. We'll take a quick break and then, or I mean, you can keep going if you want, but I need to pee. Me too. Transition to Twitars. We've drank a lot of water. How do you choose, do you want, are we doing booze? How do you choose? We should do booze. We should do 100K. We have done this. Let's celebrate. How do you choose a path that is financially more stable and might turn into a passion, but you don't know fully and something you enjoy, but money isn't great doing it? For example, I'm going into computer science and know nothing about it and I'm starting at level zero. I also have a lot of experience with personal health and training, but I think it might be more of a hobby than my true calling. Yeah, financial security, I think, is the heart of this question, right? Like, how do you make that transition if you don't have like a financial fallback? Is that, that's what I got out of it. What did you get out of it? I'm a little bit brain dead, but what I kind of got is that like, so if you're interested in fitness and personal health, I think like we've been saying earlier, like the two aren't mutually exclusive, right? So if you like computer science, then go for it. And then, you know, you can still do fitness and health. Like that's gonna be important. Like you don't think that when you end up working at one of these, what are you trying to do? Just tell me what you're trying to do. I'm trying to make sure that what you're talking about is not what he wants to hear. And I have just confirmed that that is not. This isn't about personal health. Don't talk about med school anymore. What? No, it is, it's a question. It's about financial stability. Like how do you make that transition? How do you choose a path that is financially more stable might turn it into a passion, but you don't know fully in something you enjoy, but money isn't great doing it? This is what I'm starting with. I also have a lot of experience with personal health and training, but think it might be more of a hobby than my true calling. That's why I'm talking about personal health. Okay. So, so like, you know, if you are interested in personal health and training and you're like majoring in ComSci because ComSci is gonna get you a job, I don't think that those two are mutually exclusive. And like, if it's a hobby, that's great. And like, I, you know, cause like, for example, there are fitness apps, right? Like if you were designing a fitness app, do you think you would design? So let me put it this way. Would an app developer who understands fitness do a better job at designing an app than an app developer who doesn't understand fitness? Maybe yes, maybe no. The second thing is, is someone who wants to make a fitness app who owns a gym, gonna be better equipped to make a fitness app than someone who understands programming, right? So I think that like fitness and technology are like really, really in line right now. You know, could you learn how to code like a heart rate monitor or something else, right? Like there's a lot of stuff around technology and fitness that go hand in hand. And the last of which is if you enjoy programming and then you end up working for a company that's like, you know, you're a programmer and there are a bunch of fucking programmers around who like spend their free time on Twitch, drinking Mountain Dew and eating Cheetos. Like maybe you can teach them something about fitness. I want Cheetos. Okay, so I got the financial stability question and I think this is a really hard and really good question because we had financial fallbacks that let us do what we're doing. And when you don't have that, it is absolutely, if you have to like focus on the rent, if you have to focus on your bills, that's why I think people should be able to get non-student loans. Like I'm not a student. I'm not, I don't wanna learn, I just wanna try. So I think you can, if you wanna start a business, try to at least get it started and look into things like SBIR grants, which will fund small business. The one thing I have learned is that there are so many resources available in this world that people just have no idea about. So look for things like, if you have a calling, try to figure out how you can make it a real thing and not just a hobby. Are they just chatting about chips now? Yeah, I don't think there's a Cheeto emote. So Doritos it is. And they're doing Doritos. Man, Brita Lay get on it. Sponsorship opportunity. I will eat Cheetos for money. This I will do. So I think creating that financial fallback, you can either try to save up for it and take stuff on. I think Upwork and those kinds of platforms are really good ways to kind of wade into freelance world and try to get some extra money while seeing if you're good at it. So you can try to create like a side hustle that way. You can also, if a side hustle isn't the right way for you, if like trying to save up more, if you're already working crazy long hours and don't have more bandwidth for that, I think you can also have really honest conversations with whoever you are employed with to, yeah, chips, about things like advances or bonuses or other ways you can kind of restructure that arrangement. There are resources in the discord by the way about how to do this. Another thing that you could probably do is, this is risky, but you could ask to go from like an employment status to a contractor status because that will let you take home more of your actual paycheck and will help you phase out into something else. And that way, like your employer sees it coming, you kind of can put yourself on like a six month contract or something like that with your work and try to move into something else. And if it doesn't work, then you've already been there and you can try to go back. It's super risky, but if you're some, so I work best under pressure. If you're someone like that, the risk can actually help light a fire under your ass. If you're not like that, then that's not the right way for you, but look for money or save money, preferably do both. And I think there's ways you can tackle either side. Do you just want to watch chat react to random shit? No, I just, Who's streaming what? I heard the phrase employment status to contractor status. And it's like one of those things where I just like, it sounds like what you said was really important and really helpful. And I just couldn't, I was reading Twitch chat and I even tried closing my eyes, but I saw Twitch chat with my eyes closed. So what she said was probably really important. I'd pay attention to it, but I have nothing else to say. Okay, let's take a break. We're going to go grab a drink and we'll see you guys back in a minute. Muted, Boomer, Boomer, muted, Boomer. Okay, Twitter. So let's see, how do I find Twitter questions? Twitter. Did you guys, do you all do that? Okay. Oh, Moses was telling me to tell you guys to stop donating as we were hitting close to 100K. Moses was furiously DMing me on Discord. Okay, I'll tell you guys to stop. Okay, how do I find Twitter? Hold on, let's see if Dr. K can do it by himself. Okay, I found our Twitter. Hold on. Twitch, can you guys help me with this? Oh, here we go. Okay, great. So Zach, do you wanna, aha. Okay, found it. Okay, let's keep going. Mrs. K will be with us in a moment. Okay. Okay, after Twitter, okay. Cool, man. Thanks, Zach. So I got a quiet, well-paying job. Let me see if I can do this. Let's just do this one. So I got a quiet, well-paying job right after uni, graduated three years later than my peers. But it doesn't really push me to learn anything. If I quit outside my current job, I have zero value and I'm not even scared because 75% of my current salary goes to the bank account and I can live. I can live off it several years if needed. Comfort and avoidance, effort type procrastination prevent growth. I avoid any outside pressure and good at it. And I'm not internally motivated, I'm not internally motivated to do anything. I live to get by, never experienced wellbeing, so I can't strive for it. So I'm on the way to... So I'm on the way to have harder and worse paying jobs as time passes. This is really confusing. Why are you on the way to have harder and worse paying jobs? Okay, so let's start with this, okay? One second, okay. So first of all, good for you for graduating three years later than your peers and still putting your life together and not getting bent out of shape because you're quote unquote later. See, there's the comparison. And it sounds like now that you have your needs met, you're not inspired to do anything extra. And that makes a lot of sense, right? So if we think about this... I forgot what email he got. Thank you. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers, guys. Thank you. Okay. Sorry, is it a little strong? Shut up. Foul concoction. Sorry. Oh my God. I feel like the strength should be called the devil's diabetes. It's made with Coke Zero. Oh my God. No. No, no, no, I'm glad you made it. I mean, it's like better than what I would have made. Don't let my disgust with the beverage be interpreted as any amount of lack of appreciation for you. You're awesome. It's just the devil's diabetes is the devil's diabetes. Like what, you know, you just came up with an idea and you're like, oh, I'm gonna drink Coke Zero. I'm gonna drink Coke Zero. I'm gonna drink Coke Zero. You know, you just came up with a new drink in school. It's like lots of alcohol, zero calories. It's Coke Zero, tastes awful. It's a lemon, yeah. Lemon really does help. Sponsorship opportunity. Seriously, Frito-Lay, Coca-Cola, where are y'all? Okay. Because now we actually have to do this thing. Now we actually are doing this coaching thing. No, no, I mean, we were doing this coaching thing anyway. Yeah. We've been doing it. No, I know. But like now we've got, we're gonna have, almost 400 of you guys are gonna be able to work with a coach within a month. And I'm so excited about that. But I wanna get to where we can help 10,000 people. Someone's telling me to kiss you. You wanna do something? No, that's okay. Some things we keep private. Okay, so this person's question on Twitter. So has a quiet, well-paying job, doesn't really push you to learn anything. If he's making money, storing it in a bank account, doesn't really know what to strive for. Basically, it seems like he's complacent, he or she. So 200K goal kiss. No, we're not gonna just have more and more stretch goals. We're really happy for everything you guys have done. We're good, yeah. Anything on top of this, we mentioned this before, but I definitely wanna say it again, is just gonna go to subsidizing free services and padding the scholarship fund. So if you wanna contribute, it will not be wasted. But we're done asking you guys for money. Yep, right, so I mean, we're done. You have given enough, right? And we're very, very grateful for that. But yeah, so just going back to this person's question. So I think it's important to recognize that sometimes when you have your needs met, it's hard to move forward in life, right? And this is where, because a lot of times it's... I'm getting distracted by... Okay, I'll take over. What is the question? They want you to kiss them. Is that why you're distracted? Yes, because I do want to kiss them. I know you do. I really wanna hug everyone in general. This is why he wants to do the retreat. This is why I wanna do the retreat, because I want to weep with all of you. It's gonna be so touchy. It's gonna be a lot of touching, a lot of feeling. You can sleep alone, because you're gonna be covered in corona. Canora virus. Canora virus. Our two-year-old calls it the canora virus. Canora, canola. Okay, I can't read this thing. But it doesn't have to be a clip. 75% of my... Yeah, I feel like I know a lot of people in this position. Quiet, well-paying job. They're financially very comfortable. Just kind of nothing to live for, nothing to do. And if they leave this job, no, it's not like they know where they would go. Is that the gist of it? I think so. Yeah. So thoughts on how to respond? Yeah, so it sounds like... It sounds like kind of a lack of purpose, right? And I think volunteering is a good thing to do. And also one of the things that I have been really grateful for from my friends in this position is their advice and mentorship and guidance on Healthy Gamer. So if you wanna help a friend out that might be wanting to start something or do something or go out on their own, be that person, be that financial safety net for them. I'm like such a huge believer in just sharing the wealth. So I think that's a really good place to do that. Invest in a friend, invest in a person, invest in an idea, invest in a cause, do something good for the world. You know who else is good with sharing the wealth and investing in a cause? Who? Twitch chat. Yeah. Yeah. I thought you were gonna be like, another person wants me to pay for their tuition. I thought that's where that was going. No, no, no. No, no, no, it's Twitch chat, dude. Yeah, y'all are awesome. Twitch chat is the real hero. Yeah. Yeah. So here's what I'd say. I'd really wonder what this person, so practically, right? So this is supposed to be advice. So practically I'd wonder who do you hang out with? Yeah. Because I think a lot of complacency comes from your peers. Yep. And so are you around people who think and wanna be better and grow? Are you basically around office drones? Or do you just have your friends that you game with? Because they're not gonna pull you forward. I think this person needs to try to find people who challenge and inspire them and get them to ask questions and think about things and engage them intellectually. Because this person sounds like, intellectually, they're starved. And so really think about who you hang out with. And can you hang out with people who are curious about stuff and really make you think about like something else? And this kind of goes back to, I think, a big symptom of our problem in this society, which is that we make goals that are based on careers and financial stability to the exclusion of personal growth or karma or anything like that. And I think it's good to have financial goals and try to be secure and stuff like that. Like we've said to you guys before, we started with this and, Kruthi, spot on, that it was okay. Because I started out with a goal of financial security and we were gonna do Healthy Gamer in a way where we could support it. Because I literally, no one has done this before. We did this for months without any kind of fundraising or anything like that. And we weren't planning on fundraising. And so financial stability is a fantastic place to start. So in a sense, this person feels like they're at the end of their road to me, but you're not at the end of your road. You're actually at the beginning of your road. You're complacent because you've like, no, dude, you're just starting. Now you've built your base and you have your economy running and then you can actually start to grow and expand. And so the question is, how do I figure out what to grow and expand towards? And so then what you need to do is surround yourself with people who like care about shit. And as you surround yourself with people who care about things, hopefully you'll move forward. You're not thinking, like this person has a problem and I say, like a problem with lack of thought. It's a lack of inspiration. They're searching for inspiration. I think they're actively trying to figure out how to search for inspiration. And I think changing your social circle is a good way to do that. Yep. So in my case, what happened, so it's interesting. Hopefully this doesn't come across as egotistical, but like literally I found myself at Harvard Medical School and I was like, holy shit, these guys like really, they're fucking tryhards. And I was like, maybe I should try hard too. Being surrounded by tryhards is like, I mean, it can be toxic in some ways, but I really kind of took it as inspirational. And I have like other friends. So one of my buddies started a mental health startup while he was still in med school before residency. Another one of my friends like after residency moved out to California and she's doing her startup. And like when you're surrounded by people who like are trying to do things and make things, it gets you working. Right. And it gets you like, there's also, so I found this a lot when I went from startup life to kind of like corporate life where people are, when you're around a lot of risk averse people that just kind of want to put in their time and get out and go do something else, that can rub off on you too in a really bad way. So I mean, I think, especially if you're young, definitely save up. Definitely have like a Roth IRA and a 401k. Like I worry about this generation a lot because you don't, first of all, you don't know what resources there are. Second of all, you get dinged on fees left and right. And third, you guys aren't financially savvy enough to know where to put your money. And it's not, there are ways to kind of grow your money to create those kind of financial safety nets for you in the future. So if you do want to start something in the future, you can. It's not going to be like millions of dollars, but it'll be enough for like three months, four months rent. Okay. So wasted seven to eight years in Dota 2. Now my 23 year old bought that ADHD ass, someone's been paying attention, has responsibilities. I've actually thought a lot about things and gotten a lot of help from watching your channel, but I haven't been able to do any concrete work on my situation and my goal of living independently. I felt empowered when I learned that my strength lies in managing as many things as I can while failing at none, but I start as a master planner and can't quite follow through on things. Please advise me on how to work and on it and also on deciding what to commit to. Thoughts? I mean, you're the Vata, I work very differently. So I think the problem here, so I'm going to go ahead and copy pasta this, okay? Okay. Copy pasta. Okay. Okay. So I felt empowered when I learned that my strength lies in managing as many things as I can while failing at none, but I start as a master planner and can't quite follow through, okay? I'm gonna highlight that. I haven't been able to do any concrete work. Okay, so let's look at this for a second, okay? So the problem isn't follow through, the problem seems to be starting. So there's a big difference between planning, starting and finishing. And when I see this sentence, I haven't been able to do any concrete work on my situation. I think you've got planning and you think that the problem is follow through, but oddly enough, what I want you to do is actually start stuff and go ahead and fail them. Like I think it's better for this person to start in abandon compared to plan and not start. So what I would love to see this person do is actually start a bunch of things and then not follow through, but at least start them. So you'd rather they cancel. Yep. I'd rather them fizzle out, get good at starting and fizzling out and then try to bring balance and follow through into it. Does that make sense? Like just gotta get started. This person isn't started. When they say, I can't do concrete work. Yeah, because you're planning and you're concerned about not following through because in the path you haven't followed through and that's what keeps you from getting started. Whereas what, like each of these are discrete like psychological or neuroscientific skills. Starting a task and overcoming procrastination is a different psychological or mental skill from staying on top of a task and seeing it through to completion. So don't confuse the two and just get started. And when you say you have a plan, so I'd say like take one of your plans and break it down into like what's the last step and this is kind of cool. So don't start with the first step. What is the last step before your plan is complete? And then go to the step, okay, what needs to be done before you do that? And then what needs to be done before you do that? And what needs to be done before you do that? And at some point you have to ask yourself, can I do this today? And if the answer is no, then go back. What do I need to do before I can do something today? And then you work yourself backwards to the first thing that you need to do. Can you do this today? And when you find the thing that you can do today, you do it today. I think there are some specific things though that you do, right? Like when you settle into like your admin work and stuff like that, you turn on music, you eat light because you don't wanna get sleepy. There are like some specific things that you do to kind of get into like the, just bang it out mode, right? As a vata. I'm sorry, I wasn't paying attention. What? So as this person's a vata. I'm already tipsy. There's not that much in it. Okay. I'm lightweight. Whatever. So if you're a vata, these are things that have worked for him in particular. So he listens to music, he shuts himself off, right? Like no interruptions. He doesn't check his phone. He also plans to, when he settles in, he's like, I'm just gonna like watch a replay or I'm just gonna like, he just watches Dota for like 15, 20 minutes. And then he starts, right? So you kind of settle into that flow state. He also does this thing where he like won't eat too heavy because then he'll get sleepy. So if you're trying to like get into like a mode where you're like just executing, executing, executing, those are a couple of things that he does. I'm so temperamental and finicky. I'm telling you, like he's the most high maintenance person in like I've ever met. And then he like gets on our kids because like they're so picky. Oh man, I'm so hard to live with. You don't eat. Love you. No, I love you too. Okay, all right. Kind of a diva. Okay. So yeah, so I'd say like focus on getting started and then fail a couple of times and then you'll figure out and follow through after. But do these very specific things to like try to get into a flow state. Okay. How do you deal with pressure to choose profession to follow being at 18 or 19 years old? Don't do it. It's a trap. Just don't do it. Just pick something. Just pick something that sounds good to you at the time. And then everybody else happy and then do what you want. Yeah. And like you don't have to, you don't have to commit to a profession. Commit to oppression. Commit to a profession at 18 or 19 years old. That's silly. That's bullshit. Yeah, I majored in neurobiology and I started my career at the age of 27 or 28. I want to be a fucking political journalist. And look at where she is now. Right? Not a political journalist. I thought you wanted to do like political strategy. Yeah, because political journalists make shit money. I'm really glad I'm not a political journalist right now, but I'm a political person. And so when healthcare pisses me off, I get to do something about it. You guys are keeping track of the DLCs, right? Cause I forgot. Are you going to do drunk DLCs? Absolutely do. Drunk DLC is best DLC. Hello, Dr. K. I had, as you say, an easy life. My parents who love and support me and had big suffering in the past. Right now I'm studying economics, psychology and discovered through you that I love helping and inspiring people. I would love to work as a coach in companies in the future. The problem I'm having is I don't know how to get the skills I need to become a coach. Can I take this one? And also I don't know how to really help people. I see it as my dharma. Okay. This is like, when you have somebody's attention, do not ask them something that you can Google yourself. Like do a little homework before you ask kind of general questions. I get this all the time where people are like, I can, you know, I want to apply for a coach. Where do I do that? Like just look on the website for like a second. You know, like try. And then when you, if you email me and you say, I have looked at the website, I want to be a recovery coach. I think I have these skills. Would this be good? That is going to go so much further, but don't waste somebody's time and attention on something you can easily Google. I mean, okay. I think it's a legit question, man. Hold on a second, okay? Okay. Before you roast this guy back to the Stone Age. So he says, I would love to work as a coach in companies in the future. Like, I don't think he wants to- To become a coach. Yeah, but he's not talking about necessarily about us. No, that wasn't what I was saying. So what is he supposed to Google? How to become a coach. Okay, let's Google it. You got a screen share? We are screen shared. Oh, hey, it's the IOC. What are the requirements to become a coach? Okay, fair enough. Right, we just Google things. So if you guys, so this is where I sort of work. So I'm faculty at, you know, Harvard Medical School in McLean Hospital and McLean has a coaching Institute. It's good SEO, but I'm not a coach. I'm a coach. McLean has a coaching Institute. It's good SEO on their part. Okay, fair. Fair. Okay, so I'm gonna try to answer the question anyway, because I remember what it was like to be that person. He's had an easy life. He's had no major suffering and he had a chance to get a real question answered by you. So I- I'm with you, okay? I'm with you in the sense that if you're asking someone a question, it really helps to do your homework ahead of time. Cause I get all kinds of like, hair, brain questions. And we answer a fuck ton of them. And we probably shouldn't, fair enough. But like, I'll tell you guys this. If you guys like ask me a question, if you have done thought or research, like I'm gonna be much more prone to help you than if it's like something you could Google. So I'm with you there. I'm with her. At the same time, I think that like, becoming a coach is sort of, it's like sort of an unclear landscape, right? So like, I would say that if you wanna help people and you wanna become a coach, there are a lot of different avenues that you can do. So if you wanna work with us, you can sign up with us. But coaching is an emerging profession. You can go sort of the psychology route. So you can become like a therapist. You can go to social work school, get a PhD, become a medical doctor or a psychiatrist. Or you can go to institutes like the Institute of Coaching. And there are different programs that are run by the ICF or International Coaching Federation, which accredits certain programs. Some of these things are scams. And so, that's how you can become a coach. I think if you wanna help people, that's awesome, dude. I think you should help people. And if you guys are interested in, yeah. I don't know, that's what I have to say. I feel like you were a little bit. I mean, the guy's just trying to help people and he's like, he's been giving, he's been given everything in life. So he doesn't know how to Google things. So I would say start doing your own Googling. Good answer, good answer. Okay. All right, I may get some hate. I have a well-paying job, job is cool, live in a foreign country. I was bored of my home country. I'm grateful for my current situation. Being raised by a single mom wasn't easy. Yet I feel stuck, demotivated, et cetera. I'm not sure why. Should I travel or? Yes, travel. Okay, so I'm gonna offer some general advice because I think this is important. If you guys just feel a general lack of motivation, you should maybe like work with someone else to help you get to the bottom of that shit. Okay, okay, let her in, let her in. Umma, let her in. I think I've been hoping that. Hi. Hey, you don't have to cry. Come on. Do you have a cry with Britney? We don't cry. Truth is absolutely, but she scoffed a bit though. Good catch, Twitch chat. We asked. Continually impressed. Where is that little heavy baby? Hey. Where is that little heavy baby? Where is that little heavy baby? Where are the heavy babies, are there? She was amazed because we have. That's right. There are two heavy babies? Watch this. A is four. Hey, what happened to your nose? A is four. She's got like all these injuries. Yeah, because her fingernails and the mosquitoes. Heavy, A is four. Thank you. Okay, no, that didn't go anywhere. All right. So if you guys are struggling with like a lack of motivation, I think it's not like, you know, I think it's worthwhile to spend some time exploring that with someone. So either see a therapist or, you know, like find our coach, find a coach, because like that's what we're trying to help people with. And try to get a sense of like, why is it that you've, like, I want you guys to just look at this first, okay? So, okay, like, so we're gonna play a game Twitch chat. And I want you guys to tell me, what do you guys think this person, what do you think this person should talk about, okay? Like, what should this person focus on with a coach or a therapist? Can you guys tell what the important sentences that may reveal the person's source of lack of motivation? Okay. Hey. Hey. Here. What do you think? I think it might be, he was born in his home country, so he went to a foreign country and is still kind of not feeling something. Okay, let me put it this way. What statement in this tweet is out of place and does not belong in the tweet? Raised by single mom. Beautiful. Abbie. Did you know mommy can be- Right? It's like, why is that? So I think you've got to like dig into that. So I want you guys to understand that motivation is like an emergent thing, right? So like motivation happens when you are functioning well. If you guys have psychological weights, like inspiration happens when your mind is like functioning well and you like have the freedom to be inspired. If you're worn down and you've been grinded to like a knob, like you can't be inspired, right? So I want you guys to think a little bit about this. If you guys are lacking motivation or inspiration, you need to really think about what is it that grinds you down and prevents you from like kindling that flame? It's like a flame that gets extinguished by shit on top. So if- You want me to take care of that? I'm kind of trying to say something. We can switch in. Okay, I'll finish and then I'll take care of it. Okay, so if you're lacking motivation, first unburden yourself, right? Like first like sort through, like when you say it wasn't easy being raised by a single mom and you've done well, go ahead and work on that. Like think through that, like unburden yourself with that because you don't have to carry that shit around again. And then once you're free of that, then you can fly. Like you're not weighed down anymore. Like don't be encumbered and move around at 25% movement speed, bro. Let go of that. And then like motivation will find you. Okay. All right, I think we're gonna do, I think those are the tweets. So, okay, great. Thanks, hon. Is Quinn in here? Quinn, what's up CCNC? Quinn, what's up CCNC? Quinn, what's up CCNC? Quinn, what's up CCNC? Okay. What are we doing? We're doing, I think we're doing calls with Moses. Also no subtext on these questions. I don't know what that means. We're gonna just call him. Let me switch to speakers so you can hear. I just realized that all this time I've had headphones on. Oh, I didn't have headphones. Hey. Do you want to do health figure first? It just depends on whether people want me to be more inebriated or less inebriated during the healthcare rant. So maybe poll number three. My hair is in my face. Can I put it back? Yes, always. You want to see an email, Dr. K? No, I've done this for them before. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I've done this for them before. I popped my collar and was playing Dota with an Indian accent. Okay. This is Hiro. Hiro, okay. Let's do good boy, Dr. K. What? Good boy. What are you doing to me? I'm hurting you here. Are you taking away my dignity? I don't know. Oh, middle part? Yeah. Oh God, please not the middle part. No, no. Anything but the middle part. Sorry. Does Twitch chat know our rule about facial hair? No, but you can tell them if you want to. Sorry, one time I asked Ruthie if I could grow a beard and she says, if you get to grow it, I get to grow it. Because Indian people are hairy, including Indian women. All right, Moses, what's on deck, bro? I'm actually asked a good question. Effectively working as a capa pitta? Okay, so a lot of things are gonna piss you off, like a lot. And the things that you have to do is channel that anger productively. So, like I would always get really frustrated by people who are like, like I would always get really frustrated by process and inefficiency. And like, if somebody says they're gonna do something by Friday and then Friday at noon, you know, they're like, can I, I just need until Tuesday. And you're like, if you need until Tuesday, tell me like before the deadline. So I would get really frustrated. And I think, I think the key to some of that for me was saying like, okay, this isn't working. How do we fix this? This isn't working, how do we fix it? And go from the person that's just yelling at everybody to the person that is like not afraid to fix the stupid problems that nobody else wants to fix. Can anybody hear me or is this just busted? No, I think you're audible. I think the sound was, can they hear me now? I think they should be able to hear you. That's more of the, I fixed it. That is right, that is more the fit that, but guffa in me is just like, oh, there's too much to do. I'm gonna just go to sleep. And for that, I'm not even kidding. Changing my diet helped me become, I'm more fit than now than I was guffa because I eat way more meat and way less dairy than I used to. I also eat like consistently spicy foods, but that has definitely put me more in the fit category, but I'm way more fit than I used to. Way more productive this way. But like when I have a more guffa heavy diet, like I just wanna veg out, watch my shows. I'm not really motivated. And it's, that's frustrating for the fit side of me because I have my task list in my head for everything that I need to do. So if you're guffa dominant, I would watch your diet. And if you're fit, if you're fit the dominant, move that anger into being productive. Like what can I fix instead of like, what sucks about everyone? Can I share something that I think? So I think the other thing about guffa bit is that they sit on their anger, right? So guffas tend to propagate longer situations that are bad because of their inherent resilience. So it's like guffas because of their high HP pool can just sit there in poison. And just take damage every turn. And they're like, I got a big HP pool so I don't need to move anytime soon. So guffa bit does feel anger, but then also like sit in it for a while. And that like, is they stew. So they like let things like build up and stew and it gets worse and worse and worse and worse and worse. And then they like explode. So really try to process what's happening to you throughout the day and like work on it more proactively. What's next Moses? Cool. Do you have any tips for how to ask for a raise? No, none for you. That's why I said these questions don't have sub decks. It's important for our audience, okay? Never ask for a raise. All right. If you have really, I think it's important for you to constantly demonstrate your value. Without asking for a raise. So when people are like, when you do ask for a raise, there's all this value that you've contributed. So a couple of my favorite ways to do this are to send subject line emails. So things like the subject line is, we just crossed 100K. And then I would be the boss, right? And I would forward that to everyone and say like, yes, we were doing it. And then, you know, they see where that came from or send emails that are like, coaching program is live and I see where that came from. Or, you know, just got a big content partnership deal. Like, and like, tell us what you're doing. And your boss will see the dollar figures attached to that. Like, saved this amount of money, got this amount of revenue, saved this amount of like, you know, man hours and whatever process it was. And I, yes, click bait in real life, do that shit. Because your boss is gonna forward it to their boss. And I think the extent to which you can make your boss's life easier is going to be the extent to which your boss is gonna go to bat for you. And when you ask for a raise, don't position it as asking for a raise. Position it as your future at this company. Yeah, so I'm gonna presume for a second that we're not talking about our relationship with Moses. And so it's a good question, right? Like, how do you ask for a raise? So just like real examples. I don't know what you guys do. I don't know what your living situations are. So here's what I'd say. So a lot of times you have a job description. And what I think you should do, so like generally speaking, the way that you ask for a raise is you have a performance review on a certain amount of time. And there's a separate discussion about like accelerating performance reviews. So you can ask for raises earlier, but let's assume that you have a performance review once a year. So here's the way that you ask for a raise. So you take a list of your job, what? Don't listen to, do not ask for a raise in your performance review. Okay, fine. So here, fine. I think my point still stands. So there's nothing to change, okay? So here's what I think you should do. Like oftentimes your bosses will, like when you get hired for a job, there's like a job description, right? So I'm like talking about, generally speaking, like a corporate or well-structured organization. So they have like processes for performance reviews and raises. And usually what happens if you work for like a middle manager, like they have to get the raises approved by the upper managers. So what you wanna do is you wanna take your job. And so basically for you to get a raise, you need to be able to make a strong case and furthermore equip your direct report to make a strong case for their direct report, right? Cause like they have to clear the raises by their boss. So that's sort of what I'm assuming. So if that structure doesn't apply to you, then like, you know, take this with a grain of salt. So when you get hired for a job, you've got a job description. So you take that job description and you put it in a word document. And then like as you're, throughout the year, you're gonna do a lot of things that are outside of that job description. And the week that you do them, you make a note of it. So you keep that in a document and you kind of say like, okay, this week, like my job description is to, you know, filter patients through the ED. And on this week, this person was like missing. So I ended up doing this work and then I ended up doing this work. And eventually you sort of end up doing things that are outside of your job description. And I think when Ruthie says, demonstrate your value to the company, the key thing is that when you do that, you should keep track of it. Yes. I'm not saying that you should get taken advantage of by the man. I'm saying if you do something for the man that the man is not paying you for, you write it down somewhere. Right, the man owes you, this is his tab. So the next thing that you do is in terms of the stuff that you do for your job description, you write down how you have executed on that with as many numbers as possible. So what you do is you kind of say like, okay, here are the first six months of where I worked, where we processed 50 patients in a four hour period in the emergency room. After I came on, we've processed 56 patients in a four hour period in the emergency room. And then what happens when you go into your performance review, you have everything laid down. And then you take your document and then you like trim it up and you clean it up and you say, hey, I think I deserve, and if you don't do this during the performance review, that's fine. Yeah, I don't know anything about that. But then you go to them and you say like, here are the reasons why I believe like I'm doing, like I deserve more money. And then if they say, oh yeah, we're sorry, we can't pay you. And then you turn around and you ask them the question. So I just wanna understand. In the future, I did all of these extra things. In the future, so it sounds like you guys can't afford me to pay for this stuff. So it helped me understand if you want me to continue doing this stuff in the future, is it a part of my job or is it not a part of my job? So in the future, if you ask me to do something and it's not a part of my job or I'm not getting compensated for it, like do I have the right to say no? It's kind of a dickish move, can piss some of your bosses off, but I'm a little bit tipsy. And I think like you should lay it out to them that you are doing work that you're not getting compensated for. Or rewarded for when you do it well. Yeah, and just lay it out for them and just be like, okay, so like you guys are asking me to do stuff that's not a part of my job. So I just wanna understand, are you expecting me to do this going forward? Because it's not a part of my job. And then you put it to them, you're not saying like, I'm not gonna do it, you're not throwing a hissy fit. You're just asking them to like put their money down on whether you're doing something extra or not. Right? The people that I know that have gotten the best raises are the people that consistently demonstrate their value. And it's never a surprise when they ask for more. If the performance review is the first time that you ask for a raise, that budget is already gone, right? Your supervisor should have seen it coming, should know your value, should have already made that case for you. And your performance review should basically be the closure, the final step to solidify whatever that raise is. Good advice. And I also think that asking for title bumps is probably gonna be more effective than a raise. So if you are just wanting a raise, right? That means I want more money to do the same thing. But if you want a different title, that's when the stuff that Olloc is talking about comes into play. I'm also doing this, I'm also doing this. I'm doing a lot of this. I'm doing it well. It's bringing in value. I think my title should include that. I think this would be the appropriate salary bump. And then you can go from there. So she brings up a really good point. I think the other thing is that you say that in terms of the title bump, the way you justify it is that you kind of say that I'm doing things that are actually not a part of my job description. So I would like a title that's commensurate. I have to do them. Yep. And so what you're asking your boss to do is just lay out, let's get all on the same page about what I'm doing for you and what I'm not doing for you and what you're paying me for and what you're not paying me for. And then let's get on the same page about, are you gonna start paying me for this stuff? And if you're not gonna start paying for me, you're not allowed to be upset if I stop doing it. We're no longer here about doing it well. I think there's a distinction to be made there because every company wants somebody that's gonna fill in the gaps and be happy to fill in those gaps. Those are the most valuable people in any company. But people that do that and then withhold it, I don't personally want around, right? Because that means that you were a team player and now you're greedy and now you're not. So I would say, how can we get my compensation structure to let me be the most valuable to you guys? Because right now, I'm only bonused if I do this. So that means that if I could support this department, which makes more money, but you're only compensating me to support this other department, I feel like that's not in the best interest of the company. I think that is gonna get you a lot further. And the other thing that you have to do, is impress your boss's boss. And that person is gonna be the person that approves the budget for your raise. That is why the subject line emails are so important because your boss, when you send that to them, they're gonna forward it to his or her boss, right? So then your boss's boss is gonna say, oh, Oleg's doing such a great job. He pulled in 100K for this fundraising month. He has stayed sober on two out of three streams this month. Whatever, then if I send that out to whoever, we don't have any overwords, thank God, right now. But when you send that out, potentially Oleg would get a raise. Would you like a raise? Well, I don't get a salary, so it'd be nice to make a single dollar. You will not. Send me an email. Can I have, like, I don't even wanna raise. Can I just get a salary? No. Let's start there. Okay. How about a dollar or another drink? Maybe, we'll see. No, can I actually have another drink? No, I have brought you mint, I have brought you oranges, I have brought you ice, I have brought you a drink. But you don't pay me anything. Okay, I don't pay myself anything. Get me a drink. Okay, I'll get you a drink. Thank you. But you make them better than I. No, you just said, what did you call it, devil's diabetes? It was delicious. Oh, okay. All right, is anybody else seeing this? Oh, but you know what? You should get drinks with your boss. Socialize. Let them get to know you as a person. Let them be invested in your life and your success. Also, because- Have children with that. No. That's how you get them invested in your life and your success. People wanna raise. Hey, are we gonna raise? Just get your boss pregnant. Except for you. Nothing. That's the way that you tie your boss and your future together is by having children with them. Moses, we're gonna need an HR professional. Need more than that. Yes, you're right. Okay, oh wait, do you really want me to make you drinks? I don't know how you make these. They're so good. Just pour the wine bottle over you. Yeah. Okay, are you sure you don't wanna- Yes, please, I love you so much. All right, I will be back. Also, just beg for shit. Just beg, just beg. If they say no, or if they say it's your turn, just beg. And put on your puppy dog ears, eyes, whatever. Okay, no, really, her drinks are better than mine. I'd just be pouring her a bottle of wine. It's okay, Grichat, I got her something. Can I show you what I got her? Oh, wait, are they gone? Oh, they're gone. What? I didn't say anything. All right, what's the next question? Wait, are you gonna show them the package? Huh? Wait, are you showing them the package? I can't tell, because I can't see anything. Yeah, I'm gonna show them what I got her. Okay, I mean, you can just do that first. Oh, be careful about the address on the thing. Yeah, there's gonna be no address. Oh, okay. I'll open it down here. I don't know if there's glare. Wait, people are saying Lily. No. Oh, that's cool. Yeah. Wait, how did you do it so fast? Anyone else? Nothing, I hear nothing. Come, snap, it's one. Oh, hello, Lily. How are you? She didn't put on extended. Nothing, nothing, nothing. We have a janky fridge that you have to use, the freezer, the freezer. You have to use the freezer trays for right now. Wait, say hi to Lily. She is in our chat. Hey, Lily, how are you? Hey, I'm here. Really, Pichu? How are you doing, Lily? Oh, she's in our chat. I'm waiting for her voice. Lily, thank you so much for kicking this off. Girl, if you don't even know what you've started. This is amazing. Lily was our first donation. Thank you very much, Lily. Okay. All right, so what's next, Moses? Did you guys ask questions about losing your passion for your job? Losing your passion for your job? Yeah. People that have had zero passion to begin with. Dang it. Yeah, I mean, so we can talk about losing your passion. I certainly lost my passion for, especially when you go from startup stage to corporate over-reward stage, that happens a lot. I lost my passion during the stream. So here's the thing to remember, right? So if you lose your passion, you have to look at what other psychological things could be going on that prevent you from feeling the passion that you first felt. So let's just say hypothetically that you were a producer for a Twitch stream, and then you tossed out a crazy promise that if you raised $100,000 over the course of a month, that you would go on an E-date. And then once that absolute fiction becomes a reality, like it can have a psychological consequence that would result in maybe you losing your passion. Hey, am I supposed to take this question seriously? Yeah. Joking aside, if you lost the passion. Yeah, because Zach and I are not gonna take it seriously. Right, I'm getting this. Drink you under the table. I don't wanna- You've been able to drink, the whole reason we're together today is because you drank me under the table 16 years ago. 17. 17. 17. 17. 17. 17. 17. 17. 17. 17. 17. 17 years. Okay, what's the question? 17 years ago in August. Got some big anniversaries coming up, you know that, right? Yep. Okay. That's what the box is for. Oh, sweetie. Yeah, I was showing them your gift because I have to wrap it properly. Because cardboard boxes apparently aren't sufficient for- We're gonna be wrapping you guys. I'll take a picture. I'll show it to you guys. All right, so what are we doing? Oh, wait, answer the question. What do you do after you lost your passion? How do you get it back? How do you recover? Yeah, so I think the three strikes rule is good. Give yourself and the company three chances to get it back. And you gotta specify what that is. So as an example, I was really passionate about this startup that was basically in bar entertainment, in trivia questions and stuff like that. So if you go to a happy hour, this was in Austin. It was a really fun little company that, essentially what they were trying to do was sell in sponsorships to people who wanted to reach bars and restaurants. It's kind of complicated, but. Essentially, it was really fun. The culture was really fun. The product was supposed to be fun. We were supposed to be essentially entertaining people at the bar just to kind of pass the time while they were there. And then it got acquired, and the integration was painful. The kind of new corporate structure was painful. The company became very much about revenue and recurring revenue. And so they wanted to take this thing that to me was very creative and very fun and make it predictable and recurring and process-oriented. And so I definitely, I definitely lost my passion for the creative side. And what I found was I wasn't gonna do this for pennies anymore. So I negotiated a relocation bonus and a title change that basically doubled my salary and doubled my options and came with a relocation bonus. And then for that, I basically got to move my career to New York City. And that was super exciting. So that was a way to kind of reignite my involvement in there. But I think just give yourself a chance and give the company a chance to find the right place for you. Is that good enough? Yeah, I think that was good. All right. Someone was kind of asking you about having the mental fortitude to drive through failing in college and being successful in medical school. And they referred to getting rejected many times. But how do you actually deal with getting rejected because people send out over 100 job applications they don't hear back, right? So like, how do you deal with just like that essentially? So there is actually a cheat code for that, which is that you don't send out 100 job applications. You haven't sent out 100 job applications. You just send out one job application at a time. The cheat code to dealing, to having the fortitude to get through rejection is that you don't look at the long-term, you just look at the short-term. You look at every application on its own. The first application is no different from the second, which is no different from the third, which is no different from the fourth, which is no different from the fifth, which is no different from the hundredth. So I'm not saying that you should ignore data, but I'm saying when it comes to filling out a job application, that's all you should do. When you fill out 100 job applications and you get rejected from 100 of them, then you should sit down with that data with a clear head and change your strategy. So when it comes to filling out the 101st, changing your strategy should inform the way that you do the 101st, but you don't think about the 100 that you've lost before. Right? Does that make sense? Right. Like, because really what's the difference between the 99th and the 101st job application? Right? Like, yeah. I'm not saying you should ignore evidence, but at the same time, don't let your past failures weigh you down. Like every game of Dota that you play is different. It's a new game of Dota. It's not affected by, and so this is actually, forget about Dota for a second. So, you know, if I flip a coin and it's like heads five times in a row, what's the likelihood it's heads on the sixth time? Moses? 50%? Absolutely. Okay, cool. Right? So what's the likelihood that you get five heads in a row over six flips? It's like one divided by two to the sixth pound, right? So like, don't confuse each coin flip with the pattern of one divided by two to the sixth pound. That's the way that you get through it. I also think that changing your strategy is key here. If you don't fall for traps, do not compete in things you cannot win. So what you did was up and move to Boston, start knocking on doors. Yep. And that was way better than filling out, you know, your 170th job application. Because you knew that wasn't a race. Right, so I applied for 130,000. I applied for 130 jobs and got one interview in a city that I wasn't willing to move to. And then like desperate times call for desperate measures. So I just moved to Boston with a suitcase and then like tried to move. Is somebody saying traps everywhere? And I wanna say yes, there are traps fucking everywhere. Don't fall for them. There are traps for your time, for your money, for the way you go about your life. Don't fall for them. Don't do it. Hey, somebody donated 500 bucks after we hit our goal. Strong work, MPR. Thank you. It's all for Gabe at this point, but thank you. All right, Moses, what's next? Oh, follow up questions. Like, did you guys have tips for like kind of getting your foot in the door for like a job? Yes. Go for it. You wanna network with people that before you have something that you want to ask, you wanna build relationships before you ask for something. You never wanna send an email or make a phone call or send a Slack or DM or whatever it is that you guys do. You don't wanna do that and say like, hey, you're such a big fan, love what you do. Can I blah, blah, blah? Don't ask for something in your first communication ever. You always wanna offer that you're there and like the people that I rely on as mentors, I know one day I will be calling in a favor, but the thing is I think one day they're gonna call in favors with me too. And even if the power dynamic is, you know, they're big shits wherever they are and I'm kind of this recent graduate doing this funky thing, there are levels of expertise you can offer just because of being who you are and knowing what you know. And that's not necessarily gonna be conventional wisdom and certainly not gonna be business advice. So I'd say like, if you wanna get your foot in the door, like do your homework. Yes. So I get all kinds of, I'm tempted to even just read. Back to like Google your shit before you ask your question. Don't roast people. No, I'm not gonna roast people. Moses, do you think it's okay if I read like one or two lines of an email without identifying the person? This is actually an email that I got. Yeah, maybe. I have to be able to find it because I got hundreds of these, but. I mean, I get emails that are like, have you ever thought about doing something on motivation? And it's like, yes, I realize. No. You know, I'm like. I've never thought about that. Exactly. Like, have you thought about, you know, doing something? And it's just like the most basic amount of homework. Okay, I can't find the email, but like I got an email once from a dude who like kinda said, hey, why don't we spend some time talking? I'm a smart guy. Why don't we spend some time talking? And then I can tell you how I can help you. I was like. I see shit like that all the time. Like he didn't lay out like what his skills are. And it's like, why the fuck would I spend an hour of my time telling you about what my needs are? So that you can start to make a case to tell me how you can help. The two main ways you can help somebody are by saving them time or saving them money. Like in the business world. So do not send somebody a communication that is gonna cost them time or money. Send them a communication that said, hey, I saw that you're trying to do this thing. I came across whatever. Don't just fucking link them the article and make them read the damn thing. Just be like, I think you should do this. Reference here. Boil things down. Be the person that's gonna save them time and money. And they'll respect your opinion for it and say, hey, I'm thinking about doing this thing. What do you think? So Dr. Jin says, hi, can I has job please? That's actually better than what the email I got was. Yeah. The email that I got was like, why don't you invest your time in helping me figure out what kind of job I can apply for in your company? It's like, what the fuck, man? So like the emails that I respond well to are to the people that have done their homework. Like sometimes I'll get emails from my college kids and they'll be like, hey, like I've watched your stream. I learned A, B and C and I'm trying to do X, Y and Z. And it's clear to me that they've done their homework. And then I feel like helping the kid. Cause it's like, if you've done your homework, like I love to help. Because I remember when I was like, didn't have anyone to help me. And like, I'm not gonna spend my time figuring out how to help someone. But if someone comes to me with a specific question, I'm gonna do my best to help them. Right. Right. And if it's like, people will, and I sort of like, with the clients that I work with, we talk about how to do this, right? So how to do your homework. So that like, there's a huge difference between telling someone, hey, can you help me figure out my life? And laying out in a short amount, like I don't wanna read like a page cause I don't have time for that shit. But hey, I've done X, Y, Z. This is the specific problem that I'm running into. Can you help me with A, B, C? That's how you get your way in the door. So for the people that have worked with us, there are people that have offered us like specific assistance with things that we may need. It's someone who says, hey, like the way that you get your, I love your content. I'm a big fan. I've learned ABC. If you guys ever need help with dot, dot, dot, this specific task, please let me know. And that person goes into a specific folder. They go into a very specific folder of like shit that at some point when we need, that's the first person that we're gonna email. Right. Because they get us. They understand us. They know what we're trying to do. And we know what they can do. Like if you wanna get your foot in the door somewhere, people have to know like what they're bringing in. Like sure you get your foot in the door, but like, why would I invite you in if you're like, hey man, if you ever need help sending up your thondur, like give me a call. And it's like, absolutely man. So like you set your foot in the door and then it's like, if I need help getting my thondur, like I've got a guy. Okay, I might be checking those emails. So the way that you get your foot in the door is by demonstrating first of all, that you know what the fuck these people are doing. Secondly, by offering a particular way in which you can assist them. And Ruthie said it brilliantly. You either offer them, like you either save them money or you save them time. And then like you kind of go from there. I would also encourage you guys to just look at some of the big losers and gainers on like the S&P, the NASDAQ, like you're gonna see who needs help right now. And you're gonna be able to see like, here, let's just do it. Pull up my other finance. All right, the losers on mine right now are JetBlue and Southwest. Let's see. Okay. All right. I'm gonna put them in the thunder. And I still respect what- Yes. Roasted foot. But you're gonna see like some of the comp- I don't know, I don't know if this is gonna be helpful, but if you look at like kind of who's winning and losing in the market, you'll see who the companies are. And they're gonna be people that have like, nobody has ever heard of, right? So there's gonna be some companies that are hot that a lot of people are emailing. Look for the ones that are less sexy because nobody's emailing them. And you're gonna have a way higher chance of getting your foot in the door with them. Yeah, I mean, I think the main thing is like, a lot of people are trying to get the foot in the door. So the thing is that you have to think, put yourself in the shoes of the person who owns the door and ask yourself like, what could they possibly want that I can get them and be really specific about it. And don't start your email apologizing. Do you need something? Okay. Okay. Hello. Take care of it. Okay. Peepo mom, absolutely. Zach, are we, should we move to text to speech man? Yeah, there's actually just like not a lot. Okay, great. Fantastic. So then we can do DLCs. Yeah. Let's do the text to speech. Let's honor the people who have donated. Thank you guys. A DLC is like an extended like rant. I hit that, I don't know. I only know like monologue, soliloquy, those are the words. Soapbox rant. Monologue and soliloquy are fancy words for soapbox and rant. Great. Or soapbox and rant are lowbrow words from monologue and soliloquy. I have a question. Yeah. What does a bio data even look like? Can we look at shobby.com? Can we make like a... Oh no. You're gonna have to join. Yeah. You're interested. You're interested, uh oh. Yeah, it's hard to say. I feel like it's also a privacy violation of the people on here. But if you wanna know, go to like a shobby.com or like indianmatrimony.com. Yeah, I don't know. We'll try to find you one. We have to anonymize one, Moses. Cause I have some in my email from people that have been looking for husbands and wives, but I don't understand them. Oh no. So like usually it's like a picture, your name, your GPA, your interests. So it's like resume, plus like your family members, plus like a picture of you, plus like your hobbies and skills. So like the part that makes you unique and interesting is like the smallest part of it. Yeah. So it's like your astrological sign, your work history, who your parents and siblings are, their work history. And then sometimes you can tell some really interesting stuff from a bio data. Like sometimes they won't list the GPA of the person whose bio data it is, but they'll list the GPA of their sibling. Right. And it's just like really this hard stuff. Like sister, spelling bee winner, 2000. Yeah, it's great. It's great that kind of like, if you want to see like insignificant padding of a resume, just look at bio data. Cause you really will see like spelling bee champion 2005, so and so high school. Like they'll put that shit on there. Yeah. Because you can't put that on a real resume. So it's all the other shit. And it's like, Madeline is 2002, 2010. Yeah. So we got to find, we got to find a bio data. Can we write your bio data? We have to write his bio data. For the thing? Yeah. How else are we going to find him a quality date without writing his bio data? I don't know Tinder. No, it's high quality. It's a range marriage level bio data. Ooh. I'm interested. We're going to put even put our own, we're going to list ourselves as references to the parents. Yeah, so be his parents. You can even stream like you picking the person as like tryouts. That's going to be really fun. Okay. But let's get to our, let's do our text to speech. Or is this all of only? No, this is all of you, dude. This is your, Kruthi's biggest dream is to make a dating bachelor for like non-resident Indians, like arranged marriage reality TV show, where you go to India and then you find your, the love of your life. But instead of you going on like dates where they're taping you, they have your mom go on a date with their mom. And then they tape that to see how they get along. This is what I want. In-laws dating. Yeah. B I O D A T A. Okay. What's, how do I, should I just click the buttons for text to speech, Moses? Yeah. Okay. I got to scroll back two hours, three hours, two days. There we go. Okay. Let's start with this. Okay. I'm not hearing it. Okay. That's okay. I can read it out loud. So like, I think you played them like earlier or something happened. I'm not sure. Yeah. I think I also have them. Pause alert you, skip alert. No. Okay. Okay. So let me just read this out. So, your interview with LS made something I've been working on through a long time flick. My therapy session yesterday was one of the best I've had. Thanks. Awesome, man. So really that's what we're here for, bro. B only 540. Thank you for your $150 donation. You know, so I know that people think that this is therapy, but it's really like a way for you to learn about yourself. And then we highly, highly recommend that you see a therapist about your problems or work with one of our coaches. Cause like- And drive your therapy. Absolutely. Well put. Right? So like, if there's something that you're working on and you can like, you can even dump that on your therapist. Be like, hey, I watched this guy on Twitch and like we talked about this. And like, I was hoping we could, like he talked about this and it resonated with me. I was hoping we could talk about it. And then if your therapist wants to watch it, they can watch it too. Like no big deal. That's awesome. We're here to help you guys learn about yourselves, not as an ends, but as a means, right? For you to start to make a change in your life or discuss it or think about it. It doesn't end like Healthy Gamers, like where you guys should start. It's like watching the Twitch stream is like step one. Yes. And go where you will from there. So Anonymous donated $100. Thank you very much. Tamuja ICBE donated $100. Thank you very much for everything that you do. What am I doing? 14 donated 75 bucks. I feel like it's close enough. Honestly. All of the donations are awesome. Yeah, seriously. Like we feel an obligation to call out some of the higher donors. But the thing that I'm happiest about, Moses, do you have the number of like how many small donations there have been? That's actually the number I'm happiest about. Yeah, so I'm just gonna read a $5 donation question if that's okay with everyone. You've been probably asked this so. Don't do this shit. Do not preface your email or whatever with an apology for how busy they are. It just takes more time to read through it. So you've probably been asked this question before, but overall, do you think psychologists are better at psychotherapy or psychiatrists? Honestly, probably. Well, so the evidence is that I don't think that either one is better. I think that's actually what the data shows. That the outcomes from social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists are about the same. If you actually look at the training, the psychologists are better trained post-training at therapy than psychiatrists are. The hours of training that psychologists get for therapy is probably greater than the hours of training that psychiatrists get. Psychiatrists get a lot more diverse training, right? So we learn how to treat heart attacks and deal with strokes and deal with physical problems, which psychologists don't get. Psychologists. Wrapping ankles. Wrapping ankles, yeah. Some, you know. But I think the main thing that, if you really look at the data, it suggests that generally speaking, 10 years out, the difference between a social worker, a psychologist, and a psychiatrist is not really that clear. A couple of things to remember is that generally speaking, and I don't know, like I don't mean to be insightful here, but like isn't inciting bad feelings. But I think that generally speaking, it is harder to become a psychiatrist than it is to become a psychologist or a social worker. So it's easiest to become a social worker, harder to become a psychologist, and harder to become a psychiatrist. Some people can make the argument that because it is more difficult, that speaks to some amount of discipline or intellect or some combination of all of the above, that in theory makes psychiatrists more capable. But I will be the first to say that I have worked with very competent psychiatrists, very competent psychologists, and incredibly competent social workers, and I have worked with incompetent social workers, incompetent psychiatrists, and incompetent psychologists. So I think the individual person matters way more than the degree. This is true in life. Do not trust the credentials, trust the person. But also recognize that credentials mean something. Right, very specific thing. Don't use it as a shortcut and then end all be all. So anonymous has donated $100, thanks a lot. Alastair, 4,926.93. Shushupana, 301, thanks a lot. Low DPM, 10,000. My cool man is trolling us with his $361 donation. Here's the rest of my COVID check SpaghettiOs money. Thank you for helping so many people. You're probably helping yourself by not spending all of your COVID money on SpaghettiOs, TBH. Although. Eat some fruit. When I was in high school, SpaghettiOs thinned it out a little bit, a little bit of that Parmesan cheese, a lot of black pepper, a little bit of red pepper. Not too bad. So Angie donates $10 and asks, love everything you're doing here though. Will it be possible for non-US citizens to become in training coaches anytime soon? Absolutely. So like in our, soon, I don't know, but like. Depends on where you are. Every country is a little bit different. And we want to roll it out. Basically we want to roll out internationally as fast as possible. We have to do it kind of step by step. So it's not necessarily we flip the international switch, but we kind of have to flip the switches strategically for the countries that are most business friendly, where we don't have to like set up like a whole new locus of business. It's just. Yeah. So the thing that you guys have to remember about international is like, we have to go to each country that we want to operate in and comply with all of the legal stuff, which involves paying lawyers to figure out what the laws are and then go through the process of complying with all their stuff. Right? So we have to get our own systems to comply. It's yes, we want to expand internationally. That's the mission. And like we've already moved heaven and earth to get people who don't get it to support this, to pay, you know, for coaches that are abroad already to figure this out. And we will continue to, because it's important. And I feel like the rest of the world needs to catch up. So we have an international focus from day one, right? So like we even moved our streaming times to be more EU friendly. Right. And we're doing a Dondor stream instead of a barbecue stream. And so we definitely want to like, we recognize that like mental health is not like an American problem. Lots of jokes can be made there. Lots of digs can be made there, but you know, so we want to do it. It's just like, we're pretty committed to offering a high quality and above board service. So if you're a coach from a foreign country, we want you to be able to like legally get paid and like not get in trouble with your government because we're doing something shady, shady off the side and like sending you money via PayPal. Which honestly, when it was just the two of us. It was fine. It was fine. We did shut like this. You know, we don't want to get like- But now it's your money. You know, I don't want to be like arrested when I fly to a country and I like walk into the airport and there's a warrant because of like tax evasion in your country or some shit. Yeah, we really like to travel. We'd like not to be. Yeah, we haven't traveled in years, but. Yeah. Tocino Sheen, thanks for the $100 donation. Thank you, Dr. K for everything you do. You're most welcome, bro. Thank you for your support. Watermelon donated five bucks. I'm just going to call this out. French date, get your pogs out. Boys PogChamp. I don't even know what that means. French date? Does that shit, does it make any sense? That's me. Okay. So Lord Shuku for a $10 donation, training the coaches, do you have in mind LGBT people as common victims of the status quo and how to make the sessions a safe space like using the proper pronouns and things like that? I know this is going to sound weird, but the answer is yes and no. So my biggest experience with human beings is that what brings us together is way more common than what divides us. So I like working with people. For office? No, no, no. That's like a political thing. But it's not, it's like the incel thing. Why do we keep on having fake incels on the street? No, you're right. It's because they're not, incel is not a real thing. You can call yourself an incel and sure you can identify with that, but at the end of the day, I fundamentally believe that we're all fucking human. And whether you're a man trapped in a woman's body or a woman trapped in a woman's body or a man trapped in a man's body, I'm not saying that your experiences of life aren't different and that you suffer in unique ways based on your gender, based on your ethnicity, based on your minority status, based on your socioeconomic class. I'm not saying that that is not different. But the whole point of our coaching program is for us to treat everyone the same. Yes. Right? And if that involves like, if it involves accommodations for specific people, absolutely. If your experience of life makes it different for you to interact in the world, that's absolutely something that we wanna understand. But here's the crazy thing. I don't think that we standardize that teaching. The way we're training our coaches is to acknowledge that each person that you meet is an individual and not judge them based on their LGBT. Don't judge them based on their religion. Don't judge them based on their ethnicity. Don't judge them based on their country of origin or their capacity to speak English. Treat them like a human being. Meet them as a human being. And don't define them as LGBT to begin with. Right. And so like, in a sense, do we have LGBT specific education? I think like, not really. And maybe that's something that we need to work on. And like, I'm open. If people think that that's a problem, by all means, like, let us know and we'll try to do better. I'm not saying that I'm right. I'm just sharing with you what is my internal compass. Like when an LGBT person comes into my office, I treat them as a human being. And when they say like, if you guys don't know what this is like, so like, I one time had a transgender patient that like blew my mind. I was like, I've been transgender for a while. And I realized like, oh, this is what it means to be transgender. And if you guys wanna understand what it means to be a transgender person, I've got a great exercise for you. So if you're a man, works, I think, better for men, or that's what I can identify or understand better if you guys wanna hear. It's like a really interesting exercise. If you're a man, get some articles of women's clothing and put them on. Like put on high heels, and put on makeup. And if you feel really fucking uncomfortable with no one else in the room, now you know what a transgender person feels like. Because every day when a transgender person wakes up and they put on those clothes, they feel the way that you do in lipstick and high heels. Right? So like, I arrived at that understanding not by treating this person as different, but by genuinely asking this person, what is your experience of the world? And I think whether you've got abusive parents or single parents, or you grew up in this country, or that country, or you're transgender, we have to start by training our coaches with the ethos of try to meet this person where there's at. And don't assume, because I think this is a really big problem, don't assume that just because they're LGBT, you understand them because you went through the LGBT curriculum. Right? Like, a LGBT person is not defined by their LGBT status, or LGBTQ. Like, should you appreciate that? Should you appreciate that this person's experience of life has been traumatic because the society that they live in doesn't allow them to be who they are? Absolutely, you should appreciate that. But I think it's actually a disservice to our coaches and a disservice to our population. If a coach checks a box in their mind in terms of who you are, and then starts applying a protocol of a script about how you treat these people, I think they're actually doing you a disservice. You're a person, and your experiences are unique. And I know this is kind of a mind blowing revelation, but not all LGBTQ people have the same experience of life. Like, wow. That's crazy, man. Treat them as individuals, and that's what we try to do. That assumption is devastating. It really is. And I think there are good reasons for that assumption sometimes. Right? So like, I think that like, anyway, we can get into, like, I don't think that the LGBTQ movement is bad. I see this with like women's stuff too. People are like, oh, you're a woman, blah, blah, blah. Apply for the women's venture capital funds. Do the women in MBA stuff. And I'm like, fuck you and your tiny slice of the pie. I'm part of the whole thing. Don't relegate people to a slice of the pie if they're, like, just, everybody is part of the whole thing. Okay, so Shushupana said donated $1,000. Also been a serial supporter of the stream. Almost there. Tterm, $234.56. Good luck, Moses. Vote yeah. Um. Moses, are you nervous? How are you feeling? So. Am I nervous about tomorrow? The E-date? Is the E-date tomorrow? No. I was like, that's a long time to put together a bio-data. Like, Moses, we have to search the internet farm. We have to figure out our high school GPAs. Yeah. So, Stapka32 with the donation of 200 bits. I'm just starting my search for a mental health professional. Do you have any advice as to how I should start my search? Yeah, so I think the main thing to remember about finding mental health professionals, so you can use, like, websites like Psychology Today or whatever if you're in the US. You can also talk to your, like, your doctor and ask for referrals. So those are two main areas. The one thing I really caution you guys to remember is that mental health professionals are about fit. So if you don't like one, it's not that you don't like therapy. It's just that you don't like that therapist. So try a couple. So Brawl Online, $100. Thanks for the don... Here, this is a donation stream now, Money Laundering Pog. Okay. And, okay, so the last word. I've been practicing third eye meditation for $100 donation. I've been practicing third eye meditation for every day for about three weeks and has done wonders on me. But I was wondering if there were any progressive steps or higher levels to the laser beam. I should do, or if it's always the same thing, love you both. There are absolutely different levels, dude. That's just level one, man. There's like way more levels to third eye, Agna Chakra Sadhana, which means third eye spiritual techniques. Unfortunately, I don't teach those on stream because of safety concerns, because they can be powerful. Why are you typing? This is, it's your... I'm trying to, because they're always like, what are you saying? Agna Chakra Sadhana. Yeah, there are more advanced techniques. So, yeah, so we're gonna have to think a little bit. So like, I think, if we do something, I know you guys don't like the retreat, but like, I wanna teach more advanced meditation, but I don't wanna do that on stream because it really, I've been taught that it can be dangerous. And there's scientific evidence that doing like meditation without being prepared can be like mentally damaging. So, if you've done our stuff fantastic, hopefully you can find a teacher for more advanced practices. And at some point we may start teaching that stuff. Legendary Pancake. I have bad anxiety and my girlfriend has bad depression and relies on me for most of her happiness. I love her a fucking lot. It's been a bit better since we started talking about it, but my anxiety tells me to end the relationship almost every day. What do I do? So I think it's important to remember that like a good relationship is not, doesn't involve just love, right? So a good relationship has to have two human beings who can adequately support each other. And I've been working recently with a patient of mine about someone that they're very much in love with. And like, the takeaway from that patient is that you guys may be right for each other, just not right now. Yes. Right, so like, I think it's hard for you to have a healthy relationship with someone who is reliant on you if you don't have the strength to be their rock. And I don't think you should blame yourself for not having the strength to be their rock because sometimes people need you to be a bigger rock than you can be, or even that can exist, right? Sometimes like if you have codependent relationships, their strength needs to come from them and can't come endlessly from you. That's not actually good for them. So I'd say continue talking and like recognize that like, and relies on me for most of her happiness, that's gotta change because you can't be responsible for most of someone's happiness over the course of an entire relationship, right? She's gotta take individual responsibility and you've gotta take individual responsibility. You can't be the treatment of her depression. You can absolutely be a supportive partner for her treatment of depression, but you can't be the treatment for her depression. And she can't be the treatment for your anxiety. She can support you as a human in terms of your war with anxiety, but ultimately you've gotta fight that war and ultimately she's gotta fight that war. Or she's gotta recruit people who can help her fight that war like mental health professionals. Would this be a good couples counseling candidate? Yes, but I don't even think it's a couples problem. I think it's like an individual problem, right? The whole point is that like the unit here that they need to be working on is not them as a couple, it's them as individuals. I agree, I agree. Like some of the thing that you were talking about earlier with like the line between therapist and friend, right? You can't be everything. And at some point you're doing it to service by being everything. Yep. Right, so be what you can for another person. And just because you love them doesn't mean that you should fill the slots that you can't fill. Like love is not a substitute for like a medical degree so that you can treat depression. Just different things, right? So be a supportive boyfriend if you can or girlfriend if you're a woman. And like that's what you can do. And if you need to lean on, like if they need to lean on you for emotional support, that's absolutely your job. It's not your job to treat their depression. And it's a great point that like, there's a difference between being a friend, being a partner and being a therapist. So get a professional if she's got bad depression. Okay, so Waldemar88, I'm tired of being a programmer. I've not had enough patience thus far to study psychology. How do I figure out what is my dharma to find my direction in life? Here's my monthly food food quote. No. I'm tired and I've not had enough patience thus far to study psychology. How do I figure out what is my dharma? I think figure out, so if you are employed as a programmer somewhere, figure out what extended leave looks like your place of employment. See how, what needs to happen for you to get like two months off without you having to go on maternity leave. I think that could help you a lot to figure out, like I don't know what the point of studying psychology is for this person. I think a little bit of time off would be really good. Yeah, so I would say if you're tired of being a programmer, like explore what is, so this is the problem is people like, they make a diagnosis about themselves without any understanding of like why that diagnosis is true. So I think that like, if I was working with this person, the place that you, there's so much here that you can find answers with. This person is looking for answers. There's so many like, there's so many answers right in this question. I'm tired of being a programmer. First question is why? When did you get that way? What is tired of being a programmer feel like? What about being a programmer is tiring? Exactly. And as you find those answers, then you'll find your compass, right? It's the reason that you don't jive with being a programmer that like tells you where you should go. Everyone's asking, where should I go? But no one's asking to how did I get here? Everyone's like, Dr. K, what should I do? And it's like, stop buddy. Like, let's not even focus on the future for a second. Let's focus on the present and focus on the past. Because that's where you're gonna find your answers. So when did you get tired of becoming a programmer? What got you into programming in the first place? Did you have an ideal that if you were a programmer, you were a particular way? Do you have that same ideal about psychology? Because if that's what's driving you, you're gonna be unhappy as a psychologist anyway. And also why is being a programmer the defining thing that you are? Cool. Okay. Pex and Pierre, thank you for the $500 donation. Max Z for the $20 donation. I've always struggled with finding a job that's right for me or even a field that I would want to work in. It feels like I never had any indicators in which direction to go. Now I'm stuck in a dead end job and still don't know what to do. Any advice? You wanna go? I think you have something to say. Absolutely, man. So this is exactly what I'm saying, right? You guys see it's the same question. I've struggled finding a job that's right for me. So what is wrong about those jobs? That's where you have to start. I have something to say now. So on the Discord, Moses, tell me if I'm wrong, but I put this, I shared it, it's from my business goal and it helps you understand what you want in a job and what will be fulfilling in a career. It's that career kickoff questionnaire, Moses. But if we link that in the Discord, I think that'll help a lot of this. Go ahead. Yeah, so I think like y'all have a problem. You guys are looking for a treatment without a diagnosis. The diagnosis is in Discord. This is the basic issue, right? Like you're like, any advice? Yeah, I'd figure out deeply what the fuck is wrong with what you've done so far. Because I want you all to think about this. You can't know something is wrong without a compass, right? So someone shared something really brilliant in the group that I run. And they were saying that, so one person was making music in the group and they were saying like, yeah, the music isn't good. And I beat myself up because it's not what I sound like. And someone else responded with like, that's really awesome because that means you know what good music sounds like. You have a compass that's telling you what good music sounds like. And what you make isn't aligned with that yet. So just follow that compass because you know what good music is. And as long as you keep chasing that, that is the guiding force that is eventually gonna help you make good music. Brilliant. So if you're in the dead end job, look at what part of your soul is telling you that this is a dead end job and explore that. Because you can figure out like, you know, if I eat a piece of food and it's like this food isn't good, and then I ask you in what way is the food not too good? And then if you dig into that and you're like the food is too salty, okay, now I know what direction to go. The direction that you guys are looking for, I'm gonna hold it for a second, the direction that you guys are looking for is in your very question. So look there. So this is also like a supply demand thing, right? So what do you have to give and what do people want? So I would second things like Upwork or Fiverr or Cadillac depending on kind of where you are in your career, put your skills out there, work on a few projects and figure out where you're most valuable. And that might be where you can charge the highest rates, but it might also be what kinds of jobs you get the best feedback on. And I'll tell you, even if you're just a great writer, people need great writers. It might not be the kind of writing that you want to do, it might not be this lovely prose or poetry or whatever that you want to write, but people need good writers. And if that's what your talent, put that out there. And I think you have to kind of also be open to shaping, like there's no purity in kind of art and creative anymore. So you have to kind of be open to, well, this is what you have, but this is what they want and you have to kind of shape it to that. So as long as you know that that's the professional manifestation of what you're good at, then you can, if you want a pure expression of your art, that's gonna have to be on the side, at least until you get your name and your reputation out. Do you know what OnlyFans is? People are typing OnlyFans. I've heard of it, but it's basically where people would get naked pictures of you, I think. I don't know. We have a strict no nudes policy in the Kenosha household. Okay, hello, Dr. Kane, Mrs. Kay. I suffer from CPTSD, so that's complex PTSD and treatment resistant depression from an abusive childhood. I feel uncomfortable in normal and comfortable in dangerous chaotic situations. Can I still have healthy relationships? Absolutely, you just need to work on that. Like, so I'd say if you actually have a diagnosis of complex PTSD, that's a good thing. But if you're not comfortable with it, if you actually have a diagnosis of complex PTSD, that's something you need to work through with a therapist. And you have to understand why you feel comfortable in chaotic relationships and uncomfortable in normal relationships. So let's just think about this for a second. I feel uncomfortable in normal, I feel uncomfortable in normal relationships and comfortable in dangerous or chaotic relationships. Can I still have healthy relationships? Absolutely, all you have to do is tolerate the discomfort for a time and then the discomfort will go away. So I don't know how else to say this, but like a lot of times we let comfort or discomfort guide our actions, that's a big fucking mistake. Yep. Right, if you can learn to tolerate discomfort, what you're capable of in life is like very different. So you can have a healthy relationship that you're gonna feel uncomfortable in for a time and then hopefully with like a good therapist, they can help you feel comfortable with that relationship. But discomfort doesn't mean that you have to retreat from the relationship. Do you wanna talk about what a good therapist is like? Like what kinds of specific things people can ask to find a good therapist? Honestly, it's tough because like I think it's fit, right? So like here's a good therapist, when you sit down with someone and you feel like you're full of over time understanding who you are, the most important thing is for a therapist to get. The job of a therapist is not to give you advice, we don't give advice. What we help you do is understand yourself. So if you feel like they understand you, then that's the most important thing. And the second thing is like if you have a problem with a therapist, what makes a good therapist is a good client. Like this is, I know it's kind of crazy. This is important. But like somewhere along the way, clients stop taking responsibility for like what happens in therapy. Like I hate to break it to you guys, but I'm only 50% of what's in the room when I sit with a patient. I can be the most brilliant therapist in the world. And if the client doesn't help me, then like I can't fix them, right? So how do you be a good client? So you tell the therapist if something is not working for you. That is the most important thing. After six weeks, you can say, hey, I feel like you understand me, but I don't feel like we're getting anywhere. And I don't feel like this is like, I feel like it's a waste of my time. I love it when clients say that. Because then, just like all these people who are in dead end jobs, I ask the question, why is this dead end therapy? What's wrong with this therapy? Why is this therapy not working for you? And then as we dig into that, it's like, yeah, because like sometimes you just talk too fucking much. And I have something to say, and you get on your rant and you soapbox, and you tell me about what's wrong with them. And then I'm like, thanks for letting me know. And then I shut the fuck up. And then six weeks from then, we're moving forward. But they've gotta tell me, right? You gotta tell your therapist if you feel like things aren't working. And then you guys have to work on it together, and that's a good therapy. You have to think about your time and your money too, right? You don't need to be throwing good time after bad, good money after bad money. So think about, I hate using your language, but like. Join the dark side. No, tell your therapist, I think, this is what I wanna work on. And tell your therapist, that's not gonna work for me, and here's why. I've also had bad fit with therapists because they didn't get me. They didn't get me culturally. And so they didn't understand why living in an extended family and all that stuff was gonna be important to me. And I think anytime you feel a value judgment or something like that, to me that's like strike one, but you have to give the therapist a chance to kinda come out of their own value judgments. They're human. You also have to give them clues. You have to lead them. You really have to lead them to water. So on my end as a patient, that's kinda where I was. I think on his end as a therapist, having that feedback is super important. Don't be that person that walks out of a hair salon with their head shaved off and they ask you, is this what you asked for? And you say, yes. Don't do that. Right, it's a therapist's job to help you, but it's your job to let them know what is working and what isn't working. Yes. They cannot, they only know what they know. Right, so it's your job to tell us stuff and our job to help you figure it out. So quote donated $150. I'm a 28 year old classical musician who just started figuring out his mental, figuring his mental shit out and I'm about to change my profession. Good for you, man. I'm very anxious about my age and frustrated about the fact that some doors, STEM fields are almost closed to me now. Yeah, so like, I don't know what's closed to you at the age of 28. I don't think anything's closed. Like the oldest dude in my medical school class when it was in his mid thirties, I think, or maybe even 40. Like a first year medical student was like 40 years old. STEM fields, like you can be 28. Like I know that doors, so I am very anxious about my age and frustrated about the fact that some doors are almost closed to me. What I deduce from all of those qualifiers is that no door is actually closed. So what are you frustrated about? Because doors aren't actually closed. You're frustrated, your frustration is real, but that shit comes from in here. It doesn't come from the outside. One of the people that I'm most excited about in my business school class, he is a professional drummer. He plays with different orchestras. I'm really excited about his transition into the gaming space. He's gonna basically be running consumer insights and product in gaming spaces because he knows how to read a room. He knows how to react to an audience. He knows how to understand whether or not the performance is clicking with somebody. And I think there are a lot of skills in there in being a musician that are really translatable if you figure out what they are, if you figure out how to talk about them, and if you figure out what exactly you wanna do. Okay, so next, Purple Platypus. Thank you for the $250 donation. Sorry for procrastinating. Keep up the great work. Great stuff. So CPTOBVS, $100. How do I make the decision if I have found the right career job or if I'm just being complacent? I'm an ISFJ male currently in an IT help desk role in a global corporation. I derive quite a bit of joy and satisfaction from being able to provide solutions. So it sounds like you're in the right spot. So here's what I'd say to CPTOBVS. Just don't stop your upward mobility. So if you're in an IT help desk, try to get promoted. Like if you enjoy providing satisfaction, if you get joy and satisfaction out of providing solutions, provide bigger solutions, or at least entertain the idea of providing bigger solutions for bigger clients for more money. I think IT help desk is a great place to start, but don't stop. That's all I'd say to you, man. If you like your job, like that's awesome. Just like, you know, move up the ladder as best as you can. Okay, so we're gonna have to wrap up soon, guys. So I'm gonna focus on the $100 donations. We tried to do some of the lower donations, but I just wanna be mindful of people's effort and sort of the boundaries that we set. So I wanna make sure that if you, if we set a certain parameter, if we made a promise, we wanna keep it. So I'm gonna shift a little bit, okay? Shift a little bit, okay? Okay, so what can I do to improve my dharana and focus on doing things I avoid? I feel worthless and I know why, but haven't been able to reconcile it. Thanks for all you've done and want to do. You're not carrying it alone. Thanks, man, I appreciate it. The long guy's soul is also carrying now at JK, okay. What can I do to improve my dharana and focus on doing things I avoid? I feel worthless and I know why. So let's stop there. So I don't think you feel worth, I don't think you know enough of the why, right? So like, so dig into really why you feel worthless. And the second thing to do, so the second step is to catch the feeling of worthlessness as it alters your behavior. So you can say, okay, I feel worthless because I had an abusive stepdad, fine. Then what happens is when you try to engage a behavior, notice that worthlessness rise up within you and notice that it says, oh no, you don't need to apply for a job, you're never gonna get it. They're never gonna interview you, you piece of shit. And then say like, oh, that worthlessness comes from the voice of my father or my stepfather or whatever. And then catch it in the moment, that's the second step. That requires training. It requires dharana, absolutely. So practice your dharana, like practice meditation. Can you keep your mind one pointed for 20 minutes at a time? Learn theroptica, fixed point gazing or candle gazing. Can you stare at a candle for 20 minutes? You have to learn it properly without blinking. Can your attention be fully focused on a candle flame for 20 minutes with no deviation? If you know why you feel worthless, if you catch the worthlessness and if you practice your dharana, I don't think that you're gonna have a problem. I think you'll be able to do it. Okay, you have to learn medit, you have to learn theroptica properly. Don't just learn it from the internet, like learn from a teacher. Okay. I have a question. Shout out to Healthy Gamer Discord voice chatters for being bros, awesome, and I lied, there is no question. Also, I'm a backend developer if you need any cloud or infrastructure help. Beautiful. Going on the list. See, this is how you do it, guys. You guys were wondering, how do you get your foot in the door? This is how you do it, right? You get noticed, right? So BVector like donated $100, so we read his donation. That's the foot in the door. And he's like, I'm also a backend developer if you need any cloud or infrastructure help, right? Like that's, it's masterfully done. Doesn't waste our time, it's not a life story. I mean, you don't have to donate, but like I think like he got his foot in the door. Like, let's just look at this, I'm assuming you're a dude. Why do you get to assume he's a dude, but I never get to assume people are dudes. I don't know, BVector sounds like a dude. Sort of like Mustafa. Can you get? No, I'm not getting to the fucking door there. I'm gonna get up. Okay. All right. But do you guys see what BVector did, what she did? It's not a she. You guys see how she did that? He's like, if you need a backend developer, not if you need a developer, he or she didn't say, I'm a developer if you need help with programming. They were specific. Yes, and we probably will need that, thank you. Yeah, we actually do need that. Thank you. So, I was planning to buy a whole lot of, so Anonymous donates $100. I was planning to buy a whole lot of Shungite with this money. Anyone knows what Shungite is? Not Suge Knight, he's in jail. I don't know what that means, man. I'll read it out and I'm sure it'll get clipped and taken out of context, but like, so there's your money's worth, hopefully. See, they only know what they know. Okay. So, all right, guys. So like, we're gonna take another break. And what were the three DLCs? Like, I don't, I mean, I feel like it's a letdown to not do any DLCs. So I'm gonna do my healthcare DLC, but we'll do the other DLCs next week. Cause I can't, I can't- Cause I got him drunk. Study DLC, healthcare DLC and dream job. Okay, great. So we'll do, we'll do how to study on Monday and we'll do, try to do, yeah, we'll do those. We'll do all three of them, I promise you guys. But let's, you guys, why don't we do a quick poll and y'all tell me which DLC y'all want me to do and then we'll do it. Okay, I need to go pee though, urinate. So we'll be right back. Thank you guys very much for the, you know, 102 thousand dollars. Jesus. I will play it to a chat. Stronger bros. Honestly, this is- And everything in between. Moses, can you put together the number of how many total people this is that have donated? Okay, we'll see. I'm not sure on the total, but you want the numbers also for, like donos under a hundred, right? A hundred. Yep. I think that was like, last time I checked it was like 16,000. That's- 16,000 people. That's amazing, dude. Thank you guys very much. Okay, I gotta go pee. So honestly, we're doing this- Click this button when you're- For the 16,000 people, with the generosity of like the five people that have donated a thousand or more. I think it's more than five, but you know what I'm saying. Okay, what did he get me? What's in the box? I feel like these are like dumb questions again. What's in the box? What's at the top? Google it. Shungite. Just get stitches. Oh my God. It is so clear where your loyalties lie. Feel like a divorce- Me? I get to keep you. I have a question. Would we, for the scholarship fund, what do you feel are appropriate criteria for people to qualify for the scholarships? And what do you feel are appropriate amounts to give out? Like should we fully fund fewer people or should we give out like a thousand dollars to a lot of people? Wait, is this like a question for me or for- Everyone. Because we're doing the scholarship fund now, so we gotta put together like, you know, people to process the applications, a way to award it out, the whole thing. I think we should find like one person and just be like, you know? So you, but that's just inviting like the most tragic story, right? There's no way to fact check like any of this. We need a- What are we all talking about? The scholarship. A trauma resume. Okay, we can sort it out later. Like I don't, let's just, let's move on because we really have to go. So I want to do the DLC. Okay? Okay. Okay. This chair is so much better than that other chair. Ikea Pog. You don't have to stick around for the DLC if you don't want to. If it's the healthcare one, I'm sticking around. It's not healthcare. It looks like it's how to find your dream job is what 45% of people want. Okay. I'll give you five minutes. And if I feel like you're not doing a good job, I'll interject. It's gonna be a good job. Can we swap though? Because I need to use the computer. I know, because you want the good chair. All right. You can have the good chair. No. You just sit over. Oh, wait. Always strings attached. Always strings attached to your station. You can have the good chair. You can have like the $50 Ikea chair. I don't take the $200 Ikea chair. That is actually worse than the $50 Ikea chair. Sponsorship opportunity Pog. No, do not invite gaming chair sponsorships. Oh my God. Trying to get sponsored by Ikea. We need a Herman Miller sponsorship. That's what we need. Dude, are Herman Miller's in Boston? Our Herman Miller. We treat it like a child. Okay. So let's do, how do you find the job of your dreams? Okay. So the first thing we need to do to a chat is you guys need to tell me what, let's pick a job. Let's actually do this. Okay. So like you guys just toss out a job. Let's start. Web developer. I'm seeing accountant a lot. Aren't you? Mathematician, psychologist. Game Dev. Okay. Analyst analyzing the web. Okay. Let's see. I'm seeing this. I'm seeing this. I'm seeing this. Okay. Let's see. I'm seeing this. I'm seeing this. I'm seeing this. Analyzing the web. US president, lawyers. Translator, dealer, hacker. This is like some really cool character creation shit we have going on. Seriously. Okay. Someone said data scientist. That's good. Hey, Moses. Just by the way, if anybody wants to run like a pitch deck or startup advice, I can do that. Never, we're however you need. Okay. So let's do game designer. Okay. So this is what we're gonna do. Okay. Okay. So we're gonna do this. So this is what we're gonna do. Okay. You guys see this? So let's do game designer. So give me a company to a chat. Give me a company. Okay. I'm seeing a lot of votes for Riot. I think we did this with Riot. Okay. So let's do Riot. Okay. Okay. Open positions. So let's pick one. League of Legends modes. Okay. Okay. So this is how you start. You see this? Coffee pasta. So someone's saying, I live at home. I don't know where to start. I wanna be a game designer. Okay. So let's look at the response. Let's look at what they want. Okay. So work with a diverse team of developers to build new content. So we're gonna do this. Okay. Guys, can you all see this? Okay. Okay. Represent player experience and needs in discussion. Openly share work and critiques and seek feedback from other designers. Use existing design principles to help deliver high quality work. Help identify new principles and frameworks to aid future design. Deconstruct complex problems into manageable size chunks. Help draft messages to players sharing context on design plans and rationale. Okay. Required qualifications. Two years of experience in game design. So we're gonna do this actually. Okay. Okay. You can apply and execute an analytical approach to design. You identify what creates interesting gameplay, what's appealing to players and why things work. You're able to translate lessons from one genre into another. Okay. You're capable of identifying a problem generating a range of solutions to it and identifying the most appropriate one. This is the fifth thing that I was talking about. Don't get pissed. Figure out the solution. You work well with others who are exemplary at sharing and seeking feedback. Again. Okay. You... Drunk typing for the win. You deeply understand and communicate player needs, especially when on deep, meaningful player connections with special game modes that keep league fresh. Okay. You have a strong understanding of current gaming tastes and trends in the global market. Okay. You can clearly articulate the goals of your project to both designers and non-designers along with the rationale behind how you execute those goals. Your work is internally coherent thematic where appropriating trades of different values against each other is needed to accomplish team goals. Okay. So we're gonna unpack this. So the first thing is, I don't know if you guys get this, but this is a to-do list. I want you guys to think about a job qualification as a to-do list. So when you're saying, I don't know where to start, each of these things is something that you can work on. Work with a diverse responsibility to build new content and features for League of Legends. Okay. So... Represent player experience and needs in discussion. Okay. Openly share work and critiques. Okay. Deconstruct complex problems. Draft messages to players sharing content on designs and personnel. Okay. So let's think about like, which of these can we do? Okay. So I'll tell you guys, I've worked with about a dozen people literally doing this, sitting down with them and six or seven of them have salaries where they earn after two years or earning a hundred to $300,000. Six of them are earning a hundred K and two of them are earning literally over $200,000. And we started with this. So the first thing that I want you guys to notice, do they require a degree? No. Nowhere in here is a degree. You guys get that? Like I wanna just check in with Twitch chat for a second. Okay. Right? So like, and then let's just think through this because I don't think you guys realize how good y'all actually are. Okay. So work with a diverse team of developers to build new content and features in League of Legends to deliver on Riot's strategic goals. Okay. So what we're gonna take away is work with a diverse team. Okay. Represent player experience and needs in discussion. Awesome. So like, what this means is like, we want to be able to demonstrate speaking for players. Okay. So like creating a community guide, active on subreddit for discussion forums, okay. Cause we wanna represent players experience and needs in discussion. So you can literally start posting on subreddits or discussion forums on League of Legends and check this box. You have to do a good job and it's gonna take time, but do you guys get that? Like I'm gonna check in to a chat. Do y'all understand that? Like that's actually one of the, just let's think about this, okay. The responsibilities one, two, three, four, five, six. Out of the six responsibilities for your dream job, you can start one today by representing player experience and needs in a formalized discussion. Y'all can do that shit today. 15% of the job description, you can start today. Right? Like you can start being active on the discussion forums. And by the way, if you're really good at any one of these things, you can be a little less good on some of the other stuff. Openly share work and critiques and seek feedback from other designers, okay. Get good at feedback. Use existing design principles to help deliver high quality work. Help identify new principles and frameworks to aid future design. This one is learn MBA speak. Do you guys get that? Y'all with me? Actually, I should do this. Then I can see you. I can help you with that. Like this is MBA speak, right? So this is gonna be like read business journals, read programming or watch. Can I tell you what this really means? Go ahead. This really means tell our designers what to do in a way that they understand. Okay, read or watch gaming conference. Tell designers what to do. It just means understand design principles. Okay, fine. So here's what we're gonna do. Gaming conference. Search up gaming design principles. Gaming design principles. Look at this. You guys see the auto complete? Y'all see this shit? That's what I'm saying. Just fucking Google things. Okay, beautiful. Okay. Look at this. This is what we're gonna do. I'm gonna give you guys an example. Four keys to fun. Okay, are you all ready? You guys ready? Okay. At some point, you guys know that you have to write a cover letter, a resume, right? This is what we're gonna say on our resume. And we'll get to this. So you're gonna say internship because that's where you have to start at New Game Company. And then what you're gonna say is. So you're gonna go to the company. You're gonna intern there for a while. You're gonna read this document. And anything in this document that applies to your job, you're gonna pick out. And then you're gonna be specific with it. So used. So when you're describing your job at the company, you're gonna say, use the Buster Principle to. To. Zoom in, baby. To. Use the Buster Principle to. Let me think about how to phrase this. I'm searching for information to process. Use the Buster Principle to better understand. Or so, hold on. To improve cosmetic monetization using the availability. Availability heuristic. Specifically targeting negativity bias. This is gonna be on your resume. And then you're gonna say, see appendix A. And then you're gonna add an attachment. When you apply for your job, they're gonna ask you for a CV. And then you're gonna ask them, do you guys mind if I submit an appendix? And they're gonna be like, sure. Or they may be like, we're not sure. People don't usually do that. And absolutely. So what appendix A is gonna be, you're gonna read this document. And then you're gonna summarize the Buster Principle. So game designers, inadvertently, make the game too hard. And good game design inherently captures Lazarus Four Keys to Fun. And you're gonna write about it. You're just gonna read this document. And this is the cool thing, okay? I'm gonna move back to Twitch chat. But make it specific. Yeah, so this is the cool thing. So I don't want you guys to just BS. So you're gonna read that document and you're gonna actually, because you're a fucking gamer, you're gonna take the things in the document that you think are interesting and that you understand, and you're actually gonna write about it. And then, so you guys get that? It's not just making shit up. You can't just make shit up. I'm doing that now, but hopefully that's, am I losing y'all or y'all good here? Is my mic blowing out? Okay. Good, okay. So the thing is that when you guys do this, okay? You can read that document and then you can start doing this and you can start putting together your cover letter. And then what happens is when you guys put together your cover letter, you can check this off. Once you write that appendix, and then we're gonna talk about getting an internship. And then what you're gonna do is you're gonna ask your intern bosses, like their bosses at your internship. You're gonna say, hey, I'd like to, this is what you do. You go to your bosses at your internship after a month and you say, I'd like to use design principles to help deliver high quality work. I'd like to try to figure out how to use frameworks of design principles to actually implement like a design change. Or can you guys help me understand how to use designing principles? Like how design principles actually go and create the game that y'all are working on. Does that make sense? Hopefully it makes sense. So you're gonna go to your internship and you're gonna use these words and you're gonna say, I wanna learn this thing. And then you're gonna observe that thing. You're gonna take some notes and then based on the notes that you take and based on the PDF that you write and the appendix that you write up, like whatever you think is interesting, you're gonna combine that in some way to make this statement specific to your internship. Okay? So let's keep going. Okay, so once again, like internship. Ask for a complex problem that they need to chunk up. Right? Or just pay attention to what you're doing at your internship. You're gonna see a complex problem and pay attention to when people like chunk things up and how they tackle a complex problem. When you see this happening, cause it's gonna happen in any workspace, ask, hey, this is really cool how you guys are dividing this complicated task of fundraising for mental health and dividing it into multiple stream days with new content. Can I get involved? That's what you say. Do you guys see that? Cause here's the thing, specific questions get good answers. This signals that you understand what's going on. You're not just walking in and you're saying, hey, can you guys teach me how to do this? You're expressing appreciation. You're expressing understanding. What this tells you, what this tells your boss is that I don't have to teach this kid from day one. He understands what's going on and maybe he can help. And then you're gonna write a community guide and try to get it uploaded. And that too is like, maybe this is 50 to a hundred hours. You're gonna make a bunch of community guides. So this, we're gonna gloss over for a second. So what we're gonna do is start with an internship. So let's start with a bunch of people. So let's start with a bunch of people. So let's start with a bunch of people. Shift. Game design at small or medium company. Well, also what is similar experience? Or similar experience, beautiful, good cat, right? So you may be able to get this after the internship. So what you're gonna do is you're gonna find a small company. So what we're gonna do is like go to steam green light. Okay. How does this? We're gonna go to steam early access. You guys with me chat? Okay. So what you're gonna do is look at all of the early access games, publisher, dragons. Okay. Then, okay, it looks like this didn't work. So you're gonna look at the early access games. We're gonna go through, okay. And you find which early access games are you interested in? Oh, let's do iDracula Genesis. That looks pretty cool. Okay, publisher, more games. Here's a test donation for $88. Okay. So then what we do is we say, okay, look, look, there's a link. Cool, team. Okay, fantastic. So then what we're gonna do is we're gonna go through all of these games. Oh, cool, there's another PowerPoint. So read that shit. So we're gonna go through all of the steam curator games. We're gonna find their developers because these are small potatoes and you're gonna email them, right? Press kit, subscribe, find some way to contact them, DM them on Twitter. Take 50 indie game companies and message them. And basically what you wanna say in your cover letter, you're gonna take this job description and you're gonna say, this is what I'm interested in. So this is what you're gonna say, okay? We'll do it this way. Do you wanna post this on the support later? Hello, game company. My name is XYZ and I'm passionate about video games and very interested in interning with you. Because I like specific detail of your game, John. I have a background in using design principles to deliver high quality content. High quality work, C appendix A. I also have experience in, oh shit. Representing player experience and needs and discussion. C community guides A through B. I also have been studying current gaming trends and tastes in the global market. And here we go again. Am I losing y'all Twitch chat? Is this boring for y'all? I can't tell. So I gotta see this real quick. Okay, so current gaming trends in global markets. Okay, and now you guys ready for the next thing? You guys ready for it? There we go. Here we go, look at this. Look at this shit. Look at this. Look at this shit. Look at this. Okay. So you read this and then you find what is interesting about it. Please. So now you've got an interesting choice. You can reach out to whoever wrote this. Industry trends and ask them for an internship. Or you can write your thoughts into appendix B. And then you say, and then you find the thing, you find the thing on this list that you're the weakest in. Right, so what's the thing here that you're weakest in? Okay, so game design role. I'd like to intern with you and apply my novice, because you don't wanna oversell yourself, background in design principles and global gaming trends into actual game design. You don't wanna oversell yourself. You don't wanna say you're the best person for the job. You don't wanna say you're super experienced. I was hoping you had an internship opportunity that would give me a chance to learn actual game design. And then what you do is you can say, even though I have limited experience in actual game design, I hope the above appendices indicate that I, there, and then you clean it up. Right, so I hope that indicate that I have, am capable of producing, so let's rephrase this, okay? So here's our version. I am capable of producing work that is thematically appropriate and internally coherent. I can take information from marketing sources and use them to enhance, and use them, or no, and integrate them with design principles. Or, not I can take, I am interested in. I disagree with this. What? Your work is internally coherent, thematic, or appropriate, and trades off different values against each other as needed. So this is asking you to just have a strong point of view that is supported by something. This is mostly about you saying, like, I evaluated this, I evaluated this, see the pros, see the cons, pros, the cons. I think this is what we should do. This is what's the risk. Here is what we have to gain, the end. So I think that's down here, right? Did we miss something? Well, I think what that should demonstrate is a situation where you kind of had to make a hard decision, and why that decision was the right one. The key thing is, trades off different values, right? So this is business speak for had to make a hard decision. So guys, my point is that you can start, so I'm gonna switch this for a second, okay? So this, so, how can I say this? Okay, so the first thing is that you guys can start with this, right? And literally what I've done is I've sat down with this, and I don't make it up over this course of 15 minutes. You actually have to stop and look at each of those things and understand what they actually mean, just like Ruthie is saying. Oftentimes these people have actually had to learn programming. So many game designers, so we can go back to Lal's page, okay? So let's do this. So I don't see this here, but oftentimes they'll have, like jobs will have proficiency in a particular programming language, right? So they'll say like proficient with Excel, I mean, that's not a programming language, but like proficient in C sharp or Java or whatever people use now. And then what happens is like you have to have proficiency in programming language. So you have to have proficiency in programming language. So you have to have proficiency in programming language. And then what happens is like, you have to start like enrolling in those classes. So while you're doing this business speak, like whatever crap, you're reading stuff about PDFs, you're learning about the industry, like you just actually have to sit down and read the entire PDF and then read another one and then read another one. And the cool thing about this is that the problem that you guys have when it comes to getting out of your rut is this, is at the end of the day, when you look at this, you never get to check anything off, right? You can't find the job of your dreams because you never get to take a step forward. You can't take a demonstrable step forward. But at the end of the day, when you apply for an internship, you can check that, I mean, get an internship, which right? So here's apply for internship. And then like, let's say like required qualifications, okay. And let's add like coding in language, ABC. So then like you start, you join the healthy gamer coding workshop. You get certifications, right? So there are like, you know, like, let's say you're doing something marketing. So there's a Google analytics, analytics certifications. So you get like these independent certifications, which they'll say on the job description. They'll say it over here, like requires like Google analytics certification, this kind of thing, or like proficiency with ABC. And then like, you literally Google that stuff. You sign up for it. And then because you guys can do anything for one month, you cram because y'all are good at cramming. And then you like learn Google analytics certification. And then three months from now, you guys have checked off like 20% of what this has, right? And hopefully starting in the fall, you'll have an internship. And while you're at the internship, then you're going to talk to them about this stuff, share your appendices, you know, actually learn things. And then like a year from now, you'll have completed the internship. What happens for a lot of these guys is they actually do such a good job. Like I think two or three people did such a good job at the internship that they offered them a job. They're like, hey man, you're doing really awesome. Like it sounds like you really are learning a lot of different stuff and you know, really motivated. They'll offer them a job. So you work for that job for a year. And then when you apply to Riot Games, like after you work for them for a year, and then you can say, yeah, I did an internship with this company. They actually offered me a job right at the end of my internship, humble brag, right? But it's a statement of fact. I worked with them for a year, but I found that... The reason that I'm not happy with my job is because I identified problems and offered, I wanted to explore a range of solutions with my bosses, but my bosses like really wanted to do things their way. And I'm looking for a company where I can communicate like possible solutions and get good feedback. So I'm looking for a company where I can communicate and get good feedback. What? Don't ever diss your last boss. Okay. Or your last management team. Yeah, yeah. It shows, I don't know. It's just... I don't, I mean, so all this stuff has to be like worked on a little bit, okay? But like my point is you can say like, hey, I'm really interested in, you don't have to diss your last boss. That's a good point. You can say, I'm really interested in working for a company. You know, they had one product. And so they had pretty like narrow solutions and like next things because it's a startup. And I'd really love to be at a company that, you know, is dealing with complex problems where I can like think about solutions and then discuss them with a team. Right? Does this, does that make sense to you guys? Like that's how you do it. That's like literally how you do it. And then you chip away at each of those things and then you look at each thing and then you kind of figure out, okay, what's the first step to doing this thing? I don't know. I don't know if that was too much or if you guys like weren't able to follow me. Like I'm, cause I wasn't reading Twitch chat. I also think that like when you do apply for that internship and they ask you that, where do you want to be in a few years? You'll have a really good answer. So, so I think here, here's the main thing. Like here's the key thing to take away. The job of your dreams, the job description for the job of your dreams, for the job of your dreams, most people see as an obstacle. It's not an obstacle. It's a roadmap. It's a roadmap. And so you look at it and you start Googling stuff. And I'm telling you, if there's something you don't understand, Google that exact phrase and then add the letters PDF to the end. I'm serious. And that is how you will, like, like you guys want to play, you guys want, you want to test me? You think? Yeah. Dharma is technology. Like what on earth? Okay. So let's find, let's, let's just pick something random. So Ayurvedic, Doshas or professional it's like, like it doesn't even have to be mental health because Ayurveda is just a medicine. Right? Practical Ayurveda, self-development index on 226 pages, 226 pages. Holy hell. This looks good. Right? Like, like seriously, just start. That's how you guys start. Okay. And so the, the, the job requirements for the job of your dream is not an obstacle. It's a roadmap. And then you start with it. You learn things along the way. You take notes. You synthesize them into clear like statements. And then like along the way, you may find that actually you're very interested in gaming trends and marketing, and you're not actually interested in Riot Games. And as you reach out to the people who publish that report, you can say, Hey, I'm a 24 year old living in the U S with a degree in XYZ in computer science. Don't say that you haven't been, you don't have a job. Right? So you can say, I have a degree in computer science. I find myself more interested in like, how can I say this? I find myself more interested in global marketing trends for computer games as opposed to actual programming, which is what I wanted to do. Do you guys have any internship opportunities available? And like, you just shoot things out again and again and again and again. And now we get back to this question of, what do you do after a hundred rejections? Do you guys see how like, I'm expecting to get rejected from that. Who the fuck in some, did you guys even see that the email address is here for that PDF, Fairfield International? Like, look at this. Like astragon.de, these guys aren't going to get back to me. Chimera entertainment.de, they're not going to get back to me. Wuga, I don't know. You're just going to email them all and you're going to copy and paste this email. Copy pasta, baby. And say, I'm interested in like any kind of internship opportunities that you may have. And then you kind of acknowledge, like you can even use phrasing like, look, like you can say that I'm interested in an internship because I recognize that my background in actual programming isn't a perfect fit. So I'm not asking for a job. Do you guys have an internship? No, I wouldn't say that. Okay. I would say I'm a programmer transitioning into consumer insights. I'd love to help you guys figure out your player strategy for the next year. How can I help you? So somewhere along the way, this is also an important step in the process. Try to find someone who can actually help you iron these things out. Yeah. Right? Like try to find a mentor. Maybe you guys can find that on our discord or maybe something for us to think about. But like the whole point that what holds you guys back is that when you think about working at Riot Games, that feels far away. And the thing that I wanna tell you guys over and over again is like, it's not far away. And if you can check something off, if you can move 2% at the end of a month towards a job at Riot Games, like that's awesome. All it's gonna take is 50 months, right? That's four years. Like sure, that sounds like a long time, but like where were you four years ago and where are you now? Like four years from now, like what are you gonna be doing? Like at least move forward in some way. We're gonna do more discord office hours or I will, and I can help you guys look at your resume specifically or job application specifically. Moses and I are gonna figure out the right time and place and format to do that. But I wanna get you guys good jobs. We all are smart, capable people, but don't let us down. Be reliable, do what you say you're gonna do. Come through, be proactive, put that brain power in the right place. I understand that it's about passion and that you have to be motivated and passionate and feel purposeful in what you're doing, but do that first. Only apply to stuff where you feel like that's gonna be true for you and then pull through. I want people saying that people from the Healthy Gamer community are legit. I want people saying that people from the Healthy Gamer community do what they say that they're going to do. There was an emote thing, but it didn't let me share anything, it's weird. Okay, guys. So listen, overall, thank you guys so much. It looks like we've raised $3,000 over the course of the last couple of hours, even after we hit our 100K goal, which first of all, is amazing that we hit that. I really had no idea we were gonna do this. And thank you guys for continually donating. Yeah, I mean, I don't know how else to say this, but thank you guys, because we're here for you. I don't know how to say this, but it feels awesome to know that y'all are there for us. Because you tell us what y'all need and we're gonna work on it. If it's healthcare stream DLC, that's fine. If it's like literally how to sit down and start the process of finding a job, that is what we will do. Yes. I'm telling you guys, like this methodology, like this shit over here, like not an exaggeration. Someone that I did this with and who did this crap for like two years is now making $300,000. And like, it's not all fluff and mirrors, okay? Like they actually went through and read the 100 page PDF over the course of two days and took notes on it. And then they looked at each of those Lazaros four things of success and they PDF to that shit and they PDF to that shit. And this is the other big thing about college. You don't need college to learn something. You can just PDF that shit until you're blue in the face and then you learn it and then you're like, don't make the mistake of going and posting on Reddit when saying I'm very smart and tell like, oh, like you posted this on the League of Legends subreddit. Did I let you know that this sounds like Lazaros four things, four keys of happiness? Let me tell everyone on Reddit how brilliant I am. Don't fucking post on Reddit to show people how smart you are. That's not why you're reading this crap. It's a waste of your brain space. Post on Reddit because you wanna demonstrate to people that you're able to communicate with the community. End game. Don't let your ego get a hand of this. The reason you're learning all this crap is not to show off to your friends on Discord. It's so that you can actually find a fucking job. And if you let your ego get in the way, it's a waste of your time and you're not actually gonna learn. Yeah. Right, don't show off. Okay, so thank you guys very much. We've raised $100,000. Our coaching program is gonna go live This week. Next week. We're gonna find the bugs this weekend. And yeah, and thank you guys very much for doing a lot for us. We wanna do more for y'all and thank you guys for supporting us.
