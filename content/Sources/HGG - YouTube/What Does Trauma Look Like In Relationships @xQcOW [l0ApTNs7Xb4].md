 And then they get even more confused because they don't even know what love feels like. They don't know what unconditional acceptance feels like. So then they start being like, what are you doing? Where's the other shoe? Like, what are you not telling me? You're going to leave me, right? You went out with your friends for a week. Did you cheat on me? I'm sure you cheated on me. Of course you cheated on me. And then the person's like, no, I'm not going to leave you. And the other person's like, you're going to leave me. You're going to leave me. What do they end up doing? They drive them away. Like, I can't deal with this. I'm gone. See, I knew it. I was right all along. You were bullsh** me and you were really good at it. I drive them away for a while and then I decide, you know what? It hurts too much to be loved by someone and have that person abandon me. So now what I'm going to do is anytime there's an instance of genuine love or affection, I know where this ends. I don't want to put myself through it because having someone treat you like s**t and then abandon you, I can manage that. Someone loving you and abandoning you hurts way more. Yeah, okay, true. So Felix, it's the good stuff that hurts in life. Yeah.
