 When someone comes in with this like low grade depression like they're not suicidal or anything but they just like don't feel like doing anything all day and are kind of bummed out and like aren't really happy and like not really motivated and they're just kind of like meh. Like a large percentage of those people I'd say in my practice like 10 percent of those people are like hypothyroid. Okay so here's what we're gonna do I'm gonna give you guys a list a constellation of symptoms and then you guys let me know like whether this applies to you okay. Problems with motivation, problems with memory, problems with executive function. So this is the ability to plan and implement long-term tasks as well as delay gratification, problems with attention, problems with verbal fluency, difficulty learning, problems with psychomotor efficiency. So this kind of means like you could say feeling sluggish okay so this is part of what we're gonna do so next up we have fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, and depression. So we have fatigue, weight gain, constipation, dry skin, muscle aches, and menstrual irregularities. Okay and then over here we've also got anxiety, diarrhea, weak muscles, over here we have fatigue, and then over here we have low energy, insomnia, low mood, low motivation, low enjoyment, and then lastly we've got let's say fatigue, quick to anger, feeling sleepy during the day, um feeling sleepy during the day, poor quality sleep, as well as problems with motivation, executive function, things like that. Okay so first question chat is do these things apply to y'all? Okay so like these this is a collection of different medical conditions and what we're gonna do is some statistical so the first thing is like when I said I wasn't gonna hold back this is me not holding back so if you guys are like hey this is a really long list of like lots of complicated things welcome to medical school chat this is how you become a doctor you memorize lists and lists and lists of clinical presentations and then there's also like lab testing and figuring out what treatments are and stuff like that but these are the things that these are the constellations of symptoms okay so the first thing is like who wants to guess like what is category one? Anyone know? What's your guess for category one? Okay good so someone's guessing ADHD, depression, what else we got? Lack of sleep, insomnia, anorexia, what a vitamin deficiency which vitamin chat we're in med school now this is twitch school of medicine welcome everyone dyslexia lupus vitamin d deficiency vitamin b12 deficiency vitamin b12 deficiency vitamin b12 deficiency vitamin b12 deficiency vitamin b12 deficiency vitamin b12 deficiency right okay so cool cool chat these are this is so good like look at all of these things that could be here thiamine deficiency good someone's oh someone's like actually in medical school vitamin c deficiency autism okay guess what chat all of these are wrong this is type two diabetes so what percentage of y'all are overweight this is the consequence of insulin resistance and high blood sugar this is exact so this is exactly what i'm saying so all gamers should get their blood sugar checked okay so next question chat what percentage of people have type two diabetes do you guys know ah see now now answers are all over the place so this is 10 percent which means that nine out of ten people are going to be healthy and this is going to be important this is going to come up next okay so just because you're overweight you may have some degree of of insulin resistance you may have some degree of like high blood sugar you may have some of these symptoms but what we're really talking about is 10 percent of people have type two diabetes okay next up let's try again so fatigue weight gain cold intolerance constipation dry skin muscle aches and menstrual irregularities what do y'all think this is i think it's globally okay someone's talking about anemia hypothyroidism pots oh my god anxiety chat depression ibs crones okay so what percentage of people have type two diabetes okay so like look chat listen to me listen to me so a lot of these are really good answers pregnant it's good so you know that's good i'm glad someone mentioned pregnancy so pregnancy so one of the key things i learned in medical school is pregnancy is the one diagnosis you should you can never afford to forget about it's something that you always have to i'm assuming you've got a female patient right but like it's the one thing you all like you can never forget about pregnancy you always have to think to yourself is this person pregnant because it changes everything it changes like you know because like medicines can be teratogenic it can be weird berylliosis no it's not berylliosis but i like it food intolerance no so the other thing chat is like do you guys get that these are these are all like good things that you should maybe get evaluated for right puberty no this is another good one oh my god these are great this is so much better gout no so it's right so you guys figured this one out this is hypothyroidism okay so now this is pretty interesting so what do you all think the right answer is hypothyroid so now the question is what uh what it was like the second answer to um what what percentage of the population do you think is hypothyroid what do you all think okay so good i think you guys are like doing better about this so there's conflicting data so this is where this is an important point that i have to share so in my experience there's like true hypothyroidism and then there's subclinical hypothyroidism so the statistics around true hypothyroidism some of them are like one out of 300 right so really small but others other studies will suggest that hypothyroidism is closer to 3.7 percent and this could be kind of in the subclinical range so the reason that i test tsh for all of my patients who have like fatigue and like basically depressive symptoms and like things like weight gain and menstrual irregularities is they may not have full-blown hypothyroidism but around let's say four percent so let's say 96 out of 100 people are going to be totally fine and 3.7 percent or four percent of people will have may benefit some clinically from some kind of thyroid supplementation okay so uh can i explain what the thyroid is yeah so the thyroid gland is like situated here in your neck and releases something called thyroid hormone and thyroid hormone does all kinds of things in your body so the thing to remember about hormones is a hormone is a chemical signal that travels everywhere through your body so the key thing about hormones is that they affect all of your organ systems because they go everywhere and they try to they try to help your body work in concert so another good example is adrenaline adrenaline is a hormone so what is adrenaline on the effect what effect does adrenaline have on the gi system and so this is where i'd ask you what does the body want to do what does the gi system want to do when you're in a situation where adrenaline is released the answer is that your body your your gi system wants to absolutely shut off which is exactly what adrenaline does because if you like you don't want to be digesting food if you're like fighting against the line right like you don't want to worry about like forming stool and digesting things you want to worry about survival so if we look at adrenaline it does things like increase your heart rate it does things like increase your blood pressure it does things like makes your brain think in black and white and makes it think faster and more catastrophically it also does things like shut off your gi system essentially you know like all of like the slow stuff like the rest and digest functions of your brain like it doesn't want to mess with any of that stuff it does things like vaso vasodilate you know the the blood vessels that go to your lungs increases your respiratory rate so hormones are chemical compounds that travel throughout your body and essentially they coordinate all of the body's response they coordinate all of the different organ systems to sort of succeed at doing one thing so thyroid hormone is kind of tricky because it does like a lot of different stuff but essentially like i kind of think about the balance of thyroid hormone is like internally like your yin and your yang so for example people in northern climates will have higher levels of thyroid hormone because thyroid hormone is one of the things that increases brown fat production brown fat is the is how you generate heat within your body so if you look at people who are like you know in northern climates they tend to have slightly higher levels of thyroid hormone they tend to have more brown fat they tend to burn more fat to maintain body temperature which is also why it's kind of super interesting because if you look at obesity as it relates to different climates the more equatorial climates are more prone to obesity and weight gain and as you move north into colder climates you tend to have people who overall tend to be a little bit thinner and so if you look at hypothyroidism it causes weight gain causes cold intolerance whereas if you look at this one is hyperthyroidism but this is considerably rare and so you know hypothyroidism causes constipation hyperthyroidism causes diarrhea hyperthyroidism causes anxiety and then like you know hypothyroidism basically causes like depression symptoms of depression and if you think about depression and anxiety one is like a slow mind one is an overactive mind so thyroid hormone is really interesting because it affects all the different like organs and like really different ways yeah so we'll get to the actual blood tests in a second okay so next up i know it's kind of weird but we've just got fatigue what do you all think this is are there medications for these yes we're going to get let's finish let's finish diagnosing all these then we'll go on we'll talk about tired ibs yes yeah so you so chronic fatigue syndrome that's a new one so we talked about b12 anemia okay vitamin d sure hiv sure that's on there it's actually a good guess yes insomnia myocarditis yes it can absolutely present as fatigue burnout sure there's a lot of stuff so this this one too so this is b12 deficiency so i like this is the other thing about medicine so this is it isn't like i mean i'm sort of trying to simplify things but also give you guys some stuff a little bit complicated so the key thing about b12 deficiency is that it tends to not present as like a bunch of different random stuff like you're not going to see weight gain with b12 deficiency you're not going to see like you know dry skin or muscle atrophy or things like that you may not see quite as much you know like like the specificity of these deficits probably have to do with the high level of sugar and your like your vascular system and things like that so you get like brain wide effects in type 2 diabetes which you may get fatigue and b12 deficiency but you're not going to get quite like you're not going to get like a verbal learning like negative impact and b12 deficiency so b12 deficiency let me just see what how common it is did i forget to look that oh yeah i didn't even look this up so i don't even know it's rare though so the the thing is the b12 deficiency can sometimes happen in people who are like vegans but generally speaking b12 deficiency is quite rare i don't remember the exact statistics but it's something else to consider super easy lab test okay next up we have low energy insomnia low mood low motivation it's one out of 10 000 that makes sense because a lot of b12 comes from animal products yeah so let's say well let's just say one out of 100 so 99 out of 100 people will be correct will be fine okay so low energy insomnia low mood low motivation low enjoyment what do y'all think depression okay insomnia okay parkinson's sometimes actually it's not alzheimer's sure so dementia low iron anemia genetic disorders nice chat dude some real pog poggers out there trauma fibromyalgia yeah so this is the cool thing chat no no this is vitamin d deficiency now vitamin d deficiency numbers are really interesting okay because five percent of the population is vitamin d deficient but 18 percent of the population has subclinical or less than normal so there's like with vitamin d deficiency there's like ranges right so it's kind of like a bell curve and so like you know this is actually like 18 percent of the population and this is like five percent of the population and so there's kind of like a subclinical level and then there's like a clinically deficient level and so the people who are like super clinically deficient which is still five percent of the population will have severe amounts of this and about 20 percent of the population by the way i think maybe that the 18 percent number has something to do with using the internets and playing video games and not going outside and not going outside you think maybe it has something to do with the watching you're watching the twitch what do you think right so what this means is let's say that 80 out of 100 people don't have to worry about this okay so this is so what i really like about this is that you guys are picking up on a lot of different stuff right like and like y'all could have any one of these things right like chat you could be pregnant like you may have gout that's something i was expecting right so anemia is another big one i actually didn't even include anemia on this i kind of it was on my other list but i thought that that would be covering too many things right so you could have all these things i mean are any of these things that people are tossing out i didn't even talk about so the other thing there's a spoiler alert by the way i don't know if you guys got this but none of these are mental illnesses like you guys get this like these are not psychiatric diagnoses that's the whole point of this lecture is that all of these mental effects that we attribute to adhd anxiety depression i have trouble sleeping the truth is that a lot of this stuff can be caused by physiologic things and this is why you should go get a lab test this is why you should go see your doctor that's the whole point of this lecture okay next up oh yeah okay so what do y'all think about this one what is what do you guys think fatigue quick to anger feeling sleepy during the day okay poor quality sleep mode problems with motivation and problems with executive dysfunction malnutrition apnea bipolar okay chlamydia as i'm not even going to put that gaming addiction adhd alcoholism so we already have apnea here so we can say insomnia sure protein deficiency marijuana use yeah so like this is the thing right so i want you guys to really pay attention to all of the things that you guys are talking about that are mental so this one is sleep apnea okay so i even i don't think i even remembered did i even i don't have the prevalence of sleep apnea what's the prevalence of sleep apnea epidemiology here we go okay so this is interesting so 15 to 30 percent this is staggering in north america in men and about 10 to 15 percent in women so this means that 80 let's just call it 80 out of 100 people will be totally fine we didn't even get to anemia so anemia also causes fatigue primarily weakness you'll see like pale skin can sometimes cause like a little bit of a pain in the back of the neck so anemia is pretty common too so let's see what the prevalence of anemia is okay what's the prevalence of anemia can someone find out for me let me look real quick okay so anemia is a pretty common problem right so let's see what the prevalence of anemia is let me look real quick oh anemia affects 1.62 billion people 24.8 percent of the population that's staggering so we're saying that about 75 out of 100 people are fine with this okay so that's globally though i suspect i suspect that in developed countries the prevalence is somewhat lower anemia also is more likely to affect women primarily due to menstruation okay so let's say this is globally let's see let's see if we can find out in um well let's see in the u.s. yes so the overall prevalence of anemia in the u.s. is about 5.6 but i don't know if you guys know this but not everyone in chat is from the united states staggering or a developed country okay so here's the big takeaway i want you guys to pay attention to like everyone who thought like oh this is adhd this is anxiety this is insomnia oh dr k how do i find motivation how do i find this how do i find that you know like these are like oh i'm depressed i'm anxious the truth is that there's a physiologic likelihood of all of these things actually happening okay so now what we're going to do if somebody wants to help me do some math is we're going to look at so how like what's the the rough statistical analysis that we want to do to see how likely is any one of y'all to have none of these problems does that make sense because now like okay sure we can say you have a five percent chance of this 18 chance of this and how do we kind of do this calculation right so what we have to do is we have to multiply nine tenths for our first condition by 96 times 96 over 100 for our next condition times 99 over 100 times let's use the subclinical number because that's what i think is actually really important this population 80 over 100 times was that 80 over 100 again yeah 80 over 100 times and then you guys can decide whether we want to do 95 over 100 so who can do this for me right so nine times 9.6 times 9.9 times eight or 0.8 sorry hold on 0.9 0.9 0.9 what is this it's 52 percent okay so i want you guys to think about this okay so i want you guys to think about this 52 percent of people have none of this which means that any given person out there has a 48 percent chance of having one of these problems do you guys get that so it doesn't matter right now there are 4,335 people watching the stream we may upload it to youtube at that point so if you're watching on youtube i want you to look at the total number of views that the video has cut that number in half and that is the number of people who watch this video who has one of these conditions according to a rough statistical analysis do you guys get that like this is huge this is gigantic and so if y'all have these problems if you have difficulty with motivation if you have difficulty with anhedonia the inability to experience pleasure if you feel tired during the day if you feel weak if you feel like you have difficulty with your memory if you have difficulty planning and executing actions following through is what executive function basically means if you're constipated if you have insomnia if you're quick to anger if you feel weak during the day if you're a noob when you play dota you may have one of these conditions right so we're talking about type 2 diabetes which can absolutely impair your your negative function type 2 diabetes is really fascinating so when you have a high level of insulin resistance as you have a high level of insulin resistance insulin is the hormone that causes your your cells to take up blood sugar right so you remove blood sugar from the bloodstream it goes into the cell gets either used by the stellar cell or stored as fat so when you're resistant to insulin it increases the amount of blood sugar traveling through your body the unfortunate thing is that high levels of blood sugar traveling in your bloodstream is very very bad for you it causes all kinds of vascular damage because your blood vessels are not designed to have high levels of sugar like floating through them for a long time so there are studies on type 2 diabetes which show that after 18 years of being a type 2 diabetic you'll have all kinds of these like pro dementia like you'll lose limbs and things like that like i'm not kidding it's not an exaggeration but then people started to wonder okay what about is it is it a long-term effect or or let's look at a shorter time span so another study looked at four years so if i'm if i'm type 2 diabetic for four years what kind of cognitive impact do i get turns out it's actually quite bad now you won't get dementia but there will be a lot of like temporary cognitive effects that will happen while like you know your blood sugar is high and then people even did studies that were cross-sectional and for those of you don't know what that means it just looks at a single point in time so we take a thousand people and we measure their blood sugar and then we measure their cognitive capabilities and they still found impairment no long-term effects just one like a cross-section of young people actually there may be some long-term damage in there because we don't know how long those people had high blood sugar levels but i think the population was like you know young adults so it's not even long-term effects but even temporary effects of blood sugar quite bad okay so type 2 diabetes is like super prevalent 10 of the population then we move on to you know other things like hypothyroidism i think is a really good example of like a super silent problem that gets missed a lot especially like the subclinical hypothyroidism where they're not blatantly hypothyroid they're not like you know their hair isn't falling out and things like that that's what happens when your thyroid level is super low but as it gets like you know as you get to subclinical levels like not like a you know a complete deficiency but like low levels that's when we see this like low grade depression stuff is the best way i can describe it as a psychiatrist when someone comes in with this like low grade depression like they're not suicidal or anything but they just like don't feel like doing anything all day and are kind of bummed out and like aren't really happy and like not really motivated and they're just kind of like meh like a large percentage of those people i'd say in my practice like 10 of those people are like hypothyroid and i just start them on thyroid medication and they're like normal they feel amazing they're like oh my god i never realized that people like woke up every day and had energy this is completely op okay next up hyperthyroidism so that's quite rare but that can be one of the causes of anxiety so b12 deficiency is something that is also quite rare so like maybe we'll just so like maybe one out of 100 people or even less than that i would imagine but we are seeing increases in b12 deficiency especially due to you know changes in diet so like a lot of our b12 comes from animal products there are some autoimmune conditions which can also cause b12 deficiency which i want to say i've seen more recently i don't know if it's actually like on the rise it's still something that's super easy to get checked so just get it checked and by the way what you guys want to check in thyroid level is tsh um and then we get to apnea so this is another really common thing uh that oh sorry let's go to vitamin d levels like so next thing to check is vitamin d so vitamin d levels are also associated with poor outcomes related to covid messes up your immune system has a lot to do with calcium metabolism and like building bones and absorbing calcium from the gut and like all kinds of like random stuff vitamin d is made by sunlight so when we get exposed to sunlight our body takes that sunlight and constructs vitamin d out of it people who have darker skin color tend to have a less efficient vitamin d production so if you're like living in scandinavia and you're like pale as snow then you don't actually need that much sun exposure to make a lot of vitamin d if you're from india or you know south america or something like that at least the you know the equatorial parts of the world or you're from africa you may need a higher amount of vitamin d sun exposure to create vitamin d and that's just because in those climates there's a lot of sun so like our machinery doesn't need to be as efficient next up we've got sleep apnea this is the silent silent real problem okay so there isn't a lab there's not like a blood test for sleep apnea which you have to do is a sleep study but the good news is that most sleep apnea is like you know you can kind of get through a good to a good diagnostic threshold through an interview so like if you snore if you have like a thick neck i know it sounds kind of weird but people who are overweight people who snore a lot people who have a thick neck they can actually have sleep apnea and in men it's like 15 to 30 percent of men have this that's like it's nuts and sleep apnea is basically like you know imagine playing a video game where you never get to like rest right play dark souls without ever using a bonfire and if you play dark souls without ever using a bonfire that is what living life with sleep apnea is like you never get to like you never get back to 100 and so sleep apnea is one of the most the problem is that people can function like people are awesome right like you are a chad at dark souls and you're so awesome and you're so skilled but boy is the game like super hard like life is just hard when you have sleep apnea you can hold a job you can kind of study but like it just doesn't like your brain is like a colander and knowledge just leaks out of it right it just doesn't store things you feel tired all the time you get sleepy you're like kind of yawning all day and like pounding like coffee and stuff like that and then you fall asleep at night and then like you wake up and you don't feel rested so you can discover a lot of this stuff in a clinical interview so why you guys should go see a doctor you can do a sleep study then if you get on a cpap which is a continuous positive airway pressure machine it'll prevent you from being apnic and you'll wake up and you'll feel rested in the morning which is also like super op the ability to feel rested if you all don't feel rested in the morning you're living life on hard mode anemia is the next one so anemia is a good example like you know so sometimes we'll women are sometimes more prone to it because they menstruate you know but anyone can be anemic generally speaking in developed countries it tends to be like lower because we have high consumption of like meat intake and other sources of like healthy iron so anemia is an iron deficiency or a lack of red blood cells in your body so blood cells are like literally carry oxygen to all of your different parts of your body so it's basically like your fuel delivery system and so what that means when you're anemic is that like your body is not getting enough fuel to function properly so people feel super tired they feel like weak and things like that so everyone you know nowadays is like oh i feel owned right like i'm just like i'm just owned today like i don't feel like doing anything there's a lot of physiologic things that can contribute to this and this is something i've learned the hard way is like a lot of these people in esports like they have these problems too so i want you guys to think about this unless all of you think about your favorite team and like ask yourself do these people have a team doctor when was the last time they saw a doctor when was the last time they had a blood test because if the answer was like it was five years ago there is like a 48 chance that they have one of these problems that is a staggering it's not a perfect way to look at statistics because you know you can have more than one and things like that and some people are you know um and so like it's staggering like 48 percent of people will have one of these problems so 48 percent of like people in chat will potentially have one of these problems 48 percent of people who watch this video so take the number of views cut it in half and that's how many people have these problems it's crazy so there's a lot of low-hanging fruit in terms of improving your life has nothing to do with 99 of what dr k talks about has nothing to do with finding your inner whatever has nothing to do with like stages of change has nothing to do with insomnia has nothing to do with depression nothing to do with anxiety nothing to do with like some scars nothing to do with meditation meditation ain't going to fix this by the way it has nothing to do with any of this stuff it's physiologic and what i want you all to appreciate is when i show you the list of these symptoms everyone's tossing out psychiatric diagnoses everyone is tossing out psychiatric diagnoses oh it's adhd it's depression it's anxiety it's part of the problem with i think mental health in this country why is mental health getting worse despite the fact that medical science is advancing it's because a lot of our mental health providers have no training in physical medicine think about that for a second right so the average psychologist or social worker gets trained in all kinds of stuff that we actually get less training and they're actually really good at that kind of stuff they actually get more training in psychotherapy than an md does but 48 percent of people that walk into their office will have one of these conditions and generally speaking when i think about the average therapist i don't think they're writing lab slips right so it's like kind of problematic anyway it's not really their responsibility because your i you know your primary care physician should be taking care of this stuff for you right so your gp or general practitioner like your you're just run-of-the-mill doctor should be evaluating for this stuff but as a psychiatrist i want to say that there's a staggering number of people who walk into my office thinking they have a mental health problem and it turns out to be a physiologic problem and then you just start them on the right medication and it's like they're fine and sometimes it's not even medication right well in the case of c pap it can be it's like a machine in the case of type 2 diabetes it can be like dietary change and exercise in the case of anemia it can be dietary change so you don't even need medication for this stuff in the case of thyroid hormone usually need you know medication for that but questions is it okay to go to a psychiatrist yeah so a psychiatrist is really the one that you should hold responsible if they miss something like this to be honest because they're the ones who actually get trained in it right so social workers and like psychologists don't do it aren't trained in physical differential diagnosis they're trained in like psychiatric differential diagnosis and they're really good at that do you need medication for subclinical hypothyroidism you can that's why you should talk to your doctor about it right so it really depends if you're having symptoms what i would sort of recommend like i'll treat people with subclinical hypothyroidism with medication usually i'll give it a shot if they're having the the clinical symptoms and it's like they're like yeah i feel like owned all the time it's like okay let's start you on a super low dose and see if it helps and some come in and they say like yeah it's not really helping we can add a little bit more we like recheck their levels and that's like the practice of medicine so you guys should really go it's not just like a legal disclaimer i'm telling you all that if you guys are suffering from this stuff go and actually see a doctor because they can help you with these things y'all don't have to play dark souls on hardcore mode like you just don't have to you shouldn't play life on hardcore mode because you just have one it's hardcore anyway you only get one shot at it so like you got to play it as best as you can and optimize everything does weight loss help with snoring and sleep apnea absolutely yeah but i'm a gamer so so that's a great point trig etherage that's literally why we're doing this lecture being a gamer is no longer an excuse you guys deserve better this idea of the degenerate gamer is like the lowest common denominator that i also fall into assuming like huh huh huh a gamer like they're not gonna go like do anything they're gamers there's just energy drinks and being no like go outside like go see a doctor like you deserve better dude you can be a gamer like that's why we're healthy gamer we're not like abstinence from gaming we're like just like go and see a doctor like one day out of the year go and do a one hour appointment with a doctor out of 365 days in the year go get this you spend a second hour like 15 20 minutes getting a blood test 15 20 minutes talking to your doctor getting a prescription for maybe like hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism go pick it up take your pill every day and then play lol for eight hours a day that's fine like i'm not saying i'm just saying like use two or three hours over the entire year and then continue being your degenerate gamer self like that's all it takes and then the cool thing is you'll be more motivated so then like it'll be easier to stop playing whatever you're playing yeah so someone's saying i'm in the pre-contemplative stage of seeing a doctor absolutely dude that's why this is awareness raising right so well said someone's paying attention chat that yeah encouraging everyday drug use while also maintaining other drugs like cannabis is bad every day absolutely man because i know this is kind of weird so people like oh like he's encouraging drug use and like but this is drugs so i know this is kind of weird but what i'm basing it on is this thing called science right where we can do studies and we can take people who have sleep apnea who are literally for those of you who don't know what i mean i guess there isn't a medication for sleep apnea so maybe it's a bad recommendation a bad choice but like the other thing about a lot of these is that you don't need medication for them right but like that's why we use science like we use science to evaluate objectively what is the crap that you're going to put in your mouth like what is the pill you're going to take and like what are the benefits and what are the hindrances and so you should absolutely be scientific about it i'm not just advocating it i'm not saying all drugs are created equally i'm not taking telling people to take like chemotherapy out here right because chemotherapy is way more damaging than cannabis and yet it is still sometimes an appropriate recommendation so it's about like understanding science and understanding who you are and instead of like some kind of resistance to like it's a statement of resistance that i can advocate for some drugs and not advocate for others yes that is like literally my job is people come to me and i will advocate for some drugs depending on their situation and say like yeah maybe you shouldn't take that right it's like hmm if someone comes into my office and is hypothyroid i'm not going to recommend that they take birth control right because it's like especially if it's a dude it's like it's not going to help you drugs have their time in their place and cannabis is included we talked about that there's a time and place for cannabis but generally speaking it tends to be used recreationally so do i have to quit smoking cannabis see there is a pre-contemplative statement do i have to no you don't have to you don't have to like no one's i mean like i don't know what the legal situation is where you live and where you are and what the availability is it's just you don't have to the question is like what's it doing for you and how is it hurting you that's the real way like when it comes to gaming right it's like we're not saying you should be abstinent from all gaming like we even like i play games on stream but i don't you know today instead of playing dota which i would love to do because by the way there's a new hero the patch so it's very exciting but it's like doing what's important right so like what's more important like teaching chat that 48% of y'all may have one of these problems or like playing one game of dota because the cost is the same it's one hour of my time so no i mean no one has to give up marijuana like i've had patients who are dying of like alcoholic liver disease and they don't want to give up alcohol like that it's your choice right i'm not going to make you do it i don't think it's the right one you know your kids will miss you but it's ultimately it's like your choice you're the one who has to decide what to put into your body and i've seen this choice on the other end of the spectrum too where like sometimes i'll have patients with schizophrenia and i like prescribe clozapine and boy is that a tough choice it's a tough choice in the opposite direction this is a medication that will cause you to gain 80 pounds you will literally start drooling and it will be hard for you to write poetry the upside is that your delusions will stop your hallucinations will stop you'll be able to like wake up at a decent hour on a daily basis and be able to interact with other human beings and i've had some patients who are like yeah like i'd rather i'd rather take the poetry and get hospitalized four times a year and i've had other patients who are like it's really sucks i'm really sad i'm it sucks that i have to take this medication but i think i want to stay out of the hospital and like be able to have a dog because when i go to the hospital there's no one to take care of my dog it's tough it's really tough so i think it's but that's i mean that's medicine and that's life like i don't know that there's ever you know an always good choice the closest thing i can think of in terms of an intervention that works for just about every human being is meditation which is precisely why i teach it at the end of like most streams okay you
