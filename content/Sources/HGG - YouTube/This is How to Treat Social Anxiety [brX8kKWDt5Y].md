 If you're someone who's in a social anxiety kind of situation or you have social anxiety, one of the treatments of social anxiety is to actually give this person data. I'm not talking about doing research about reading about theories of social anxiety on the internet. What I'm saying is that if you actually want to perform well in life, what you need to do is give your brain data. Give it experience that it can actually learn from and adapt to. And if you sort of think a little bit about, okay, when does my brain perform optimally? It's not when I theorycraft my way all the way to the moon. It's actually when I give my brain data sets. And we sort of know this from like playing games. Like you can theorycraft as much as you want to, but a thousand hours of theory crafting is not a substitute for a thousand hours of gameplay. Right? And this is kind of what we see in social anxiety is that when people are sort of stuck in their own heads, one of the best treatments for it is some amount of exposure therapy, some amount of actually getting out there and experiencing different kinds of things.
