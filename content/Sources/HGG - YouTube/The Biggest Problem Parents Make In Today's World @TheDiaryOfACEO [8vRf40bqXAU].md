 So the biggest mistake that a lot of parents make is that they accept responsibility for their kids. And if we love someone who has an addiction, we wanna protect them from the consequences of that addiction. So we actually step up and we do more. The problem is that the moment that you start doing more, they will start doing less. Let's say you've got a roommate and there's dishes in the sink. The more you take responsibility for the dishes, what is your roommate gonna do? They're gonna do them less. The same is true. Because we're so afraid, oh my God, like if I don't help them with this, if I don't pay for your therapy, then you're gonna be. You're so afraid and so who's taking responsibility for it? You are. Let them ask you to pay. Let them come to you and say, you know what? I really wanna conquer this. I found someone but I can't afford it. Will you help me? The outcomes that you see will be drastically different.
