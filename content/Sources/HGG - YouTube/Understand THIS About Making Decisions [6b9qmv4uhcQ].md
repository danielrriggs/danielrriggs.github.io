 When we think about making the right choice or doing the right thing, we don't understand that these are actually two discrete cognitive tasks at play. So let's say I want to eat a burger, but instead I want to force myself to eat a salad. There's healthy option and there's unhealthy option. So choosing the salad is actually two cognitive tasks. One is resisting the impulse of the burger and the second is forcing yourself to eat the salad. So there is kind of resisting the desire and then there is choosing the thing that you don't want to do. The real problem that people fall into, the reason that this can feel repetitive and like you're not making progress over time, is because we don't actually focus on the two tasks separately. Let's say I want to renovate my house. Building like a new wall requires me breaking down the wall first. Getting rid of the bad thing is the first step to doing the right thing. The problem is in our society today, we are also goal-focused and outcome-focused that we just think about doing the right thing. We don't think about avoiding the wrong thing.
