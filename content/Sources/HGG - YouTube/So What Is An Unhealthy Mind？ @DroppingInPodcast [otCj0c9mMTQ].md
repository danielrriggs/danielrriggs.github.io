 What is an unhealthy mind? The most unhealthy mind is when thoughts are reality. So if we talk about people who are in acute psychosis, these people are delusional, they're hallucinating. These thoughts are by definition not real, but they believe they are real. So the distance between thoughts and reality is very small for people who are actively psychotic. Then what happens is we start to get into something like anxiety. You know they're not 100% real. You come back every now and then you realize I'm just in my bed and it's 2am. But you are attached to your thoughts, you can't let them go. So even if you look at the neuroscience of anxiety, what happens is when our amygdala is active, potential things feel more real, which is survival. It's adaptive. So when I think about like, okay, if I see a snake, I don't think about the danger of the snake is hypothetical. It's not a hypothetical danger. When I see the snake, my brain is like, oh, that danger is real. We got to treat it as if the danger is real. Even though I haven't been hurt, but I'm treating a hypothetical possibility as a reality.
