 When someone says I'm willing to try anything, we're not actually willing to try anything. That's crazy. I only want to try things that work. But let's understand perfectionism and procrastination, okay? The procrastination is a symptom of the root of perfectionism, right? So why is it hard for them to get started? They even laid this out. So if I want to be perfect, I can't get started until I know it'll be perfect. And so we can't get started because we're setting an impossible standard for ourselves because we need to be perfect. I need a plan that will achieve perfection. And I'm going to figure out the perfect plan before I get started because what's the point in starting without a perfect plan? Because then I'll do all this work and it won't be perfect and that won't be good enough. So why even bother getting started in the first place? So the procrastination comes out of the desire for perfection.
