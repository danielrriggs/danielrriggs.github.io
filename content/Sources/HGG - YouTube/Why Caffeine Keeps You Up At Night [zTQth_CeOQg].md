 But a lot of the problems that we see with caffeine have to do with the way that it interferes with sleep. And this isn't just falling asleep. This is also what it does to our sleep architecture while we sleep. So people who have higher levels of caffeine are more likely to have less restful sleep. We don't really have great data on what exactly it does or what the chances are, but this is just kind of my observation is that even having caffeine, like caffeine first thing in the morning for some people will affect the restfulness of their sleep at night. So we can also get into this really interesting problem where caffeine keeps us kind of artificially awake, which means that our brain is fatigued from excessive use, but we have so much artificial stimulation from the caffeine that we are not able to fall asleep. And what this creates is what I would call the zombie window. So the zombie window is when you are too caffeinated to go to sleep, but you are too mentally exhausted to make good decisions.
