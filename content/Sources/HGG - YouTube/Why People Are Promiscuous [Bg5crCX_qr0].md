 Let's just run through top reasons why people are promiscuous. Number one, they have low self-esteem. And so it's a badge of honor to be able to get laid in some way, right? There's an objective sense of like, oh, I'm a better human being because I got laid. And so like your sense of self-worth gets determined by engaging this in this behavior, right? Number two reason that people have sex is because they're afraid of being alone, right? So if there's like abandonment fears, and this is what I really see in a lot of like my patients that I've worked with, I think I had sex and love addiction, that sex begins to mean additional things. I can't get people to love me. And in the past, when people have loved me, they've abandoned me or they've hurt me. But I've got one trump card I can play to get people to stay, right? Which is why your toxic ex is happy to put out when you guys haven't talked to each other for six months because it's how you'll get entangled again.
