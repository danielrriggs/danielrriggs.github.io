Ans Yeah, Melissa Chinnichi is saying, I desperately wish humanity less hopeless. I get change comes from within, but it is hard when it feels like everyone else couldn't care less about being better. It feels that way. It feels that way. And why does it feel that way? Where do you get that kind of information from? We get it because the people who are the most hopeless are the ones that we see the most. This teacher, for example, is completely hopeless. And that's why she popped off. The text is Patanjali's Yoga Sutras. And even then, half the lines aren't even related to the mind. I think it's super simple. Hard to understand. You maybe talk about it one day. Okay, shall we move on? The reason teachers are leaving is not because of teacher pay. And I will tell you why. I'm a band director, which means I get paid more than most teachers. It's an incentive to show up and stay late, for sure. But it's not enough. Even if every teacher in the state of Texas got a $10,000 raise per year, we would still be dealing with some of the same issues we're dealing with right now. Let me just tell you what I've been dealing with in the last 48 hours. There's a list. And then you kind of say, like, now, right. So the first thing that we've got to understand is that it is almost impossible to change. Until you know they're a problem. So if you know there's a problem, but you're like, I'm aware it's a problem, but I'm not ready to change yet. That's actually like, that's half of the journey. But it's not complete journey. We have to reach our destination. So the next step, if you're not ready to change, is to really think about what it costs to change. I've been using instruments that aren't theirs, even if it's in a locker. I had another kid hit somebody else in the face when their trumpet was on their face because... The hell? Dude, TikTok just did it for me. Bruh. Bruh. It just started. Can you believe that? You want to talk about technology inserting itself? I didn't tell it to play it again. It just did it on its own. I was like, hey, thank God I don't have headphones. You'll get that? What I've had to learn how to do to survive in this technological day is to plug in headphones and take them off. You'll get that? Like, think about that. Someone at TikTok was like, if there is an idle window that is open for some amount of time, fuck them. Start playing the video. Do you get that? Someone made that decision to program it that way. We don't care. Bruh. You left? Why? Come on back. And you know why they waited like five minutes? Because they realized that if we start auto playing right away, the person is going to get pissed and they're going to close the tab. So I can almost bet you money that they tested. Some people start auto playing right away. Some people were going to wait 30 seconds. Some people were going to make one minute. Some people were going to make four minutes. And then they figured out that like five minutes, because I didn't close the tab, I just paused it. You'll get that? So this is what we're up against. The only way to survive is to train this. I don't even remember what I was talking about. Let's move on. Let's go chat. Right? So that's what they... Someone's saying you can mute the tab. So now there's like this war. I guess maybe Firefox is looking out for me. Because like there's a war between like, hey, we're going to auto mute tabs for you. We're on your side. And then who's Firefox competing against? They're competing against Chrome and Safari. So everyone's in competition and they're trying to win you over. You're the prettiest belle of the ball. And once they win you over, what do you... They get you. Right? So if I'm using this platform, they get my ad revenue, they get my eyes, they get the advertisers because I'm purchasing stuff. You don't want to know what I want to do. I'm going to run an experiment about whether you can mine someone's subconscious by analyzing their TikTok feed. I wonder if we took 10 people. I've been thinking about this recently. When we just looked at their TikTok feed, could I make predictions about what their insecurities are? Because the algorithm's really good at figuring it out. Is TikTok better at diagnosing depression than the psychiatrist is? We'll see. Those are the kinds of experiments that I want to run, but you know, we'll see, chat. So that's doable. I don't know if the NIH is going to fund this. So then the question kind of becomes, right, so this is where we got to rethink mental health. So here we are administering things like PHQ-9s and all these like surveys. We're like, maybe we don't need to. Maybe we can just let TikTok do it for us. Right? They're good at it. They don't even realize what they've stumbled on. I mean, they know what they've stumbled on. They don't, psychiatrists don't understand what they've stumbled on. You don't need Sigmund Freud to analyze your dreams. You just need to look at a TikTok feed. I'll tell you what your problems are. Right? How difficult is it to get funding? Depends on who you are and what you're studying. All right. That's why we appreciate when y'all like donate and stuff, like that goes towards our research. So we're doing like six studies right now that are all self-funded basically. Because we study these things because we think they're important. And you know, other people don't. They want to study what's a new medication that will improve depression by 4% more than an SSRI. All right. Let's see what's that. What's next? Millennials, you guys were brought into a world that promised so much but didn't deliver. Whereas we were brought into a world that was just f**ked. And we knew it was because of the internet. We've got very low expectations. We know the world's going to end in our lifetimes and we just don't really care. Like one girl in Sweden cared. And that, that made the news. We sent her around the world. Like look, one of them wants to live. Have you seen her? I feel like even the person who named the generations knew who we were done for. They're like, yeah, we're going to do it alphabetically. All the older people, they're Gen X. In the middle they're Gen Y. All the kids, they're Gen Z. I'm guessing someone at that meeting was like, hang on, what about the generation that comes after Gen Z? And they're like, yeah, good one, Craig. Come on, Craig. Time's running out for them. That's why we called their app TikTok. All right. So I'm going to do something. I'm going to, let's see if this plays again. Y'all, y'all help me out. Okay. It auto-played. Holy crap. I caught it this time, but it auto-played. Okay. So this comedian is hilarious and also right. The problem with the millennial generation is that we were sold a formula for success that did not work. So when I was growing up, they all said, go to college, get a degree, go to graduate school. You'll be special. And then with this thing behind you, don't worry about student debt, by the way, with all the stuff behind you, you're going to be successful. But what had happened is everyone had sort of figured out, at least in the U.S., that everyone's going to college and everyone's taken out loans and 18 year olds don't understand the value of a dollar. So we're just going to keep on jacking up loans and education prices and loans and education prices. And they even pass legislation in the United States that you cannot declare bankruptcy and get rid of your student loans. Corporate malfeasance, you ran your bank into the ground, you can declare bankruptcy. You can wipe that debt clean, baby. Let's go. You can wipe all the debt clean you want. Except for student loans. That's the one thing we're going to saddle you with no matter what. And so this generation, my generation, got screwed. I'm one of the lucky ones, right? Because my parents had enough resources to get me through things. And then the next generation, y'all were like, hey, the generation above us is like SOL. We mentally checked out. And now there's this existential nihilism. We even have a word for it. There's a class of people who embrace it. Doomers. These people are so common that we gave them a word. They're the doomers. Because here's what happened is that like all the stuff that was supposed to work doesn't And so now each and every person out there is struggling to figure out how do I navigate the world? And by the way, it's scary because like there are parts of it that are falling apart. And then we see a rise in pornography addiction. What does that have to do with anything? Number one variable that correlates with pornography addiction is meaninglessness. What am I going to do? Everything's falling apart. Guess I'll jerk off. And that's where we are now. This is not like a moment where Dr. K is like, and here is the answer. I have studied all of the yoga texts and I have discovered for you how to fix it. Do this meditation. Breathe. Download my app. Headspace. This one. Come do all these things. I'll fix it. These are answers. Say me 599. I will fix it for you. All these things are falling apart. Don't worry. 599. Oh, because of inflation. 799. Now because you are sharing with your friend. No password sharing. Get rectinoves. But give me the money. It's okay. I'll fix it. Don't worry. Problems. Don't worry. Buy this thing. I have to watch out for forever chemicals. I have a new pen. This is what we do on Dr. K's OnlyPens. Okay. OnlyPens. They have this new pen that has no forever chemicals. Buy this thing. It will make it better. Or your brain is busted. You cannot focus. You are failing out of school. Take this nootropic. I will do the brain hacking. Come, let's do brain hacking. World is falling apart. You are fucked in life. Let's hack the brain. Right? And brain hacking is just like what we do hacking in the movies. We go. And there's all those things and it's all bullshit. Same with brain hacking. Same. Because now we are going to do all these things and we are going to, you know, don't worry. I got your back. What are we going to do about climate change? We are going to send MIT scientists will send something into the space. They'll fix it. That's actually pretty cool. And this is where we are now. What are you supposed to do? I have no idea what you're supposed to do. Right? Buy more stuff. Do our thing. And we do that too. Right? Like we do that. You got to play the game. And it's like that's where we are now. So now like the real challenge is that you all have to figure things out for yourself. This is what's so damn confusing when people sign up for coaching. They're like, hey, I thought you were going to give me a plan. We're like, we don't do that. And then people are like, what the fuck, bro? I thought you were going to fix my life. And it's like, hey, bro, I hate to break it to you. There isn't a formula for that. We have to actually understand who you are as a person. And then once we understand who you are, then we can get around to fixing your life. And they're like, eh, not for me. I'm looking for answers. And then some of them drop out. Right? It's tough. It's tough out there, chat. I hate to break it to you. It's tough. Yeah. So we try, right? We just had a video come out recently about how to control what you can control in life. So we're doing our part. Right? And by all means, check out our Only Pants to get these non-forever chemical free pans. Only Pants. That's great. Right? I need a 45 minute Netflix exclusive of Doc K. playing that character. Yo, if you can get Netflix on board. Matt Lowe, I'm there, son. I'm there. On the DL though, I've actually started writing that script. If y'all can help me make it happen, we're going to do it. I'll stop streaming right now. Okay. Shall we move on? Is Only Pants for pansexuals? No, because we're inclusive and so we're not only for pansexuals. We're only for pans. The physical. The cooking pan. I have not seen the 90s movie Brain Candy. Yeah. Y'all. If y'all want to make it happen, let's go. Let's do it. Okay. Let's move on. Alright. We don't s- Okey-dokey, pokey-pokey. Let's see what's next. I really feel like we don't speak about this enough is people don't realize how often men are experiencing a lack of intimacy. And the only place that they can experience that intimacy is through sex. We've created a society where men are so afraid to be vulnerable with each other, to be, you know, sensitive with each other, to care for each other, to love each other. Is there anything I can do to help you? I could use a hug. I'll give you a hug. Seems like you got a lot going on, man. It's alright. It's alright, man. I hope we get to the place where guys go, oh, actually, I actually didn't need the sex. I need it to be held. And I live in a society where it's hard to be held unless I'm having sex. Sounds like he's- Because as guys you can't just go to a guy and be like, just hold me. Oh, this is nice. I'll never know how much. There are many sex workers who've talked about this where they'll talk about how many men will pay them and then say, hey, can we just talk? I want to kill myself. Fill this up. That is exactly how it works, by the way. There's no funding for men's mental health and it's the biggest killer for men between 21 and 45. And no one talks about it. No one even mentions it, lad. Men just kill themselves and no one cares. We need to change it. I would have gone with you to the end. Under the very fires of Mordor. You know what you used to be? No, Parick, what did I used to be? Nice. You used to be nice. I did you never used to be. Oh, God. Maybe you never used to be. What do you want to be when you grow up? Kind. Hmm. All right, chat. So real talk for a second. I know the music was good. I know Trevor Noah was compelling. But this is true in a nutshell. So male suicide has been a problem for like 60 or 70 years. It's on the climb. We don't really talk about it very much. And if you'll want to know, like in a nutshell, we can tell y'all, I can tell y'all honestly what I think about it. And it's maybe a little bit surprising. So the first mistake that we make about male suicide is that it's a mental illness problem. And this may surprise y'all because you're thinking like, hey, if people are killing themselves, why aren't they mentally ill? I recently saw a really interesting study. I don't know if it was a meta-analysis or not. Up to 60% of men have no evidence of mental illness when they kill themselves. Up to 60%. Think about that for a second. Because we assume that if you kill yourself, you were mentally ill. There is something busted in your brain. And when we make that assumption, we actually doom a lot of people to the path of suicide. Because what this study suggests, and this is what I've seen in my clinical practice, I would say up to 60% makes sense too. I would say about half of men that I've worked with who are suicidal are not mentally ill. What that means is that the world that they live in puts them in unwinnable circumstances where quitting the game is the only option. They're not ill. They're hopeless. There's a big difference. And the moment that we started calling hopelessness illness, we stopped trying to help those people where they need help. Because what we said is that the problem is in you. So when there's a man who is suicidal, what do we say by calling it mental illness? Hey bro, the problem is inside you. It's not your circumstances. Sure as hell it ain't my fault or their fault. The problem is in you and you need to fix it, which is exactly what we do to men. You have a problem in life, you need to fix it. You struggle with something, you need to fix it. And by labeling all suicidality as mental illness, we have done the same damn thing again. Because now who's responsible for fixing your mental illness? You are and to a certain degree your provider. It's your fault. It's not the world that you live in. It's not the expectations that you have to face. And so this is the really interesting thing. Anytime we have a systemic observation about a class of people, we try to fix the system. Right? And it's good that we do that. So I worked in a jail for three months. It was three weeks before I saw a white person as a patient. Think about that for a second. And what do we know as society? Does that mean that white people are less likely to be criminals? No, not at all. We need to fix the system. But there's one system that we don't fix in face of. Right? And that's when it's against the men. And we call it a mental illness problem. Now I'm not saying that suicidality is not related to mental illness. I'm also not saying that you should not seek mental health treatment if you are suicidal. Because even though 50% of them I would not diagnose them with a disease, doesn't mean that I wasn't able to help. And because that's where the help is. And so our society has changed. And by the way, since 1929, mental illness, I mean male suicide rates are increasing. It's gone from about 18 out of 100,000, I think, to about 22 out of 100,000. So we've gone up by like 25%. 20%. It's on the rise. And what causes this? I know it sounds kind of weird. Honestly, I think a big part that is underappreciated is homophobia. You may say, what the heck? Does homophobia have to do with male suicide? So when I was growing up, everyone was so homophobic. And so what are men not allowed to do? Touch each other. I remember when I first went to India at the age of 21, I had a friend who was getting married. And so he was like 28 or 29. I was 21 at the time. So he like, he was like, he was like, he was like, he was like, he was like, So he like, his friends heard. So these two Indian dudes walk up to this guy and he puts his arm around both of them and they put their arms behind his back. And one of the dudes starts rubbing his belly. So it's like three dudes, like one dude, like a dude on, you know, like wings of like dudes. And they're like laughing and they're like, oh, bro, like you're going to get married. And one dude is like touching another dude's belly. I'm like, what is this? This is gay. I grew up in East Texas. And touching another dude is like off limits. And so as a nation and a society, we became so homophobic that dudes stopped touching each other. And so then what are you left with? The only place that you get touched is by your mom or by a romantic interest. And why is that screwing up romantic relations? Because now let's assume heteronormative for a second. The women in our life are responsible not only for our romance, but are becoming responsible for the touch starvation that we have in all of the other dimensions in their life, in our lives. And so now this woman is responsible for fulfilling all of my touch needs, because I'm not allowed to touch another man. I've heard from school teachers who are like, I'm not allowed to hug my kids. I can't touch them. I've had patients. Mixed-race couples. Hugging their kid at a playground. People will call the police. If you're a mixed-race couple and you're a mom and you have a kid that doesn't look like you, everyone assumes you're a nanny. If you're a dude, everyone assumes you're a pedophile. It's wild. Because here's the thing, what people don't understand is that mental illness, even, or not mental illness, let's talk about mental health. Mental health, the foundation of mental health is connection. Our brains, in order for our brains to be healthy, they need other human beings. So what does our gut need to be healthy? Our brain needs a balanced diet. What does our skin need to be healthy? We have to bathe occasionally, maybe put some coconut oil on, whatever. We have certain things that our organs need to be healthy. You need a certain amount of water for your kidneys to be healthy. What does the mind need to be healthy? It needs other humans, or a connection of some kind. And now what we've done is we've reduced the scope of mental illness, or we've reduced the scope of mental health to mental illness, and mental illness exists fully within one person. And just think about this for a second, right? Because our science is getting better. We have so many more brain scans. We have so many of these evidence-based therapies. We have third generation antipsychotics, like Aripiprazole, which can now be used for depression. We have all of this stuff. Our science is getting better, and we're losing the war on mental health. Why? It's because we assume it exists within one person. It's the one organ of the body that requires someone else. And this is why dogs and cats have a protective effect on suicidality and mental illness. Because if you're a dude, you can't touch other people. You can't ask people to touch you. Even if I say it, there's going to be a thousand people like, ha ha, touch me, bro, like the pedophile creepy. You can't do that. You can't walk up to someone and say, hey, can I have a hug? What are they going to do? They're going to call you a creep. So if you really look at the research, you can see that there's a lot of people who are going to be What are the two variables that correlate the most with male suicide? It's isolation and thwarted belongingness. What does that mean, thwarted belongingness? That's a mouthful. It means this person is trying to fit in, and the world is not letting them. And I've seen this in men who are privileged. One patient, I'm going to call him Thor, because he's like Thor. He's tall, he's handsome, he's muscular, he's successful. And Thor is on the verge of suicide, and everyone's confused why. He makes seven figures a year, happily married, has kids. And what happens if you're a successful man today? If you do your duty, people come and ask you for help. Right? Because that's what a man's supposed to do. You're supposed to help other people. You can't look out for yourself. That makes you a man. You're supposed to help other people. You can't look out for yourself. That makes you an asshole. So soon he's taking care of this person, and now he's taking care of this person, and now he's taking care of his parents, and he's paying this person's medical bills, paying this person's mortgage, and the people keep coming and keep coming and keep coming. On the flip end of the spectrum, I remember working with a guy in jail. He was in jail at the age of 19. Suicidal. How did you get here? I sold drugs. Why'd you sell drugs? Because my family told me that a man provides, and I have to sell drugs. It's the only way I can pay the rent. Why are you paying the rent for four adults in your house? I don't know. They just told me that I needed to do it. Twarded belongingness. You try to do what people ask you to do, and you're not allowed to ask for help. And by the way, you're mentally ill, so take this pill. One day, at the end of a therapy session, I was in a room with a man, and he was talking to me. And he said, you know, I'm going to do a therapy session. Thor told me that he loved me. Now, this is a problem for a psychiatrist. We literally have classes about this. Don't tell patients you love them. And sure as hell, don't hug them. I've had some supervisors tell me that you should never touch a patient. There are good reasons to believe that, because sometimes people are traumatized and whatnot, right? So I'm not saying that it's bad, but it's like, now what? Like, this person has no men that he can say this to. And we've formed a bond. Now what do I say? I didn't know what to say. Because all my training in that moment, what did I want to say? I wanted to say, I love you too, bro. And then it would have been done, but I can't do that. So the one person that men are allowed to go to, and they can convey their feelings to, is not allowed to tell them that they love them. That's a professional standard. It's a made real fivehead move. I just started crying. Because I felt so sad. Because that's what I wanted to say, but I couldn't. And so I started crying. Turn on the waterworks, baby. Trump card. And then we had a good cry together. Right? And I think he got the message, and then we hugged. And I talked to my supervisor about it, and we kind of talked about it, and things like that. And this is the problem today. Is that we're not taking care of men. Because we expect men to take care of themselves. And even by labeling it mental illness, we're reinforcing that thing. Because then it's not our responsibility, it's their responsibility. And despite advances in mental health, and mental health treatment, and all this kind of stuff, male suicide is still on the rise. And no one's talking about it. Why? Because they're privileged. Why do we need to help the privileged? Right? And there's a good argument for that too. And now today we're invalidating their experiences. People are asking for help, and we're shooting them down. We're like, hey, it's all stupid mental illness inside you. And by the way, we did that to women for decades and centuries. And that was terrible. Centuries. 200 years. When women complained, we as a profession of psychiatry called it hysteria. You're upset? Girl, it is because of your uterus. We don't have to take your complaint seriously. Because you're ill. Your uterus is making you act that way. And that lingers today. People don't take them seriously. Oh, you're just being emotional. Whether you're being emotional or not, you can still have a valid complaint. The medical profession does this. I've heard horror stories about gynecologists. Who are usually men, by the way. Who don't take their patients seriously because they're women and they're emotional. Still lingers to this day. We did this shit for 200 years. I hope we learned our mistakes so that men don't have to suffer it too. Is that fair? No. But I don't want fairness in this situation. If we screwed up and we did an injustice to an entire 50% of our population for 200 years, I'd hope we can learn from that and not do it to the other half. A win here is not equality. A win here is learning from our mistakes. So if you're a dude who's struggling with suicide, by all means, go see a mental health professional. Doesn't mean you're mentally ill, but it also doesn't mean that mental health professionals can help. They can help. They can absolutely help. And it can be so awesome just to learn, hey, I actually do not have a diagnosis. This is an appropriate reaction to a terrible situation. There's nothing wrong with that. That can be liberating. And for the rest of y'all, try to hug someone that you know. Ask dudes in your life, do you need a hug? And for those of you that have been burned by hugging men, which I don't blame you for, if you're not ready to do it yet, don't do it. Right? Because this is the problem. We can't really blame women for this one because women are the ones who are going to get hurt. We can't really blame women for this one because sometimes when women enter into space and they offer a hug, dudes are so starved for any kind of thing that we don't know how to deal with it. And then we dump all of our needs onto this person. And we become inappropriately attached. If there's a starving dog at your doorstep and you feed it once, and you get annoyed when it comes back and it starts shitting all over your patio, I can't blame you for being annoyed. But let's understand that if there's a starving dog and you feed it once, it's going to come back because it has nowhere else to go. So invite the men in your life to cry. Invite the men in your life to hug you. And dudes, start touching other dudes. And I can guarantee you that that shit is going to get clipped. Why? Because we cannot listen to that statement without thinking about lol gay. Right? And that's the problem. Because the only part of this talk that is ever going to get seen is that clip. Questions, I guess. Right? Like people are saying, Oscars like start touching people up. Yeah, man. Because the memes is what spreads. Like, I'm not going to say that. I'm just saying that. I'm just saying that. That's what spreads. Seriously, I mean like, this ain't going to work, chat. It's not working. What we're doing is not working. I don't know. I just know what people need. Go for it. And for the record, it's not like, we talked about a woman like a week ago who is struggling with touch starvation. So we're starting to see equality, but in a really bad way. It's sad. I'm not saying that women don't have their fair share of problems. They absolutely do. Maybe even more than their fair share. But it ain't a competition. Just because one person has breast cancer doesn't mean that we can't have compassion for testicular cancer. And the right move is not trying to make it even. It's improving both of their lives. Yeah, so Josh Hutchinson is saying big virtual hugs. So I'm blessed. So first of all, thank you. I appreciate it. And this is the problem. Because what's happening in society is that we are getting technology to start fulfilling our needs. Instead of interacting with someone and purchasing groceries, I can have them delivered to my house without a single interaction. Instead of going somewhere and ordering food and interacting with a waiter or waitress, I can now have something delivered to my home. Instead of playing games with other human beings like soccer and football and tag, and I used to play a game with kids on my street called Multitype, which was like when you pick a brand of a particular thing and then you get to use that thing in some kind of imaginary competition. So like my brother picked Lego and I picked GI Joe. So like we were playing, he could use Lego things and I could use GI Joe. I don't even know what the game was. We used to make that kind of crap up. But now we have video games, so we don't need to interact with another person. And now we even have, you know, what used to happen is we'd like, if I'm struggling at work, I would go talk to a mentor and talk things through with another human being if I'm struggling. Now I have chat GPT that does a better job than a mentor can. We're substituting all of our needs through technology. But there's one need that technology has not been able to reach yet, and that's physical touch. And boy, when that happens, we're GG. Right? We've got devices. We have AIs, we've got waifus. This is all coming together. And soon we'll have someone that can talk to you, can listen to your problems. Someone, something. And there'll be a physical component. But so far what we're seeing is that technology is like a half life. It makes us like a vampire. It doesn't give us like the full thing. It just gives us a fraction of the thing. Echoing horror, saying we need hug bots. So yes and no. The echoing horror of that is that we don't need hug bots. We need hugs. We shouldn't develop bots to hug people. I mean, we should. We should develop bots to hug people. I mean, maybe we'll end up doing it and I'm not saying that it won't be helpful. Someone will do a clinical trial about the efficacy of hug bots in depression. They'll show a positive effect because I guarantee you there's going to be some positive effect. We don't need hug bots. We need hugs. Why can't we as humans just do it, bro? You know what may save us seriously is like cats and dogs and cows and pigs and pet rats. That may be what saves us. They're doing good work. I don't think we we don't really acknowledge. We talk about solutions to the mental health crisis. We don't really acknowledge that like we're doing good work. We don't really acknowledge that. We don't really acknowledge that. We don't really acknowledge that. We don't really acknowledge that like our best allies. Right. This is like, I don't know, like the Rohirrim showing up at the siege of what's that? I can't believe it's an embarrassment that I'm forgetting the name Helms Deep. The Rohirrim showing up is like cats and dogs. Like they're the only thing that's keeping us in the game. We don't even realize it. Do you need a hug? I would like one, but thankfully I'm lucky enough to where I've got a family that can give me that. Right. And the real challenge is that for a lot of us, we only get it from our family. And I got it when I needed it. But you know, we can't as men, we don't cuddle with each other. And that's a tragedy. Right. That's why we have cats and dogs. And romantic partners and to a certain degree kids, but only until a certain age. Right. Yes, Anonymous247 is saying, guys start families? You need help with that. And that's my point. As a dude, you can't start a family. Someone else has to start one with you. You have to join one. For dudes, it's just solo queue. That can be a sad way to play the game of life. There's this person in India called the Hugging Saint. Am I crying? I got a little emotional there, but I'm good now. Not to say that crying is bad. The other thing that you all can do seriously is like have a good cry. We're going to talk about this for a second. So sometimes I'll ask my patients and I learned this from a friend of mine. So sometimes I'll ask my patients and I learned this from one of my supervisors. He was at Mass General Hospital as well and was from down south. This guy would be like, when was the last time you had a good cry? He'd ask his patients this question. When was the last time you had a good cry? And then like something about the way that he said it, he was just like, he was some kind of wizard. He'd just say that and like people would be, they'd just start crying and he'd like hug him and there you go. Let it out. Let it out. Let it out. It's all right now. It's all right. He just like had this beautiful, silky smooth southern accent. And the thing is like we don't talk about having a good cry. Even the men that I worked with especially, they can have a bad cry. They can go into the corner of their house when no one's around and be in isolation and cry. That's hard for a lot of dudes. But the good cry is something that's really hard to find. The good cry is when you're crying, usually someone else is there and then you feel good. We know how to feel bad when we cry as a society, but we've lost the ability for the good cry. That's what happens in therapy, right? Half of therapy is the good cry. It's like the cry, and it's like, you know, and we'll, I usually like talk about hugging my patients and stuff. We figure out what the right boundaries are and then we'll have a hug. So I hope you all are able to good cry and give other people around you the chance to good cry. Just ask them, when was the last time you had a good cry? And people will go, what's wrong with you? Come on in, you know, and give people that chance. It's okay to cry. You don't have to fix it. Especially as dudes, we want to fix everything. You don't have to fix it. Just let them cry. It'll be a good cry. A good cry is when you're usually sad or in grief and then you start crying and someone accepts that and then you feel better. Yeah, and now we're seeing it in chat. Like, I haven't cried with someone since, dude, how though? I don't cry. I hear y'all. And this is where I haven't figured out, look, I'm a decently smart guy, pretty well trained, learned a lot of stuff. I have not yet figured out, and I'm going to work on it, how to teach people how to cry over the internet. Yeah, this person who's got, I think it's Cyrillic, the Eastern European Russian characters, because the corner is the manly way to cry. You're damn right. If you're crying at all, you've got to cry like a man, by yourself, where no one can see you or hear you. Is there a cry meditation? I'm going to try to figure it out, chat. People are like, I haven't cried in 10 years. Okay. And we see that sometimes on stream when we interview people, right? Like, so I know, we can try it now. You don't want to try it? Let's try. So the first thing is, it's really sad that you haven't cried in a long time. Seriously. Like, think about the life that you have to live, where you are not allowed to cry. I mean, sure, you're allowed to cry. But you can't actually do it. You can't blame anyone for not crying. People will tell you that it's okay to cry, but you know it's not okay to cry. Because people will treat you differently. And that's sad. And it's sad, because you're not allowed to cry. And it's honestly kind of tragic that you've had to carry this around all by yourself for such a long time. And there's no end in sight, and you've kind of given up on that. Because it's been 10 years, what's 11, what's 12, what's 13, what's 14? That's just your lot in life. You've been like a good boy, and you've just accepted it. And it's so tragic that you're missing something in life, and you've given up complete hope that it'll ever be there. You've just taken it off your plate. You've gotten rid of the possibility that you'll ever be able to cry. And the really tragic thing is you're kind of okay with that. You've learned how to survive being cut off from a part of yourself. And what's really tragic is that you've had to learn how to survive being cut off from a part of yourself. From a part of yourself. And you deserve more. You should be able to cry. And not be judged for it. People should be able to respect you, even if you cry. But you've lived a life where that just hasn't been an option. Right? And what are you doing now? Feels bad, man. Because even if I'm trying to help you get there, you don't want to go. And that's okay. It's okay that you don't want to go. It's okay that you're not ready. Yet it's okay you're not doing anything wrong. Right? Whatever you're doing right now is totally fine. Don't beat yourself up for it. I'm not going to judge you for it. I'm not going to say, hey, you should be crying. If you want to cry, cry. If you don't, that's okay. We're going to be patient. And whenever you're ready, we're here. You may not be ready now. You can listen to a recording of this when you're by yourself. It's late at night. No one's around. Whenever you're ready, you can do it. You can do whatever you feel like. It's all okay. Right? So some people are saying, now that got me. I did tear up a bit, but you can't do more. Don't no more. Just a little bit. Just a little bit. That's enough. Feel the lump in my throat. No more. So she is saying, you're making me want to hug and cry with everybody. Yeah, that's what we need to do. I met someone recently that I'd known for a long time over the internet. And I met them and my first response was actually just crying. Like I just started crying. And they started crying and then it was great. And we just hugged and then we like got on with our life. It's okay to cry. And if you all don't know how, it's probably because no one showed you how. Right? If you're a dude, anyone teach you how to cry? Did your dad cry in front of you? Did your dad cry with you? Did your brothers cry in front of you? Did your brothers cry with you? Did your friends cry with you? In front of you? Of course not. Then how the hell are we supposed to learn? What you did learn from them is your dad got kind of emotional. And the lump was in his throat and he choked it down. So what did you learn? You learned how to choke it down. Right? Yeah, someone's saying I took shrooms and it helped. I'm happy it worked for you, but I wouldn't recommend it. All right, shall we move on? Yeah, fist bumping is how men hug nowadays. That's the problem. Should fist bump with your whole body? All right. Let's do this one. I'm going to tell you what it's like to be a mom in America right now. I started taking a picture of my son every single day before school because I want to make sure that in the event of a school shooting, I know with certainty what he wore to school that day. I told my son that even though the teacher tells him otherwise, I want him to be the last in line if the fire alarm is pulled because statistically, it is a higher chance that an active shooter is pulling the alarm to lure the children out than an actual fire. I refused to get my son light up shoes because he can't hide in a closet if his shoes are lighting up. I'm adding a bulletproof insert to my kid's backpack for his school supply list next year. Meanwhile, people are more worried about their second amendment than my soon to be second grader. And yet still every single day, my son is expected to place his little hand over his heart and pledge allegiance to a country that doesn't give a shit if he's safe at school. I don't know what chat I mean. Things are so messed up in America right now. Yeah, I mean, so I'm with you all that it seems a little bit paranoid seems a little bit paranoid. Right, but I want to say that we've had something like 300 mass shootings in 2023 in America. So the scary thing about being a parent in America right now is you can watch that and you can think, wow, that that's too. That's. That lady's paranoid. But here's the thought that I think a lot of parents are having in America. Which is how paranoid do I need to be to keep my child alive? Right, because it's happening. There was a school shooting a few months ago. About like 60 or 70 miles from where I live, maybe a little bit more. And everyone you kind of know right like, oh, like this happening all over the place. No one thinks it's going to happen to them. Do you want to take that kind of chance with your kids like. I think there's we've done stuff on school shootings before like we've already talked about it. I think this is kind of simple. Like there's a data perspective. The answer is simple. And I think like even if you kind of think this through, I think there's some problems. With like we can give people more guns to protect them. Because I just want you all to imagine this scenario. OK, let's say you hear some gunfire in like a public place. Like a shopping mall and you walk in and you've got your gun ready. And you see someone standing up with a handgun. Shooting in a particular direction. What do you do? You pull out your gun and you shoot him. Right. Because they're shooting. And then a few seconds after that, you get shot. You're like, what just happened? Because the person that you shot was the person that was trying to shoot the original shooter. And was trying to defend everyone. And you just shot them. And then someone else walked in and saw you shoot them. And they were like, oh crap, there's the shooter. And they shot you. How are you supposed to, when everyone's got guns, how are you supposed to identify who the bad guys are? Like really, like I'm not trying to be political here. I'm just trying to ask. Like let's play the tape through to the end. Like literally, what do you do in that situation? Now there's like four people shooting at each other. Who's the good guy and who's the bad guy? Right. All of you are saying, turn friendly fire off. Yeah. So video games have controls like that. Real life does it. You can't turn friendly fire off in real life. There's no way to do that. Right. That's like, that's the problem. This is why you could play FPS games. Like do you all really like you all played? If you all ever played an FPS game with friendly fire off, any kind of FPS with friendly fire off is a train wreck. This is why all of the FPS games have friendly fire on right where you can't hurt your allies because otherwise you literally cannot play the game. There's no point in strategy. You can't just play the game. You can't just play the game. You literally cannot play the game. There's no point in strategy tactics victory because you're just going to be shooting your allies and it's GG. That's the world we live in. The actual real world we live in is that you can't design a game like that because it's fucked. The only salvation that we've got is that there's no auto aim. There's no aim assist. Only salvation we've got. Even DRG doesn't have friendly fire, right? Like I think if you hit someone with a bullet, it doesn't hurt them. They can take damage from grenades and stuff. But the other thing about DRG that makes it acceptable, even if you do have friendly fire, is it's three dimensional. I can grappling hook to the fucking ceiling. And I can build platforms and I can dig a trench. You can't do that IRL. The games in which there's some degree of friendly fire have like the ability for basically the characters to fly. DRG mentioned of course, DRG is epic. You all know what I'm doing with DRG? I'm waiting. Like I want to wait like a year or two until there's like a whole new set of missions. We're going to go back through it. You can't just sign up when there's just one new mission. You gotta wait till like three or four. Life has a bad game design? Bruh. Life has arguably the worst game design. Arguably has the best. I don't know. So the cool thing about life though, is that even if there's a crappy game design, we can to a certain degree change the rules. That's what's cool about it. So we have some command console functionality. We have things like science. You can at least party up and tackle problems together. Okay. Let's move on. Sorry y'all, the last one was too loud. Death is just the end. What's the point? What's the point in what? Living. Might as well just kill yourself. This one will need a higher volume, right? What? What's the point in what? Living. Might as well just kill yourself. So if you're watching a movie and you're really enjoying it, someone like Kevin Harting. Yeah. And someone points out that this will end eventually, do you just go, oh forget it then, what's the point, and just turn it off? No, cause I can watch it again. Well I think life is precious cause you can't watch it again. I mean you can believe in an afterlife if that makes you feel like it. I mean, I think life is precious cause you can't watch it again. I mean, I think life is precious cause you can't watch it again. I mean you can believe in an afterlife if that makes you feel better. Doesn't mean it's true. But once you realize you're not going to be around forever, I think that's what makes life so magical. You know, this place makes me wonder. Yeah, what's that boss? Which would be worse? To live as a monster? Or to die as a good man? One day you'll eat your last meal, smell your last flower, hug your friend for the very last time. You might not know it's the last time. That's why you should do everything you love with passion, you know? Treasure the few years you've got because that's all there is. I watch Ride Along 2 five times. Well you haven't wasted your life then. Oh. Beautiful. Gotta hand it to Ricky, your race. Doing some strong work there. Alright. So there's one really important thing to understand. And that is time is a scam. Okay? So if we think about what screws us up. Most of the time in life, it is time. Why do you waste today? Because there is tomorrow. That which can be done at any time will be done at no time. Why is procrastination so successful? Procrastination is a solution, by the way. I wait till the end, the last minute to get things done. Time in our conception and relationship with time causes us so many problems. So if I think about eating some food. The enjoyment from the food is in the food. Everything else is a scam. Oh, I can eat it tomorrow so I'm going to take it for granted. Therefore, I don't enjoy it. Appreciate today because it'll be different tomorrow. You know when everyone who's asked these questions, what do you wish you knew when you were, now that you're older, what do you wish you knew when you were young? People like take care of your body. Which is true, by the way. Why should you take care of your body? It's because in order to be healthy, the older you get, the harder you have to work. It's like an exponential difficulty curve. It's kind of like one of these games that like, there's round two and round four and round, they don't end. You just have to go through it. They don't end. You just keep going until you die. That's what life is. And it gets exponentially harder because your back hurts and your immune system starts falling apart and your kidneys are falling apart. And now you need dialysis and you can't think clearly because you have so much ammonia and nitrogen in your brain. Your brain is clouded. In your 20s, you could be like, eat shit. Don't take care of your body and still like everything works. Time is what screws us up so much. I'm 30 years old. Should I go to college? I'll graduate when I'm 34. Four years from now, you're going to be 34 anyway. I got a late start in life. Other people are ahead of me. Someone else graduated when they're 16 and I'm 18. I still haven't graduated. Time screws us in so many ways. So why does like all these people like would the... What do they do? What is all this crap with meditation and stuff? The point is to get rid of the dimension of time. If you can get rid of the dimension of time, your life will become so much easier. It's kind of weird. Say you're eating a sandwich. Can you get a better sandwich in the future? Are you comparing it to your sandwiches of the past? Both of those will decrease your enjoyment. This is a sandwich and this is it. Even if they're not as good as you, even if there's a food that you dislike, if it is the only time in your life that you are going to get to try that food, you will actually enjoy it more. Today is all I have. How am I going to spend it? And you may say, okay, if today was the last day of my life, I would live the most hedonic day of my life. And so even if that's the case, think about it for a second, right? Because we don't actually live to maximize our joy. We don't wake up in the morning and think to myself, how am I going to pack as much awesomeness into today as I can? We wake up and we fucking scroll and then a little bit of dopamine there and a spurt there and a little bit there. Now watch something. Now I'm wandering over here and now I'm hungry, so I might as well eat something. We don't actually try to even enjoy every day. We just avoid work because we can do it tomorrow and then we feel guilty about that and we manage that guilt with some kind of lukewarm pleasure. It's like a half life with not enough effort and not enough enjoyment and not enough of anything. And so if you start to live without the dimension of time, something interesting is going to happen. You want to go into hedonism and try, I'm saying have a great day. Treat yourself. Line up a great day. You say, what about tomorrow? Well, fuck, you're going to procrastinate anyway, so you're not going to lose anything. You might as well enjoy yourself. And once you start doing that, something cool will happen. Because the more hedonistic you become, at some point when you go to bed, you're going to think to myself, you're not actually going to think, this was an amazing day. Maybe the first day you do it. Second day, you're going to think to myself, I'm actually not happy with today. Third day, the more days that you have of hedonistic enjoyment, the more regret you will have at the end of your day. And then you will discover something really important. In addition to the hedonistic enjoyment, in addition to the hedonism, if you do something good, if you help out another human being, if you actually do study for a couple of hours, because think about when you go to bed at night, what are you the most proud of? What makes you happy and fulfilled? I don't know if you all have experienced this, but there's this good tiredness. It's like if you went for a hike, you feel tired at the end of the day, but in a good way. It's like I used this body today and it was good. There's some days that you do a good job at work and you absolutely crush it. And you feel tired, you feel cognitively drained. Or you have a fight with your significant other and you all talk things through and you all feel emotionally spent. Learn how to feel spent. That's good. That's the problem is we get confused between tired and spent. If you want to start like really enjoying life, and that's the cool thing, is once you feel spent, you actually are okay with that. Even if it was painful in the moment. You feel good about yourself. And then what will start to happen is you're going to start cultivating that because the hedonism isn't enough. And when we say live every day to the fullest, this is what we're talking about. Be spent at the end of the day. Not tired, spent. You may say, how do I do that? Well, you know those things that are hard that you feel spent at the end of the day. That's how you build your life. Because the more that you spend your days instead of wasting them, the more your life will move in the right direction. And don't get scammed by your mind because your mind will say it isn't enough. It hasn't happened yet. Our mind screws us with the dimension of time. I have so many patients who will start treatment, psychotherapy plus medication, let's say, six months in, eight months in. Their life is now good. They are happy. They are healthy. They're doing well at work. Going on vacation. They come into my office. What do they want to do? They want to stop the medication. And it's fine, right? So if they want to stop the medication, it's my responsibility as a doctor, try to do that in as safe as a way as possible. This is where I tell them, hold on a second. You've spent all of this energy to get to where you are. Just enjoy it. What if I'm on the SSRI too long? Talk about that. Here's the data. Here's what it shows. Chances are you'll be fine. We always worry about the future, and it paralyzes us in the present. We're so terrified of someone breaking up with us that we drive them away. If you're in a relationship, enjoy it. Enjoy it. If you're eating a meal, enjoy it. If it's not good enough, you can enjoy it anyway. Last thing I'll leave you all with, if you really want to understand this, because the yogis figured this out, it was brilliant. Mind has two fluctuations that lead to suffering. Worry, anxiety, is in the future. Regret is in the past. When your mind goes to those two places, you will end up with worry and regret. Then you may say to yourself, no, no, no, but in the present I can be anxious. No, you can't. You can't be anxious unless you're in the future. If you walk up to someone and you're anxious in the moment, you start to think, if I open my mouth, I'm going to be, I'm going to sound like an idiot. What are you actually thinking about? You're not thinking about the present. You're thinking about the future consequences of the present action. There's a physiologic level to anxiety as well, which can absolutely exist in the present, right? So we know some things from science that maybe the yogis missed. Maybe they didn't. But if you really think about it, you can't, and this is why mindfulness is a treatment for both depression and anxiety, because any time your mind exists in the present, you can't have a regret. I am ashamed. Ashamed of what? You're not ashamed of the present. You're ashamed of the past. The nature of it. You can't feel guilt over what you're doing now. You can feel guilt of things that have been done in the past, or you can have an anticipation of guilt in the future. We experience guilt in the present. The only time we experience things. So if you can free yourself of the dimension of time, you're freed of a lot of different things. Questions? Good night, Samuel. OK. Well said. See? Time isn't the cure. Time is the wound. I'm really cannot get up. Brilliant. Time heals all wounds. Time also causes them. Can I look to the future if I expect positive outcomes? My friend, if you are expecting you are already in the future. You can't have an expectation about the present. You can only have an expectation of the future. That is the definition of an expectation. For those of you that are asking about executive dysfunction and efficiency, check out Dr. K's guide to ADHD and doing stuff. We'll teach you how to do stuff. I hope you can read this, but have you ever heard about emotional numbness? Absolutely. Check out videos on alexithymia, which we'll talk about in a second. We're probably going to do something specifically around trauma soon. Can it be both? Let's understand how time can heal all wounds. In this text that we talked about earlier, Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, the first sentence or actually maybe the second sentence, is Yogacitta Vruttanirodhaha, which means yoga is the cessation of fluctuations of the mind. So this is what a lot of people miss. The nature of mind is impermanent. So no feelings last forever. We may think, oh my god, I've been guilty for 15 years and it'll never go away. Not actually how it works. Explain why in a second. So the nature of the mind is that it changes. This is why we get bored. Because the mind can't sit on one thing, it needs something new. I'm bored, give me something else. The other thing about the nature of mind, so if we think about a fluctuation, so there's a still mind and then there's a fluctuation. What is a fluctuation? It could be a sensory input. I see something, I smell something delicious cooking, now I'm hungry. It could be a memory, so now my mind is thinking about this thing. It could be an emotion. But the nature of emotions is that they don't last forever. So the mind also returns to homeostasis. This is the cessation of the fluctuation of the mind. And you may say, but what about emotion? Well, let's think about that. So how long does the happiness of your wedding day last? Groomzilla and Bridezilla want the perfect wedding. So I can have my perfect day of happiness. And if you have your perfect day of happiness, are you happy for the rest of your life? No. Unfortunately not. If you have a thrilling experience with a video game, let's say we're about to lose and it's 1v5 and I like come back and I'm going to be like 5v1 rampage and like, yeah, gg, last minute, come back. Does that last forever? Once you have one comeback in a video game, are you done playing the game because you're happy for the rest of your life? No. You actually need to play the game over and over and over again to evoke that experience. If it was permanent, you would only have to play the game once and you're done. Gg, I'm out. Games have figured this out. Nothing in the mind is permanent. So we're going to get people to keep playing. And this is what our life becomes. Since nothing in the mind is permanent, we have to chase the same crap over and over and over again to get the same result in the mind. Get high today, got to get high tomorrow, got to get high the next day, got to get high twice on Friday, three times on Saturday, twice on Sunday, but man, I wish it was three times. Got to queue up again, got to find a new game, got to do more and more and more. This sandwich is good, I need to find a better sandwich. So the nature of the mind is that it's fluctuate. And so how does time heal all wounds? Because if the mind returns to homeostasis and nothing is permanent, if we have a wound in the mind, it will return to homeostasis. And this is what we see. Studies on genocide show that populations who experience genocide, not everyone even gets diagnosed with PTSD. Some people are resilient and actually come back to normal and live healthy, normal lives. It's kind of wild. It's the nature of the mind to return to the present. That's how time heals all wounds. Now how does time cause all wounds? Because it is in that dimension of time that the mind suffers. So when you enjoy something in the moment, it's chill. In fact, your mind shuts off. I learned this most powerfully when I was walking on the beach one day. I was walking splashing in the waves and I was watching a sunset and it was like a perfect moment. Holding hands with my wife. My wife is pregnant with our first kid. She's quite pregnant. We know that hell is going to break loose pretty soon. Baby's coming soon and then it's like game is over, life is over. But in that moment, it was a perfect moment and it was just perfect. For me anyway, she was like eight months pregnant so she may have had difficulty. And then our mind adds the dimension of time. If I start thinking about the future and how I won't be able to do this again, it destroys the moment. If I start worrying about the past, it destroys the moment. Literally when people are filled with regret and shame and guilt, with negative self-attitude, in depression, food becomes tasteless. Life feels empty. I've been dumped. I can't taste food in grief. I become anhedonic. The food is the same. What's changed is your capacity to taste it. And no one says food is tasteless when they're like chilling in the moment. Everyone says food is tasteless when their mind is filled with regret. Or worry. I can't relax. Why not? Because I'm worried about the future. You can't be worried about the present. You're worried about the future. The only place that worries exist. The nature of a worry is that it is a thing that has not happened yet. That's the definition of a worry. The definition requires the dimension of time. And so with all this meditation crap, what are they trying to do? They're trying to teach you to come to the present. And once you start coming to the present, you get good at it. Then you become peaceful. And what's kind of wild is like this is why people with meditation can handle hardship. I was in the OR one day. Operating room. I was a third year medical student. And one of the surgeons got pissed at me. For many of my colleagues that would send them into a tailspin. Because my colleagues are like people who are straight A students. They're like, man, this guy's an asshole. That ain't on me. What's happening in this moment? If the dude gives me a bad grade, he gives me a bad grade. I didn't do anything wrong. I can't actually do anything about that. It's kind of weird. Oh, but you're going to get a bad grade. If I get a bad grade, I get a bad grade. I heard he's like honors in the rotation. One of his colleagues trying to convince me to be a surgeon. Because they realized that I wasn't doing anything wrong. I mean, we get so bent out of shape about crap that is out of our control in the future. I get a bad grade. I get a bad grade. What am I going to get kicked out of school? No. In the present, do what you can. Focus on the present. You can't get an A on a test, but you can study today. And if you'd never study today, you're not going to get an A on the test. Or maybe you will. Maybe you will walk in. And your answer sheet gets mixed up with someone else's answer sheet. And you end up getting an A. So learn to live in the present. How do you do that? You can start by meditating. But practically, it's just like be where you are right now. Right? Because if you think—the thing is we avoid the present because we think it's painful. But most of the pain that actually happens in our mind is not from the present. It's actually from the future and from the past. Because even if you think about it, you all may say, but no, Dr. K, I hate studying. What does hating studying actually look like in the mind? It's not the present. I'll give you a hint. Oh my god. It's been 15 minutes and I've only read one page. I have 47 pages to go. That's what hating studying looks like. It's the future. Oh my god. I've studied for three hours and I don't even remember what I studied in hour one. That's what hating studying looks like. I'm not saying it's easy and it can be uncomfortable, right? Because getting your mind to sit in the present because mind doesn't like sitting in the present. So mind is like, oh, this is boring. I want to be doing something else. I want to be doing something else. Now it's moving to the future again. So I'll give you all an example of how studying works when you're in the present. y equals mx plus b. When you actually try to understand that, how is it that y equals mx plus b? Why is there a plus b instead of a minus b? Why is it y equals mx? Why isn't it ax equals or ay equals m plus b? When you ask those questions, you're actually learning. And when you're actually learning, it's interesting. It's kind of like weird. How does that work? But you're not when you're thinking why or how does this work, you're looking at it. You're not thinking about the future and you're not thinking about the past. Right? All right, we've got time for maybe a couple questions. And then we got to wrap. Yeah, so you know, there's one thing, there's one big shortcoming of this whole philosophy that I haven't been able to conquer. And that is nausea. So here I was thinking like, oh my God, I've discovered pain comes from the past and regret. And suffering comes from the future and anxiety. You cannot suffer in the present. You can suffer in the future and you can suffer in the past. You cannot be anxious in the present. You cannot be anxious in the present. The anxiety is about what is your future. And then I got a stomach bug and I started vomiting and I vomited so much. And I was sitting there and I used all of my yoga training because my stomach was terrible. And I felt nauseous. And I was like, I've learned the yogic secret. Suffering is in the future. I didn't give a crap about vomiting five minutes from now. I was like, this is terrible. I wish this would go away. I can't wait until I get to the future. Please future, come now. I don't know, man. And I'm sure there's an enlightened person out there who maybe knows the answer to that question. I couldn't detach from it. And even when I work with patients with anxiety, things I teach them, like I'll teach you the secret. I'm Dr. Gay. Come learn the secrets of anxiety. It is in the future. And then they have a fucking panic attack. They're like, I feel like I'm dying. Are you worried about dying? No, I conquered that part. It just feels like my heart is going to stop beating. My heart is sending me signals that get activated when people are dying. And my brain is getting the signals. I know it's a panic attack. I'm not worried about the future, Dr. Gay. I'm getting the signals that I'm dying and they hurt. I'm like, yeah, I don't know what to do about that. But by all means, y'all play around with it and figure it out for me. And if I figure it out, I'll let y'all know. So one good point. So Inverted Goblin is saying actual vomiting is all in the present, just like orgasms. That is why orgasm is part of the reason they feel so good. So if you read these yogic texts, they'll say that there are two things that naturally bring the mind perfectly to the present, and one of them is orgasm. I was advertised a segment on Sexy Talk. Okay, maybe one day. I'm sick right now, which is, I guess, good. Okay, you guys want the rules of Sexy Talk? Okay. So I'll see how many I can come up with right now. So I'll see how many I can come up with right now. So rule number one. A lot of people think about talking dirty. So people think that, okay, talking dirty is sometimes creepy, right? So we'll see like these text messages and like, ooh, right? And it's like, oh, I've got like a throbbing, whatever, like a hard, whatever, a wet, whatever, whatever, you know, like some, some, some combination of variables. So it's not that, and sometimes people find that arousing. And other times people think it's creepy. Okay. And then everyone talks about boundaries and, and things like that. And, and all that kind of stuff, which is good and all that. But let's understand like the first most basic rule. Anytime you're doing dirty talk, you want to convey that you find this person arousing. So sometimes when people do dirty talk, they talk about their own pleasure, or they say things that they find arousing. Right? Like the, ooh, ooh crowd, but you're not thinking about the other person. You're thinking about yourself. And so even if you use the same sentences, who are you thinking about when you talk? So if you say to the other person, I am aroused, does that turn you on or does that turn them on? And then you may say, well, they're not interested in arousing me. Then don't dirty talk them for fuck's sake. That's the key thing about dirty talk. They have to want to arouse you. And then you start saying things. And then you're like, but how do I get them? How do I get them that you can't get them there? Then don't do the dirty talk. Okay. So dirty talk is for their benefit, not your benefit. Right? That's like rule number one. So think about the other person. And this is where like, but I don't know what they like. So that's why you've got to pilot a couple of things. Right? Some people like, you got to figure out like what threshold of word to use. And so you can suggest more and you can like, you gradually want to start with suggestive. Right? You can even say something like, here's a simple input, right? I can't wait to see you. I've been thinking about you all day. So early stage, you want to say that you don't want to stay at the end. Right? If you're in the middle of the act or towards the end, you don't want to say, I've been thinking about you all day. Because then the person is going to be like, what have you been thinking? You should be thinking about what are you, you know, what are you thinking about? You know, can't say, so you start off with like suggestive. What is it? That's not even dirty. And that's the point. And then you see how they respond. Right? If they're playful, they'll say, what have you been thinking? And if they're playful and they're aggressive, then you're like, I can't get it out of my mind, but I'm embarrassed by it. Right? And then you want to pull them in a little bit. Oh, what are you thinking? That's so embarrassing. Tell me more. Like 99% of the time, that's the answer you're going to get. And now they're inviting you. You get what I'm saying? You don't want to come out with it and lead them into it. Right? And Cody Bant is saying who needs a good spanking? That's not what you say. You'll get that. So start suggestively. And suggestively doesn't mean, you know, something involving genitals. Anyway, and then there's a progression, which I'm not prepared for in the moment. But that's like step one and two. Okay? Like you'll get the principles there. Right? And it's not like offensive because if the person isn't interested in you. Or they're like, you know, you like your shock them a little bit. You're also like, so let's say that they're interested in you. So then, you know, they'll, they'll be like, what have you been thinking? Because now they've made you uncomfortable. Now that they've made you uncomfortable, they're in control. If they're in control, they can be safe. If they can be safe, they can sort of accelerate or, you know, put the brakes on. What have you been thinking? Now you have me intrigued. And then it's like, well, look, honestly, get one or two drinks of me. And then maybe you'll find out that it's like, damn, son, good job. Right? Because they'll say, okay, what did we or they'll say, yeah, I don't think that's going to happen. You're like, cool. Sorry, I brought it up. And then you back out. Or if your embarrassment is kind of a turnoff for them. You know, they'll like, they'll take a step back. You kind of got to get a feel for where they are. And that's, that's the whole point is like, you don't want to, you know, push things. That's when you become creepy. It's, it's, it's about really about communication. The biggest problem with dirty talk is that everyone's like, it's something I'm going to do to you. No, it's not something you do to someone. It's something you do with someone. It's communication. It's empathy. It's paying attention to their signals. Right? It's not just like first do this, then do this, then do this, then do this. You have to understand what the principle is. We want to open up with an appetizer. And even before the appetizer, we want to open up with an amuse-bouche. And after the appetizer, we're going to move on to the main course. Anyway, Start with that. Anyway, I love y'all. Lots of hugs all around. Right? Yeah. Y'all will know what dessert is. Dessert is when you've been satisfied by the full entree and then you do something that makes them feel even better. So you can do some kind of, you know, fix them something to eat, cuddle, maybe a massage. Ask them, hey, can I make a sandwich? And then you can do something else. Ask them, hey, can I make you a cup of hot tea and read you Harry Potter book four? Well, we don't do that anymore because I think, you know, the canceling of Harry Potter. You want me to read you a story? You want a bedtime story? And like that's how it works well. Right? It doesn't end with orgasm. That's the other big mistake that people get. It's like orgasm, like, gg. Yeah. Everyone talks about seconds. Right? And that's where it's like, like intimacy is more than sex. Aftercare is OP. The canceling, the calling them of the Uber. People think that alphas will call Ubers after you're done having sex. But the alpha doesn't call an Uber. The alpha calls Uber Eats. Um, Himadrishakar Ganguly. I'm not quite sure, but if you've had an acute issue where you're like struggling to be normal, like normalize, then I'd say seek a mental health evaluation. Right? So there's this thing called something called adjustment disorder, which is sort of how we describe people who aren't mentally ill, but are just dealing with hard things. It could be something in that realm, but you probably shouldn't see someone. I guess there's a time delay on chat because you all seem to be reacting to. Now this guy knows how to get women pregnant. Okay. To be clear chat, I've only gotten one woman pregnant that I know of. So I don't know how to get women pregnant. I know how to get one person pregnant and knowing how to get that person pregnant isn't going to do you all any good. Okay. Is there some way to like raid on YouTube? How do we do this? Where do I send people when I'm done streaming? The wife is what I don't think so. If the wife was watching, I would have heard about it by now chat. Yeah. The wife isn't watching. It's okay. She does. It's okay. She does. The wife is tired of hearing my voice, which is what she tells me. I don't blame her. She has to like watch our content and then it's like, she's like listening to me. Like she's like watching a YouTube video of her husband talking. Right. And it's like, and then I like knock on the door. I'm like, Hey, what do you want for lunch? And she's like, it's just too much of your voice. Right. So it's good chat. I don't think, I don't think she's home. You want me to raid dragon, just raid dragon or dragon? These nuts. What if you sent her a clip? Don't set her clip chat. Look, we're on a team chat. We're on a team on the same team. You don't screw your team members boundaries. I trust y'all. I wouldn't be saying this if I didn't trust you. Don't betray my trust. If you guys betray my trust, I don't get to do things like this anymore. Is destiny. How do I raid destiny though? I don't know how to do that. Can somebody help me with that? Um, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Okay. So my wife and I are on a team. Walls of corn. But we're on a set. There's there's one game we're on the same team. And y'all are not a part of that team. Right? Let's be clear. If there's like Valentine's Day, Dr. K and Mrs. K on the same team, y'all are not quite on that team, which I hope is okay. If that really hurts your feelings, please let me know. And then we are on a different team. Right? We're like kind of like we're tight with each other. Live redirect. Okay. Let me see if I can. See, we're on the team where if I were to ask my wife to teach me how to do something on YouTube, that would frustrate her. But I can ask you and y'all are good with that because we're on the same team. I'm a teach y'all how to be happy in life. Y'all are going to teach me how to use the internet. Sound good? Okay. Um, let's do. Okay. I don't know. I need help. Okay. Well, maybe I'm going to have to figure this out. Chatting shambles right now. I hope he's not on live on YouTube. Who is live on YouTube? All right. Let me see if I can figure this out. Okay. I'm going to have to just make phone call. Hey, how do I live redirect? Not possible. I have faith in y'all. Y'all can teach me how to use the internet. Y'all can do it. Oh, you know, while we're waiting, let's play a fun game. I'm so curious. Okay. Let's do this while we're waiting. Y'all ready? Hello chat. GPT. Can you teach me how to talk dirty? Is there something else I can, can you teach me how to flirt? Okay. So it looks like. Okay. Do you think we can back end this in some way chat? How do I use humor? Avoid offensive humor. Okay. Can you hurt with me? Let's do this. Can I practice flirting with you? I think you are gorgeous. Let's see. Shut down chat. Man, I just got rejected by the AI chat. You know, when I was in college, I sometimes would ask people out and they'd be like, yeah, sorry, man. I'm not looking for a relationship. Today, I just got rejected by someone who was like, hey, sorry. I'm just the language AI model. I can't give you what you're looking for. You know, it would be hilarious if someone asks you out and you said to them, hey, I really appreciate the compliment, but I'm a language AI model and I'm not, I don't have emotions and can't engage in relationships. Oh my God, that would be so hilarious. You just told someone, yeah, sorry, I'm in a language AI model. It's like you're talking to someone on Tinder and they kind of turn you off. So instead of ghosting them, just tell them you're a language AI model and then unmatch. Actually, it's cruel. Fair enough. So don't do that. That's cruel. But I thought it would be funny. Don't do that. Okay, I can't figure out how to redirect to anything because I'm a noob. And that's the price that we pay, right? So I'm a noob and I'm a boomer. But what we are, so if y'all are interested in stuff, I don't know. Let's see who's live right now. Okay, I'm live. There's some Dodo that is live. That's everything that's on my feed. I don't know. Okay, so like just to give y'all a couple things. So if y'all just check out our channel, I think we had a video go live a little while ago. Y'all can check that out, I guess. Oh yeah, so how to gain control in today's world. So if y'all are struggling with control in today's world, check out our most recent video that was uploaded a day ago in which we talk about how to get control. And we will see y'all. We may actually be live streaming on Wednesday, potentially on YouTube. So stay tuned, everybody. Take care. Much love. Go hug somebody.
