 If you all want to understand the core definition, this is my take, okay? I'm not a personality researcher. What's the difference between an introvert and extrovert? It's where their attention has a tendency to go. Extroverts will naturally attend to things outside of themselves, which is why extroverts are actually more sensitive to workplace gossip. Their mental will be more screwed by a toxic workplace because their attention naturally goes towards the outside. Introverts, their attention naturally turns inward, and so that's a key difference between those two things. That's it.
