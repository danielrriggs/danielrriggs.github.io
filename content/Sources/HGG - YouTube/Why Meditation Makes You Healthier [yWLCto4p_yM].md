 If you look at all of the studies on meditation, basically the ones that show clinically significant change do a practice for at least three days a week, 20 minutes a day for eight weeks. So when I'm treating someone with depression or anxiety, I tell them, if you wanna see a substantial benefit to your depression, let's say what you would get from an antidepressant or an anti-anxiety medication, it's gonna take eight weeks of practice for three days a week at a minimum for 20 minutes. So I'd say that you should practice for, I'd say give it two months where you're practicing three to five days a week. That being said, I found a lot of value, some people feel great after three minutes of meditation. So I think a lot of the confusion around meditation when they say how long does it take to be effective, it depends on what you're doing, right? There are different kinds of meditation, and if you're not doing the right kind of meditation technique, it's not gonna feel effective. So the problem isn't that you're not doing it long enough, it's that you're doing the wrong thing. And so it's kind of like asking someone, how long does it take to get good at falling asleep? Well, it sort of depends on how you're falling asleep. Are you drinking caffeine before you fall asleep? Because for some people that doesn't matter, and for some people it matters a lot. Are you sleeping in a room with no noise or a lot of noise? Because some people like sleeping with the TV on, some people have to sleep in absolute quiet. Are you sleeping under the covers, or do you like to have like a cold room and under blankets? That's what I like, I like sleeping in a cold room with a bunch of blankets. Other people like sleeping in a warm room with a thin sheet. People have different ways to sleep. And so different meditation techniques are important because like you have to do one that fits your cognitive and your neuroscience fingerprint. The reason there are different kinds of meditation techniques is because our minds are different, our brains are different. And to calm the mind requires a different technique for a different kind of mind. And so, yeah, so someone's saying, I get really frustrated and angry with meditation, is that normal? Sure. So my guess is that the reason that you're getting frustrated and angry with meditation is because it's not doing what you expect it to do. Which in turn is the problem, because as long as you hold onto an expectation, you're not gonna enter a meditative state. So like, it's absolutely frustrating. Right? Like, yeah, because you're holding onto an expectation, the expectation prevents you from attaining the state of consciousness that meditation is, which in turn frustrates you. And it's because you're expecting. So the way for bigger B1 to meditate is for someone to teach him a practice and then tell him it's not, don't tell him it's meditation. It'll work. He just has to know that he's not, for him to meditate successfully, he just has to get tricked into meditating. So I'd say that a good technique for bigger B1 is, so I'll show you guys one technique for people who are frustrated with meditation, okay? Then we'll do something to help with depression and anxiety and help gizmo out, calm down your sympathetic nervous system. So this is what I want you guys to do. Close your eyes and listen to the sound of your breath. Listen to the sound of your breath. So your breath has noise, it has a sound. You should be able to hear something. If you want to, you can put your fingers in your ears and then listen. Then what I want you guys to do is try to spell the sound of your breath. So understand that all sounds can be spelled phonetically. It's not gonna be a perfect approximation, but what are the sounds, how would you spell the sound of the breath? So we would, for example, like the noise that a cat makes, we spell M-E-O-W. The sound that a dog makes, we spell W-O-O-F. And so how would you spell the sound of the breath? Okay. So now everyone's just typing out random shit. That's a great place to start. So then the question becomes, I want you guys to refine it further and go deeper. Is the sound of inhalation different from the sound of exhalation? Right? So then what are those two sounds? So now what I want you guys to realize is that chances are that the sound of the breath is different from the sound of the exhalation. So now what I want you guys to do is what I want you guys to realize is that chances are, and this is gonna be hard to understand, but the more you listen to it, the more you're gonna be able to refine the sound. You guys are tossing out an answer because that's your first impression. But the closer that you listen, like just look at what everyone's typing. There are like a lot of different dimensions that people are covering. Some people are using Hs, some people are using S, some people are using multiple vowels, some people are using one vowel. There are M's, there's, so like just listen and try to see if anything that I want is typed in Twitch chat, can you hear their sound? Okay, so now what I want you guys to do is stop typing in Twitch chat, close your eyes and just listen. Okay, now I'm gonna teach you guys, have we done Darth Vader breath yet? Ha ha, what's the right answer? You guys do it for a month and then get back to me. Okay, so now we're gonna do the breath. So, do it for a month and see, like do it every day for one month and see if you understand. So like understanding the sound of the breath is like expanding your palate, right? Like the more you train your palate, the more you'll be able to detect. And so the more you listen, the more you'll get. Like it's like, you know, if you have an unsophisticated palate and someone feeds you something and you eat it and you're like, yeah, that was delicious. That's what you guys are doing. You're like, ah, this is delicious. This is the sound. So understand it deeper, listen to it, really listen to it. And then once you feel like after you do one week of this practice, the second step is to see or listen, where do you hear the sound of the breath in the external world? The sound of the breath is present in other places. Can you find out where? Where do you hear it? It's not just the sound of the breath. It exists in other things. Is to go looking for it. But in order to find the sound of the breath, you really have to understand what it looks like or what it sounds like. You really have to be able to detect it and understand it well within yourself before you are able to find it in other places. Yeah, stalkerino. Okay, so now I'm gonna teach you guys Darth Vader breathing technique, okay? And it's hard to describe how to do this technique except to breathe like Darth Vader. So this technique is called Ujjayi Pranayam. And what it is, it involves contraction. I would say do it for three to five minutes at a time. So it involves contraction of the throat. It involves contraction of the throat in a way that produces this sound. And if you guys wanna know how to understand that with the throat, with the throat. So if you wanna know how to make that sound, you have to breathe like Darth Vader, right? So you go like this. Ah. So when you do, when you make the Darth Vader sound, you're gonna, when your mind tells you to breathe like Darth Vader, it's gonna automatically contract something in your throat. That's what you wanna contract. So take a snapshot of how Darth Vader breathing, what it does to your throat, and then do that to your throat and then breathe normally with that contraction. Okay, and then close your eyes. Close your eyes and practice. We're gonna practice for three minutes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Go ahead and finish the breath that you're on. Let your eyes remain closed. You sit with the feeling. Sit with the person that you are in this moment. Sit with the person that you are in this moment. Sit with the person that you are in this moment. Sit with the person that you are in this moment. Sit with the person that you are in this moment. Sit with the person that you are in this moment. Sit with the person that you are in this moment. Sit with the person that you are in this moment. Sit with the person that you are in this moment. Sit with the person that you are in this moment. Sit with the person that you are in this moment. Sit with the person that you are in this moment. Sit with the person that you are in this moment. Sit with the person that you are in this moment. Sit with the person that you are in this moment. Sit with the person that you are in this moment. Sit with the person that you are in this moment. Sit with the person that you are in this moment. Sit with the person that you are in this moment. Sit with the person that you are in this moment. Sit with the person that you are in this moment. Sit with the person that you are in this moment. Now sit with the person that you are in this moment. Now sit with the person that you are in this moment. Sit with the person that you are in this moment. Now sit with the person that you are in this moment. Ok. Go ahead and let yourself come back. Okay. So thank you all for coming. Thank you for listening and participating. And we're going to go ahead and wrap up for the day. If anyone has a suggestion for who to raid, we'll do that. So I think just to kind of recap, you know, today's stream was about a little bit about lupus, a little bit about anxiety, a little bit about how to change our diet and to sort of optimize our health, what helps with inflammation, but also how to enact simple behavioral changes. How is it like, sure, we should eat certain things, but how do we go about eating those things? A little bit about the origins of anxiety and a little bit about meditation.
