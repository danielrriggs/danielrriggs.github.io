 And so if you want to develop a healthy relationship with anger, start by understanding the difference between healthy and unhealthy anger. And then furthermore, employ some of these techniques to really understand where your expectations come from. And even when you're feeling angry, how to not let it control you. Even if anger is appropriate and someone violates your boundary, we still want to be in control of it, right? And that's where we can use some of these things like breathing techniques or even taking a step away, because oftentimes we don't need to act then and there, right? We can literally step away for like five minutes or ten minutes or fifteen minutes or a day or a week or whatever, and then come back to the situation and sort of channel that anger in a healthy way where you can say, hey, I really think what you did was inappropriate and I consider it to be like a violation of my boundaries. I really don't think it's fair or appropriate for you to behave this way with me at all. You can sort of feel that anger in there, but don't let it get control of you. And then you can sort of like lay a boundary with them, right?
