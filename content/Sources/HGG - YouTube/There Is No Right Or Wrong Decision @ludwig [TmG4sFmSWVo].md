 Some people go through life and in their mind, there is a right decision or a wrong decision. And their happiness or security is determined by the decision. And since there's so much weight in the decision, you're paralyzed. Because if you choose wrong, the rest of your life is screwed. It's so deterministic. There's no adaptation, there's no modification. I'm sort of the same way. And I think a lot of my confidence comes from, I would use the word faith that things will be okay. I don't determine whether I'm successful or not. All I determine is what my actions are and that's what I'm gonna focus on. Yeah, I think there's no wrong decisions. I think that's where a lot of your confidence comes from or vice versa. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's dope. Yeah, I think it's dope too.
