 Right now, like so many people are taking advantage of these like traditional work environments. And as more people take advantage of it, we have a generation of people who are just checking out. They're like, this doesn't work for me. Like this is not worth it. You know, if you look at things like, you know, wages, like, for example, teacher wages, so teacher wages have not kept up with inflation at all. And then on top of that, we have this like growing technological crisis, where kids are becoming more dysregulated than they've ever been. We also have all kinds of like fear of lawsuits. So teachers cannot discipline kids. And so we're seeing an absolute collapse. I don't know if like people are seeing it like economically, but I'm seeing it on the level of like teachers who are burnt out. And like students who are really struggling, like parents come to me, no one knows what to do. And like the school systems in the United States are getting absolutely screwed. So I think what we're seeing is a whole scale failure of our traditional institutions.
