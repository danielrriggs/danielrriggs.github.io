 And as you go to a party, there'll be a little voice in your head that says, Hey, you're not worth being friends with. Hey, people don't like you. This is a lesson that you learned. And that's what a lack of confidence looks like, right? It manifests in the moment and tells you something about yourself. It says, Hey, these other people can do this, but you can't because they are this way and you were this way. And so what you'll see is these lessons that you learned early in life will manifest in your mind and will prevent you from actually acting. And then you can struggle with that lack of confidence. Sometimes you can overcome it. Sometimes you can't. So the next thing that we need to do is when that lack of confidence surfaces, we need to pause, don't fight it. Don't overcome it. Don't conquer it. Just sit with it and say, Hey, okay, hold on a second. Here's that lack of confidence. Here's that feeling. And this is what, if you pay attention, it'll be an image, an echo, a mirror. It'll be like a little piece of that. It's that emotional energy that is unprocessed and stored in your mind.
