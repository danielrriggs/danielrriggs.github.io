 This is the most bizarre thing that I discovered, and this was through a lot of introspection, is that the tasks that actually burn us out, if we actually bang out even half an hour of them or an hour of them on the weekends, it can be so mentally freeing. It's like the feeling of checking things off your list and now you're going into Monday morning and you don't have to worry about that stuff. Because what is it that really burns you out? It's having to worry about that stuff. And then since you're grappling with that crap, you can't focus on the work that you actually enjoy, your creative work takes a dip. And once your creative work takes a dip, that's the reason that you're actually there, then you're not producing at the level that you really want to. And as you're not producing at the level that you really want to, you get increasingly frustrated and that sort of leads to burnout. So I know it's quite paradoxical, but one of the things that I've really discovered is that working seven days a week not only reduces my burnout, it actually makes me like more productive and makes me feel more invigorated and also frees me up during the week to focus on the tasks that I really want to at work.
