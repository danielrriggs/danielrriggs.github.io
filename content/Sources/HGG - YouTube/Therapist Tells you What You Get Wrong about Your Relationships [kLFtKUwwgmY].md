 So every dish in the sink that your partner cleans for you, you don't weigh that benefit as much as what you weigh when you do a dish for them. So there's a lopsided measurement. And so that's where I don't think that enforced 50-50 is good, or even 60-40 or 70-30. Over time, I don't think the quantification of it really matters too much because there's just the instrument of your measurement is going to be prone to cognitive bias. Marriage is a 60-40 kind of thing. You give 60 and you get 40. And your partner gives 60 and gets 40. And that's what marriage feels like.
