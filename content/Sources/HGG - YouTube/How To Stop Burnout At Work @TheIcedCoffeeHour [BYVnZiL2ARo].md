 So what burns out employees is when they try really hard, and then their boss doesn't see their value. It's not the effort is the dashed effort, the solution to burnout is not to actually reduce your workload, because that doesn't sort of work. Because what happens is, when people reduce their workload by going on a vacation, then they come back and they're like back to the grind. And then even if they start like reducing their workload, it sort of doesn't work out, it can. But what really works well is detaching, sort of saying like, okay, this is the most that I'm willing to do. And like the rest of it can go sort itself out. Like I'm not responsible for this thing being successful, right? I work on a team with six people, I'm not responsible for the success of the project, the more that one person on a team of six feels responsible for the success of the project, the more burnt out they're going to be. So you just do your part, you recognize this is my part, I'm even going to do more than my part, I'll do 20% of the work, even though I'm one out of a team of six. And that's okay, you won't get burnt out.
