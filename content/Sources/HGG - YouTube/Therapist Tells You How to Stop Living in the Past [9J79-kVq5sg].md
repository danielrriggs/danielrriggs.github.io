 So when you actually accept, what it helps you do is sit in the present and then actually look forward to the future in a positive way. Whereas learned helplessness is all about making an assumption about the future that makes you not act today. And this is what's really confusing about acceptance is a lot of people think, okay, if I accept that I failed out of college, doesn't that mean that I don't do anything? No, actually the opposite. So when you accept that you failed college, okay, here I am now, I failed out of college. What am I gonna do about it? Where do I go from here? And then there's a natural tendency to start looking to the future in sort of a positive way. But even looking to the future is not about looking out here, it's about, okay, what can I do now? What's the first step that I can take? That'll help me put my life together.
