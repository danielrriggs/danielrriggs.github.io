 How do you develop friendships as a dude? So I think the first problem with this is that there's this idea that we develop friendships. I don't think that's how male bonds actually form. There isn't like sort of this intentional development. I think the biggest thing about developing friendships as a man is you walk up to another dude and you say literally, hey, you want to hang out sometime. There doesn't need to be an important subtext. There doesn't need to be an emphasis on like long-term engagement or becoming vulnerable. In fact, the extent of vulnerability for friendships with men at the very beginning is, hey, do you want to hang out sometime?
