 The yogis taught us a really, really simple way to detect the action of ego, comparison. So anytime you make comparative statements, that is the action of ego. This other person would be able to get this job, but I would not. This other person is smarter, but I'm this. This person is this way, I'm this way. Even if that is objectively true on some level, right? So the ego is not false, it's not delusional. It's just selective, right? So ego is kind of like statistics. So I once had a statistics professor who said, statistics are like a bikini. What they reveal is enticing, but what they conceal is vital. And ego is the same way. Ego gives you a lot of the information, but it leaves out key portions of the information. And it's in that that we make our critical mistakes, right? Because when your ego tells you, oh yeah, this person wouldn't go out with you anyway, you're a loser. But your ego is conveniently leaving out that you got information that this person actually has a crush on you and is interested in dating you. But the ego is like, no, we're gonna just push that away.
