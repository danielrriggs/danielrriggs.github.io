 If we look at what technology is doing to our brains, the first thing that it's doing is it is externalizing our attention. So if you look back, like let's say a thousand years ago, as human beings, we spent a lot more time with ourselves. So let's say that you and I go out hunting. Let's say you shoot an arrow at a deer and you miss, and then I shoot an arrow at a deer and I hit. So in this moment, I'm superior to you. And then we pick up the deer and we're carrying it back, and then we have about two or three hours to take that emotional insult and we kind of process it. We just give our mind space to process it, which it does automatically. Now, if you look at what happens in people's days, they don't actually have any time to process what happens to them because we are so constantly distracted by external things. We lose sight of our internal signals, literally in the same way that if you raise a child in a dark cave, the photoreceptors in their eyes won't develop, they will atrophy. Anything that the mind does not get access to will start to atrophy. If I don't practice Spanish, I'm gonna forget Spanish. The brain is a very efficient organ.
