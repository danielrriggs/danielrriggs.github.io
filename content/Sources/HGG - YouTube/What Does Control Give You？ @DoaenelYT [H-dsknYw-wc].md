 So you've figured out this strategy of life, which is like I'm gonna be a Chad. I'm gonna be the best, right? Yep. And as you become more and closer and closer to the best, like how do you feel about yourself? Like I could be better. Like so why be best in the first place? I think that becoming the best isn't something that you can ever truly achieve so much as it is a mentality that you're in. Has nothing to do with my question. Why become best in the first place? Because it gives you purpose. What's the point of purpose? It gives you a reason to look forward to something. And what are you looking forward to? Something that only you can control, which is things that you grind for. Okay. So I'm not hearing happiness. I'm not hearing contentment. I'm not hearing being able to be present. I know you want those things. I think you're right with everything that you've said. So it's giving you a reason to wake up. It's giving you the capacity for control. And what does control give you? It gives you security. If you have security, it gives you freedom. And if you have security, no one's gonna get to hurt you. Yes. You are invincible. And so your whole life is about the avoidance of hurt.
