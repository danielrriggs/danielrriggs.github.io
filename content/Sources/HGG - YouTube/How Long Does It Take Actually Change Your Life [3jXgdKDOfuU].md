 How long does it take to actually make a substantial change in your life? Can you get it after 15 or 20 minutes of a stream or a YouTube video or whatever? Can you get it from a year of watching YouTube? How many years and hours of content do you have to consume for you to be transformed? Owa Koka is saying you can do it overnight if the circumstances require it. 100% agree. So then the question is, how do you get yourself in a situation where the circumstances require it? It doesn't make sense putting it that way because it is you who has to take the action. Yes, we agree. But this is the problem that people make when it comes to taking an action. It is I who has to do the action. Agreed, 100%. But you don't have to do it alone. So when I go to the gym, it's me who has to lift the weights, but a personal trainer helps a lot. The outcomes are better when you work with a personal trainer. They're not doing any of the weightlifting for you, but there are all kinds of factors around the weightlifting that they can smooth out.
