 Hey Dr. K, after my first relationship, I've had a lot of success with, let's say, superficial dating, which grew old fairly fast. And now, after having been in a lot of those, I haven't been able to find anyone to have something deeper anymore. What should I do? So if you've had a meaningful relationship, followed by a string of empty or shallow relationships, two options. One is that you haven't found the right person, right? Which is very possible. The second, though, is that you're not really emotionally open to something deeper. The main question is, how did your first relationship end, and have you really fully recovered from that? Do you have space in you for another relationship like that? And oftentimes what happens when our first relationship ends is we get kind of scarred over, right? This is what happens. Anytime we have a wound, the body and the mind will scar over it. And so if you're having trouble forming a connection, I'd really look at what was the aftermath of your first relationship. And are you really ready to meet someone, or do you want to be in that kind of relationship again? Because you may not be ready yet. You may not want it. So I kind of process the old relationship and make sure that you're emotionally available for a new one.
