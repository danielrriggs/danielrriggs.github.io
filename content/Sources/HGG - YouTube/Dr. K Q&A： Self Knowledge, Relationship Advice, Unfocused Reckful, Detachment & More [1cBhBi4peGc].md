 I can be as I can train or study as much as I want to and like what do I know about your life like I don't know anything about your life right but I had a question about how to keep the relationship flame going I mean I so I think the people need to understand that you don't have to have like a particular problem to go to therapy he can get there and you can too that I think is a very important lesson right that's the final boss when the final boss shows up you don't just like say oh fuck fuck this I'm done so that's fucking twitch's problem right is that like half y'all are giver uppers this is the other thing is that a lot of people live their life based on the imagined emotions of other people sometimes I feel I can do everything and someday soon I feel I can't because I have a fear of failure how do I deal with this right it's just not meditation to remove yourself from the negative it's meditation to remove yourself from the positive too uh what about listening to music while doing intense doing brain intensive work like studying coding algorithm questions I like to listen to techno while doing coding practice but recently I've started to experiment with not listening to music to see if it will help me focus better so I think here's the thing so oh wow thank you for the the gifted subs confused monkey and keep our scam train going guys so um I think the key thing so this person's saying like I listen to techno while I'm doing coding practice but recently I've started to experiment with not listening to music uh to see if it will help me focus better what do you think um so I think the more most important thing is that you experiment right like the it's not about what I think is right or wrong so like you guys have to understand this okay so people come to the stream and they think that this is about expertise right but it's not like I can be as I can train or study as much as I want to and like what do I know about your life like I don't know anything about your life right not true but um when it when it really comes down to it it's like you guys should experiment with the stuff that I do like don't take what I say as gospel like this isn't that's not what we're trying to do here like the goal is to give you guys options for you to experiment and then like figure out what works for you so I'm the same way sometimes I like to work while doing music I tend to work really well in some ways some kinds of cognitive activity I think go well with music other kinds of cognitive activity I like silence or I work best in silence and um so you know I think you should experiment for yourself like so when I'm writing some kinds of stuff I like music or I like silence when I'm doing other kinds of work like if I'm building a to-do list I like to do it in silence I listen to something upbeat if I'm feeling low and especially if I'm going to do something like stream or teach so when I put on like a stage presence and when I sort of need to be in the zone I'll like listen to some kind of upbeat music I have like a playlist of like stuff like Das Malifetz and uh it sort of depends so I think kind of figure out what works for you Question for Dr. K. Yeah now the disclaimer is over y'all can y'all can just head out um hi Dr. K my name is Sabina hello Sabina I live in Europe so I watch your streams after they are done airing because sleep good for you but I had a question about how to keep the relationship flame going okay I moved to Germany for my girlfriend and we are together now for six months and it's now for six months and it's just perfect respect trust time to ourselves going on dates being able to chill together at the moment I feel like I have the perfect relationship we want to move in together after she is done with school this summer do you have any tips on how to keep a relationship really good after moving in or generally after being together for long I watch all of your streams so if you include the question I would be very grateful thanks for helping me procrastinate less by the way really helped okay so first thing is I don't know if this question applies to many other people who are watching right so like how do you keep a relationship good or keep it going is probably going to be confusing for most of the people who are watching so um and uh yeah sorry I can't help myself so you guys know I love you all right and I actually do respect you and I know many of you guys are in relationships but let's be clear like I'm envisioning so just so you guys know in my mind when I picture my viewer I picture myself at the age of 19 like that's who I'm talking to and at that point if you guys want to hear a super cringe story I'll tell you guys the most cringe thing that I've ever done in terms of asking a girl out or actually not even asking a girl out I'll tell you guys on Valentine's Day so remind me to tell the story most mortifying thing I still get emotional about it when I think about it um so let's answer this question though so okay so how do you keep things good in a relationship so the first thing to understand is that you know I'd be really curious how old this person is um but the thing to remember is that like relationships are going to change over time and people are going to change over time so if you're trying to preserve what you have now that's not going to work the first thing to understand right so people are going to change people are going to grow so it sounds like you're dating a student right now and that person soon may not be a student so their life is going to change their pressures are going to change their stress is going to change they're going to be exposed to different people so I think the best way to keep a healthy relationship is to understand what's happening in your relationship and also not try to hold on to it so don't try to hold on to a particular thing because understand that people are going to change over time and that your relationship is going to change over time and that you have to like kind of roll with the punches so as as your as demands on each of y'all change as you guys grow as people like be really proactive about it because I think what the the reason that relationships fail over time is because people are growing and changing without actually talking about it or realizing it and then like five years down the road you're like in this situation where you've been engaged for three years and neither of y'all is really sure if you want to get married but you have so much momentum you just kind of stay in the relationship you stay in the relationship out of momentum instead of like growing together and then over time you start to resent each other because you're not the person that they used to be they're not I mean you're not the person that used to be they're not the person they used to be and that's okay it's just the more you guys are aware of how you guys change and like if you share that with your partner they can kind of you guys can like work through it you don't end up into the situation where you're like 40 married with a couple of kids and one of you wakes up one day and is like I want an open relationship because I want to sleep with other people like that's just if you get to that point without all of the discussion that's happened then just understand that like you're kind of like it's going to be really tough at that point right so most people wait until relationships are on the verge of like having real problems before trying to go to marriage counseling or things like that which sort of makes sense but I think you should be really proactive about understanding how your um how your relationship is evolving and as long as you continue to have conversations like every six months or every year about okay where are you going where am I going where are we going what's working for us what isn't do I need to make certain sacrifices for you do you need to make certain sacrifices for me so like I had those thankfully had those conversations with my wife sort of automatically because after I finished college she was still in Austin and I had the opportunity to like move to Boston to do research and so we kind of talked about what that meant for us and like whether she was going to come or whether we were going to try long distance and then she eventually moved to New York because her her company got acquired and then we were kind of like long distance in Boston New York and then like that was another conversation like when are you going to move when are you not going to move like do we want to be together how long do we want to do this and then she was basically like I'll move if you put a ring on it and I was like okay so then it was kind of up to me and so I put a ring on it and then she moved and we're at not really that happily ever after part but we're pretty happy right now so okay um um okay so I think it's reasonable right so if you have demands and things that you want in a relationship you should share them with someone demands doesn't sound right but um okay so so how do I know if I should seek therapy for a specific problem I just turned 24 and I haven't had a girlfriend I've been with girls but I just can't seem to be able to build a relationship what do you think right I got this okay so should I really critically think and then answer just spit out what just spit out dude um okay so the nice thing about therapy is you you'll have all these thoughts going through your head back and forth of like uh am I doing the right thing here am I doing the right thing here uh well maybe this is bad maybe that's bad but then you'll just say all your thoughts and then the therapist will kind of lead you in a healthy direction maybe give you a few options still but this is the healthier ones so you could cut out the ones that aren't healthy so it's like you're playing who wants to be a millionaire there's a bcd I just thought of this analogy and then you do the 50 50 thing the therapist gives you the 50 50 thing instead of you picking for four options and then it makes your whole life seem a lot simpler so it sounds like you think this person should go to therapy for this yeah yeah I agree so first of all beautiful analogy there um and uh I mean I so I think that people need to understand that you don't have to have like a particular problem to go to therapy because part of what therapy is about is like Reckful said helping you narrow down like what the issues are right so if you're 24 and you don't have a girlfriend is it because you just have had bad luck or because you don't leave the house or because you're like so it sounds like you've been with girls and so you date but you may have some other kinds of psychological issues kind of going on that prevent you from getting into a relationship and also like it could just be that you just haven't met someone that you think is worth having a relationship with right so I think going to therapy is like a great idea if you're if there's some if there's some place in your life where you feel stuck and you're not quite sure why or how to move forward I think therapy is a great option so I mean I I understand what you all mean so I think the question is would it have been more productive if he was not on psilocybin so first of all we don't know what he was on or what he wasn't on right so let's just be clear about that that we perceive something and we can have a hypothesis and we can have a pretty good a high likelihood of um I don't know how to do that okay anyway I don't know how to do that but so so we can have a hypothesis but then the other thing that I want to share with you guys is like so be patient right with yourselves and and with him and that we take we take people like the way that they are on stream and that can mean happy that can mean sad that can mean whatever I mean unless it becomes like a really problematic but I I think the other thing that was so here's so you could say like I could have gotten upset right I could have said oh like like he's fucking high like it's this is a waste of time he keeps on getting distracted that's really easy to do and there's a good reason you could do that you could sort of say like hey if you're not going to take this seriously like whatever you could do all of that stuff but I don't think that's what we're here for right we're here because sometimes people show up and they're not on their a game and when they're not on their a game or he may think he's on his a game I don't know so you guys decide what what's a game and what isn't but like that's how you are like sometimes you're not on your a game and like you should cut yourself some slack and like don't give up on yourself or don't give up on someone else for not showing their a game you take people where they are you meet people where they are that's where you start you don't expect them to be what they are not right that's not like help is not conditional based upon someone being where you want them to be or someone being where they should be like you meet people where they are that's the only way that change happens so do I think it's productive absolutely so I think like we learned an important lesson today right which now I'm going to sound arrogant but I hope you guys everyone who's judging him for being the way that he was that you can be productive if you stick with it that you should not give up because I think that everyone would have been fine if I said if I cut off the interview after 15 minutes I said hey this is just not working like everyone would have been fine with that right so like put like be patient it's not about perseverance it's not necessarily about never giving up because I think you know at some point things are are futile but be patient be patient with people be patient with yourselves most of all and like understand because what do you guys do like when you don't show up with your a game for yourself in your own life how do you treat yourself you treat yourself terribly you give up on yourself so easily you beat the crap out of yourself you're lazy you're stupid you're undisciplined not stupid because you guys think you're smart right you're lazy so don't do that don't give up on yourself it can be productive be patient give yourself a chance and despite any amount of like stuff that's floating around in your brain like you can actually find a productive something at the end of it if you just stick it through so I mean I think another version of this question is that like do I think the session would have been different or arguably more productive absolutely right so if someone's not distracted but like dealing with distraction is like actually really important so on the other hand like just the fact that you can I mean despite everything that was stacked against us in terms of emotions ADHD a doo-doo and fucking construction he can get there and you can too that I think is a very important lesson right that's the final boss when the final boss shows up you don't just like say oh fuck fuck this I'm done when the final boss shows up you fucking you level up and you rise to the challenge and whether it be construction or psilocybin or emotions or trauma whatever the fuck it is you do what you showed up to do that's what you got to do so don't fucking give up okay so how do you grow up from being emotionally neglected for a long time um so I think you it takes time so the first thing is yeah so someone saying I'm a give-upper yeah like that so that's fucking twitch's problem right is that like half y'all are giver uppers and when I say half of y'all what I'm thinking of once again is my 19 year old self I was definitely a give-upper like I was a giver-upper and be patient with yourself because it took me eight years from being on academic probation to starting med school like eight years eight years is a long ass time like long long long time and starting med school by the way was 10 years ago so starting med school is eight years after being a giver-upper and then it takes another decade to get to where I am today 18 years of my life have been spent on this journey so don't judge yourself for fucking around for two or three like two or three is nothing man give yourself time stick it through to the end so how do you grow up from being emotionally neglected for a long time so I think it happens slowly okay and um I think that unfortunately like you can't fix all of the emotional neglect yourself I think what you can fix is like if you have so emotional neglect is going to result in certain patterns that affect your current relationships the real solution is to not be emotionally neglected right to engage in relationships there's no substitute for love so if you weren't like appropriately loved when you were growing up like you can't just be a pillar by yourself like human beings need love so you have to engage in a relationship where you like a healthy relationship it doesn't have to be romantic but it can be like with a mentor or a friend or or even like you can adopt or have a kid or whatever like you can there are all kinds of healthy relationships through which you can undo emotional neglect the real challenge is that as a result of that emotional neglect you are going to exhibit certain behaviors and have certain cognitive biases that are going to make it hard for you to successfully engage in a healthy relationship so your job is to understand yourself go to therapy learn to meditate do some yoga do all of the above and notice those patterns notice the way that you self-sabotage because when you're emotionally neglected you're going to sabotage relationships not all the time but like that's what happens for a lot of people and then that's really the problem so once you stop the self-sabotage then the relationships will naturally grow because generally speaking i don't care what you think about yourself like most human beings are actually pretty cool like i don't know if you all realize this but like most people are actually pretty cool and like all you have to do is like hang out with someone to sort of realize that most people pretty cool and so if you just give yourself some time and some space like it'll work out well so really work on those behaviors and how your emotions influence the things that you do okay so i hate to hurt people how do you break up with someone you genuinely care for and you're the reason they get hurt i hate to hurt people i love how do you break up with someone you genuinely care for and you're the reason they get hurt okay um that's an interesting question so i mean so i i think your compass should not as bizarre as this sounds whether you do something or don't do something should not necessarily be dictated by another person's feelings that's my personal opinion and i think that's the most important thing to do because i think that's the most important thing to do because i think that's the most important thing to do because should not necessarily be dictated by another person's feelings that's my short answer right so if i don't like my job but i respect my boss and he was loyal to me and if i left that would hurt his feelings it doesn't mean that i should stay in his job right so like i this is going to sound really dangerous so i don't want you guys i want you guys to really listen carefully to what i'm saying so i mean hurt feelings are a part of life does that mean that you should go around and be an asshole no but that also means that like it's not your responsibility really at the end of the day like you can't control the way that someone else feels if the relationship is not working for you i think it's reasonable to end the relationship and do it as compassionately as possible and do your dharma in the relationship right so like don't just like be an asshole to them and leave them hanging but let them know but i think honestly i mean if you're in a relationship with someone i think part of your dharma is to like give that person the opportunity to be in a relationship with someone who wants to be in a relationship with them and if that involves a little bit of pain along the way i think that's fine i think it's a far bigger sin to stay in a relationship that you don't want to and have them be in a relationship with someone who doesn't want to be with them like that's going to breed way more subtle resentment passive aggressive stuff and all kinds of crap that's like incredibly toxic and under the surface so i think that you just gotta you know i understand that you hate to hurt people that you love but i think sometimes you have to do things that they may find hurtful this is the other thing is that a lot of people live their life based on the imagined emotions of other people just think about this for a second right you don't know what they're actually going to experience but the reason that you stay in the relationship is because when you imagine their reaction you imagine that hurt and you're actually living your your life based on your imagination of someone else's reaction like what the actual fuck is that that is no way to live life you are controlled by hypothetical emotions in future human beings so what's up with that right so this is something that i work on a fair amount this is part of our curriculum by the way that i'm developing because this is a common thing right so this is a quote from like a lecture or like class or something i'm putting out a series of lectures that a lot of people live based on the imagined emotions of others so what's up with that right so this is imagined emotions of others and that's actually how you live your life on the imagine you live your life based on hypotheticals so don't do that right we'll explore like how that what that's about and i can talk more about that but you know also understand that like people can be disappointed and be hurt and also be happy for you because people are multi-dimensional like if you tell someone hey i just don't think this is the right relationship i love you a lot but i just don't see us together like long term and i'm sorry like i've been trying to not be in this i've been trying to not do this because i care about you so much and i don't want to hurt you but at the same time like i just don't think it's fair to you for me to actually stay in this relationship out of loyalty and i think we should end things and then you listen to what they say and if they have like really good arguments for you to stay or they want to give it another shot and they want to give it three months and see where it goes like you can have that conversation my point is that like that conversation needs to be had right so you break up with someone and you you be honest with them because they deserve your honesty they don't deserve your like obfuscation and you hiding your feelings and and if you have some if there's some reason that the relationship isn't working out like that's the way you repair it you start with a conversation you want to break up with them for a particular reason right but you that's got to come out into the open because if you have a grievance you have to give them a chance to solve it that's otherwise a relationship that's not going to work out and you're going to have to that's otherwise a relationship that's not going to work okay how do you deal with self doubt sometimes i can feel i can do everything and someday soon i feel i can't because i have a fear of failure how do i deal with this okay so how do you deal with self-doubt sometimes sometimes i feel i can do everything and someday soon i feel i can't because i have a fear of failure how do i deal with this okay so there's like a short answer and there's a long end so the first is that you actually fail is that you just fail, right? Because if you fail and if you survive and you get used to failure, it's kind of like wreckful, right? He's actually okay with rejection. He gets okay handling rejection. He's gotten good at it. Just fail and survive. And then like you fail a couple times and you fail a couple more times and you fail a couple more times. So I had something like 140 rejections from med school before I got accepted. The first five hurt a lot. The next 20 hurt a lot. The next 10 not so much. And then the next year, the first five, so like 40 through 45 hurt a lot. And then they hurt a lot and they hurt a lot and they hurt a lot. And then he'd get used to it and then you just keep going. So oddly, I think the solution to fear of failure, it's like how do you overcome a fear of heights or a fear of dogs? It's like exposure therapy, right? Like you go and you hang out with a dog. You manage your fear. You see that you're alive. You go to the Empire State Building and you look down and you feel like, oh my God, that's so scary. And then you look out of your airplane window and things like that. You do things in a safe manner, but you expose yourself to your fear and you begin to realize that actually, just like wreckful, the fear of rejection is more dangerous than rejection itself. And that generally is true. Like fear of things is actually worse oftentimes than the thing itself. Obvious caveats, like that's not blanketly true. Like I think, I mean, I'd rather be afraid of cancer than get cancer, right? So like, it's not like blanketly true. But generally speaking, fear of a thing is worse for us than the thing itself. Fear is absolutely the mind killer, right? Frank Herbert. So the longer thing, there's more to this question though, because I want to point something out to you guys. Fear of failure and failing is like one solution, although that's a potential challenge, right? Because you don't want to just run around failing everything. Like that's not good. But I want to point something else to you guys. How can I, can I copy this? Okay. I'm gonna just switch this. This is gonna be our last question by the way. Okay. So, what I want to do is just, I want to point something out to you guys. Okay. Very important, not discord. Streamlabs, not Streamlabs. Here we go. How, oh. How do you deal with self doubt sometime? We're gonna just add some grammar, okay? And punctuation. I feel I can do everything and someday soon, I feel I can't because I have a fear of failure. How do I deal with this? Okay. So let's start with this. So the first thing is, what is this? What's that? What do you guys think? What does that mean? Yeah, colors, right? It's gray, right? So people are saying fear, right? So this in and of itself is not necessarily true. So we can see that this person has a complex in their mind, a sum scar, right? A cognitive bias that failure is inevitable. And they have this pattern where they feel like they're doing everything right and it's all gonna come crashing down. Very common pattern. Do you guys see that? It's like success, success, success and failure. They feel like the failure is inevitable. So this pattern needs to be dealt with because this isn't necessarily true. Like you can just, like this sentence right here actually speaks to a lot of like cognitive bias about how this person deals with the world. This is their self doubt. The next thing is that this problem is not gonna be fixed until this portion goes away. So the pathology here is not that failure is inevitable, but that they actually like, they don't stay stable. They like, they have high highs and they have low lows. So you feel like you're on top of the world and you're amazing and everything is great. And then everything crashes. And that's because like this feeling is gonna end because that's not how real life is, right? You can't feel like you're gonna do everything. Like that feeling is gonna end like that feeling is gonna come with like the other side of the coin which is like the feeling of failure. So interestingly enough, what this person needs to do is be a little bit more even. And what they try to do is they deal with the self doubt, right? But if you guys want some real five head shit, what the question should be is how do I deal with with unrealistic overconfidence? Do you guys see that? You can't have one without the other. So in a subtle, subtle, but important way, this is the big problem because I think this is why they failed because they haven't correctly diagnosed the problem because they keep on focusing on fear and self doubt. They don't actually realize that like this is a problem and this is a problem because if you have unrealistic overconfidence, your hopes are gonna be dashed, right? So you have to see that. And so what this person needs to do is not meditate when they're feeling doubtful, right? So the other thing about wreckful is it's not just meditating through bad emotions. I want you guys to understand this. Does anyone understand why? So I don't know if you all caught this, but like when he asked me to say cockpog, why did I say it? Does anyone understand this? Okay, so I think, so you guys, for those of you who think that I'm trying to distract them from the negative emotions, that is partially right, okay? The other reason that I said it is that I wanted to teach him to breathe through the highs and the lows, right, it's just not meditation to remove yourself from the negative, it's meditation to remove yourself from the positive too. It's finding equilibrium in face of the highs and in space of the lows, because wreckful too suffers this thing where he gets super excited and then super let down. So detachment or vairagya, which is the Sanskrit word, is about being detached from the good and detached from the bad. And so I trained myself for the moment where there's this thing called match day, where you figure out where you're gonna do your residency training. And I went there and I sort of knew, I knew I had a pretty good shot of getting into Mass General Hospital and HM at Harvard Medical School. And I trained myself for that moment and I meditated and I said, whatever this piece of paper says, I'm not gonna feel elatement and I'm not gonna feel disappointment, both of them are off the table. I do not want either one. The paper says what it is going to say and that will determine my future, so be it. I'm gonna do the best that I can no matter what the piece of paper says. And then you open the piece of paper and then I saw Mass General Hospital, Oakland Hospital, Harvard Medical School. I smiled, yay. My wife was overjoyed, everyone else was overjoyed. I was like, great, so be it, so be it. Tranquility and equilibrium through the positive and the negative. Because if you get disrupted on the top end, you're gonna face the low end. Tranquility is not just about avoidance of negative emotions, it's about avoidance, it's not avoidance of negative or positive, it's tranquility in the face of both. So you should meditate when you're happy and you should meditate when you're sad. You should meditate during all of these different times and be able to find that place within yourself. It is not just an avoidance of pain. Right, does that make sense? So it is being with yourself and this is how you really develop confidence. Because if you can be tranquil within yourself and not be buffeted by the winds of success, then you also will not be buffeted by the winds of failure. The problem is that everyone tries to use meditation as a treatment to avoid negative emotion and they're missing the point. It is a treatment to avoid attachment to all emotion, to be able to live life in a tranquil state and enjoy what comes at you, no matter what comes, to be able to face it no matter what comes. Whether the person that you're trying to talk to is high on psilocybin or not high on psilocybin, you are there for a reason and you do the work that you need to do. Whether they break down in 15 minutes and inflate your ego because that's what everyone wants to see or they don't break down in 15 minutes, you are there to do what you wanna do. So be tranquil within yourself. Meditate in face of the good and the bad and don't just chase success and don't try to avoid failure. Both of those things are equally bad. Do the best that you can, do what you showed up to do and like just, that's the goal. And success will come. Should you strive to accomplish? Absolutely, but don't get caught up in it.
