 So healthy gamer, what's a healthy use of games or tech? It's a great question. So when we think about addiction, what we think of as addiction is something that impairs your function. It impacts your academic life, your professional life, your physical health, your relationships, your mental health. So what I consider healthy technology use is technology use that doesn't hurt you. It's the ability to actually enjoy the technology that you use. And what we sort of see is that the first half hour or hour that you play a video game, it's actually fun. But by hour two, by hour three, by hour four, the enjoyment goes down. And that's when we fall into an addiction. We're using the thing, but we're not even having fun. So what we try to encourage is for people to understand, okay, how much enjoyment are you having from the technology? Do you wanna take a couple of pictures? Absolutely. But what you wanna remember is how much you enjoyed looking at that work of art, how much you enjoyed being there, how much you enjoyed being with those people. It's to evoke a memory, not to replace it.
