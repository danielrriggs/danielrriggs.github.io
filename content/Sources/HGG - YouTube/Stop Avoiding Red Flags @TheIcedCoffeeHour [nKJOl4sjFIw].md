 So this is the other thing I've seen every successful relationship or almost every successful relationship I've seen as a psychiatrist. And a lot of people may think, okay, like if you're a psychiatrist, don't you see bad relations? No, like most people actually have healthy relationships. Everyone comes for couples counseling. Every relationship I've seen that successful has at least one red flag. And even that everyone's like red flag run for the hills. Don't run for the hills, because when you have a red flag early in the relationship, you learn conflict resolution. Can you manage conflict with this person? Right. So I had red flags early in my relationship. My wife had red flags and we worked through those. And wow, it turns out that if you can resolve your red flags, that's actually like a very good prognostic sign for future relationships. But we run away from them.
