 You know that there are times in your life where you actually do a really good job, and then you ask yourself, why can't I be like this every day? Right? There's one day that you're super focused, you get everything done on time. You wake up in the morning, you study for three hours, you do all your work for the day, and then you're free for the rest of the day. It feels so liberating, feels so good. And then the next day you stumble, you get distracted. And then you ask yourself, okay, how do I stop this distraction? How do I fix that problem? And what positive deviance essentially does, it doesn't focus on the problems, it focuses on the solutions. So what positive deviance is all about is take that one day that you did do a good job, and ask yourself, what are the factors that lead to this success? Instead of focusing on all the stuff that knocks you off your game, try to duplicate that which puts you on your game. And so as you look at the success that you have, let's say you exercised one morning, look at when did you go to bed the night before? What did you eat the day before? What was on your mind? Were you stressed out? Did you play video games? And look at all of the factors that led to that success.
