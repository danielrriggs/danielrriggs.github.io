 The second thing about video games that is really interesting is that if you look at our sense of identity, video games let us create our own sense of identity. And this is something that we've seen. I've worked with people who are, let's say, high school students who are maybe 15 years old. Maybe they're a little bit overweight. They're going through puberty. Their voice is starting to change. They have acne and they feel really embarrassed about who they are in real life. But in the video game, they get to be whoever they want to be. They don't get judged on how much they weigh or how they look. They get to invent an identity. And so what we've discovered is that gaming allows us to invent an identity that we can be really proud of. And that becomes a problem because at some point we become more proud of the person that we are online as opposed to the person that we are in real life. And then we start to retreat more and more into the video game and we sort of lose sight of who we are in real life. And then we get really stuck because I fall further and further behind in the real world, but I keep advancing in the virtual world.
