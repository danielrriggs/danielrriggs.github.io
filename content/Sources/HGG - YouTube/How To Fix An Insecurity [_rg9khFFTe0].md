 If you have an insecurity that you don't know how to fix, that's actually okay, you can still make progress. And the way to make progress is to change your relationship with the insecurity. So if I have an insecurity, what does that mean for my life? If you're not careful, your insecurity will shape your actions, will start to control your life and like build your destiny. But it is your relationship with the insecurity that actually determines it. Because I'm insecure about all kinds of crap, but I don't have to let that insecurity dictate my actions. So change the power dynamic between you and your insecurity. You will say, well, I'm insecure, therefore I cannot... No, you can, it's just really hard. And it's the belief that you can't act because of this insecurity that in and of itself is what determines your destiny.
