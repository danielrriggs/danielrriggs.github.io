 What advice do you give to people about going down the path of AI girlfriends? Avoid it like the plague, don't even touch it, never look at it, or no it's fine, it's like porn, as long as you're not addicted you're good. With all technology, it's just recognize that if you have a life that is worth living, the addiction will melt away on its own. So I had a video game addiction, we're a healthy gamer now, I teach my kids how to play video games, I play games with them. The whole point is that with these AI girlfriends, you're going to be vulnerable to that if you have no other substantial relationships. So I think the advice that I give to everyone is build a life that is worth living. Oddly enough, I don't even focus so much on the addiction because we have to have a solid foundation from which to combat addiction. So I think the biggest mistake that many people make with trying to overcome an addiction is that they are not acknowledging the factors in their life that are driving them towards the addiction in the first place. And you have to tackle those things and then you can deal with the addiction way easier.
