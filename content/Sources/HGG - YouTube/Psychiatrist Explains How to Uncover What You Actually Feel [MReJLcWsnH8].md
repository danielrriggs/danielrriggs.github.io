 I'm frustrated by not being invited to parties. I'm frustrated that my friends always forget to invite me. But if you really dig underneath that, that's an umbrella emotion. What I really feel is like lonely. What I really feel is devalued, right? So there's a lot of stuff kind of under there. So start small, start wherever you are, and start to kind of dig in a little bit slowly.
