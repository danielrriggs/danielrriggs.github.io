 A lot of Asian Americans and families care a lot about saving face. If you're struggling, first of all, you've got to fix it yourself. And secondly, you better not ask anybody else for help, because what if people find out, oh my God, you're depressed, like you better not see a therapist? What if someone finds out that you see a therapist? You know, what if you tell someone, no, my God, that would be so embarrassing, because if you were seeing a therapist or if you were getting help for problems, that would reflect poorly on us as parents. That means that we're not raising you right. This other kid down the street or that boy down the street, he's not in therapy and he's getting A's, and his parents smack him more than I smack you. Like, what is your problem? We can't let anybody know. And so since there's this emphasis on saving face, it means that you can't go to other people for help, because that's incredibly embarrassing and makes us look bad. Look what the hell is wrong with you. Not only are you screwing up, now you're going to make us look bad. That's a terrible idea.
