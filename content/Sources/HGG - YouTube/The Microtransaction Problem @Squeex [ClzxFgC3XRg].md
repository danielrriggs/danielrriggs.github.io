 The biggest mistake that people make is that if there's a game that has a ton of microtransactions and you free to play it, you are still supporting their model. So a lot of people think that they're like, okay, I'm going to just free to play it or I won't buy cosmetics. But if you even purchase the game and free to play it, like that's good enough. There's something really interesting about microtransaction psychology, which is that if they're a bunch of free to play people, the whales are going to spend more because now there's all the plebs. And even if you're free to playing a game, you're horribly supporting the microtransaction model because you're being one of the plebs that fuels the ego of the whale. And so a lot of these companies, they very well know that the majority of people will be like free to play. But we need those people in there to make the other people feel good about themselves. Just to flex, to have like the whales flex like, look at this. It's not just about buying the stuff. It's about separating out the people who have it versus the people who don't.
