 The reason that video games and gambling, the reason they're so addictive is actually the denial of a reward. I feel that because you're just like you said, like I actually can stop on a win, but I cannot stop on a loss. That is where the compulsion is. One more. My eyes will be watering and it's just I cannot walk away with that. Absolutely, because I think we sort of know that if you look at the human brain and what the brain likes, so we as a society value things that are difficult. Now, this is kind of at the cultural level and at the neuroscience level. So if you even think about something as simple as a child that's learning how to walk or even pick up an object, a child who's trying to pick up a ball will fail thousands of times. And yet there's something in our brain that impels them to keep trying. So anytime we have difficulty and we're denied a reward and then we get the reward, that's what actually releases like a very high amount of dopamine. Yes.
