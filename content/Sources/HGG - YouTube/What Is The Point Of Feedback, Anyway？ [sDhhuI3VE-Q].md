 The purpose of feedback is to get people to improve, right? It's to give them opportunities generally to improve. What's the purpose of telling someone something that they're doing wrong? What does that accomplish? It doesn't accomplish anything unless you can also tell them how to fix it. So the reason that we give negative feedback is to actually help people improve. Otherwise, it does no good. So what we want feedback to be, let's run through what good feedback looks like. So first of all, it should be constructive or actionable. So it's not an attribute of yourself or personhood. It's like an action that you can take. The second thing that is ideal around feedback is that feedback should be sort of measurable or trackable in some way. So if I tell you that I want you to be better at X, Y, Z, I should also let someone know, how are we going to measure that? When are we going to measure that? How are we going to track progress? What does progress look like? This is where, once again, if you tell someone you're not enough of a team player, well, what do I do tomorrow morning? How do I be more of a team player? So we want feedback to be constructive, actionable, and measurable.
