 If you are a man and you say, I am suffering today, what is the response that you're going to get? Shut up. Absolutely. Not in those exact words, but that's whatever the words are. That's what they mean. I want us to be very, very careful, right? So if you are listening to Stephen, say people tell you to shut up and your first thought as a listener is, no, that's not true. That's the problem. If people agree with you, they understand what you're saying. But if they disagree with you, that's the problem. We literally have a man who is telling us right now that your experience is when I say I'm suffering, people tell you to shut up. And then people are going to be judging you for saying that. And they're going to be saying, no, that's not true. They're going to be saying shut up. Absolutely. Right? So this is exactly the problem.
