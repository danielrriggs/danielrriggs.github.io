 The way that all of us are sitting right now is wrong. The way that we're sitting, like, is not how we're supposed to sit. How we're supposed to sit. If you guys want to sit up straight, there's one really easy principle. All right. Your knees should be lower than your hips. Oh, what the hell? I don't think the couch lets me do that. I'm too big. Exactly. So the reason that you hate sitting up straight is because no furniture is designed for you to sit up straight. So I'll teach you all something cool. I'm a freak. So I'm going to sit like this. So this is easy for me to sit up straight. You guys may not be able to do that. No problem. If you sit on the cushion. Oh, on the cushion? But put your, yeah, like that. I got it. So half and half is right. And notice what happens to your back. Does it feel weird anymore? It doesn't feel weird or it does? It doesn't feel weird anymore. So isn't that weird that sitting up straight no longer feels weird? There's a really simple test that you can also do, where if you sit at the edge of your chair and you put your feet out in front of you and you cross your legs, your back will naturally be straight. So edge of the chair, feet are nice. So scoot back just a little bit. And you notice the difference now? Yeah, yeah. Definitely. I can feel it in my lower back.
