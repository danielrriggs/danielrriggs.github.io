 How do we stop waking up tilted? The first thing that you can do is literally sleep more. So of the people that I've worked with who wake up tilted very, very chronically, they usually sleep for about seven hours a night. So you gotta sleep more. Don't use pot, don't use marijuana, don't use alcohol, or even sleeping medication to help you sleep. What you wanna do is blackout curtains, weighted blanket. These are the two things that you wanna do. Lower the thermostat, make it cold, and snuggle into that blanket. You wanna force yourself into a physiologic hibernation. First thing you need to do is just sleep more. There's a lot of evidence that shows that waking up tilted actually correlates with sleeping insufficiently.
