 Why is there things about myself that I don't like and they're fucked up, but I cannot change them? Like for example, I think my humor is really fucked up. There's this video of Gordon Ramsay online telling people to kill themselves, and I think it's so funny. And I don't know why I think it's so funny. Let's start by understanding, okay, how does a human being change? Wanting to change. Acceptance. So wanting to change. So there are a lot of people out there that I'm sure want to exercise more. Acceptance of what? Sounds like something you learn on a podcast. So what do you need to accept? I think weird shit is funny. What's wrong with that? It off-puts other people when I laugh at Gordon Ramsay. Okay. What I'm hearing is that you should change. If you even think about the word, should, by definition, if you should do something, that means you're not doing it. Right. Shoulds are all the things that you don't do. So what I'm hearing from you is that you don't actually have a good reason to change. Yeah, that's true. So if you don't have a good reason to change, then you're not going to change, right? Yeah.
