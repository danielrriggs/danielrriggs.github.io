 We're not taught how to ask for help, right? Like how do you ask for help? You can point out what your deficiency is. You can point out that you are striving for something and then you can ask for help, right? So this is the stuff that I literally teach my patients. Hey, I noticed that I'm not very good at making friends. I would love to be like a better human being and a member of a community and contribute to like the people around me. Can you please help me strengthen my relationships? That's the thing. Point out a flaw that you have, pick a goal that you wanna strive towards and then ask for help. Hey, I noticed a deficiency. This is where I wanna go. Can you help me? One, two, three. This is the best way to ask for help.
