 Sometimes the reason that we're rebellious when we're told not to do something is because we discovered early on that the things that are forbidden for us are actually really fantastic. Like sometimes that's what it is. So imagine that I grow up in a household where I wasn't like allowed to drink, let's say, Coke, right? All the other kids get to have Coke and all the other kids get to play video games. I don't get to play video games. I don't get to have Coke. I don't get to have Sprite. I don't get to have any soda. Pepsi, nothing. And so like when I go to my friend's house and I have a soda and I get to play video games, I'm like, wow, this is really amazing. I love this stuff. So some of us then learn what's the lesson that that child learns. The child learns that, oh, the stuff that is restricted to me is like actually fantastic. And so once you learn that if you've been raised in a very restrictive household, then you're going to have some programming or conditioning to run into the direction of what you've been warned away against.
