 So another problem that's happening with dating is that like dating is not turning into hassle-free. In fact, it's becoming the opposite. So I'm selecting for my mate. And in order to get this, y'all need to pass my tests. So dating apps are increasingly becoming about filtering and like interviewing. They're not, it's not dating anymore. It's not like, let's see where this goes. It's like, do you match my criteria? Which by the way is created by the dating apps because they create criteria. They ask you, what's your criteria? If you look at the history of humanity and the whole animal kingdom and mammals and all kinds of things, no one has criteria. It's like, Hey, like I'm gonna do this dance for you. You into it or you not into it, right? All that stuff is gone from modern dating, which is why it's so hard because all these criteria and finding the perfect mate and planning for your life together from day one, like, I don't know how to say this, but an early relationship cannot withstand the pressures of a long-term relationship at the first date. You can't do that. That's why it crumbles.
