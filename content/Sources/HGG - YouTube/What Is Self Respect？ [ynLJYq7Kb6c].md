 So what is self-respect? How do you get it? So right now you're willing to sacrifice yourself to get happiness from outside of you. And without that happiness from outside of you, you're gonna feel alone, you're gonna feel hungry, because you don't have all of those things. So self-respect is actually choosing pain. At the end of the day, self-respect is about who controls your happiness in life. And when you surrender that control to another human being, even if you're addicted to it, I can understand. When you're addicted to the happiness that she provides and you let her dictate the terms of the relationship, what you're doing is you're putting your happiness in her hands. So whether you're happy or unhappy is dependent on her. So you're surrendering that control and that's when other people, when one human sees another human being surrender their self-control, that's when they tell them to have some self-respect. So how do you get your self-respect? You take that control back. Why is it hard to take that control back? Because oftentimes taking that control back comes with pain.
