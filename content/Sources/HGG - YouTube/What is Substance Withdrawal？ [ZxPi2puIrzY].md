 If we think about caffeine, for example, the first time you have caffeine, it'll completely wire you. But if you have caffeine every day, your body develops tolerance to it, and then you kind of become dependent on it. That means that in the absence of caffeine, you will experience withdrawal, because your body is used to that substance floating around, and when it's no longer there, your body kind of like craves that substance. So in some cases, this physiologic dependence can be like very profound and very damaging. So in the case of alcohol use dependence or benzodiazepine, which are these drugs like lorazepam or Valium, Xanax, things like that, this tolerance that we can develop can be so profound that in the absence of the substance, it can actually induce seizures. So what tends to happen is that once we use a lot of substance, like we're getting a high signal, so what our brain kind of does is turns down the volume on that signal. And then in the absence of that, there's sort of like a withdrawal experience that you have.
