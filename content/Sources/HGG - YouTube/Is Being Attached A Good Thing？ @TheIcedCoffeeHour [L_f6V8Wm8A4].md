 Is attachment ever good? Is it ever healthy to be attached to something? It depends on what your goal is. If the goal is happiness, the answer is no. If the goal is worldly success, the answer can be yes. You know, when I decided to have kids, I was really struggling because I was like, oh my God, do I want to be detached from my kids? I had kids and then I realized the moment that I start loving my kids is the moment that I like open myself to a world of hurt. Because if things go bad, then I'm unhappy. And if things go good, then I'm happy. And so then what I kind of did is detach from that attachment. And I sort of said, okay, in this life, I've chosen to have kids. This is what I've signed up for, which means that one day I could be heartbroken, one day I could be sad, one day I could be mad. When I decided to have children is when I opened myself up to a world of joy and a world of hurt. And so even in that, I have a lot of peace because this is what I signed up for, right? It could go well, it could go bad. The key thing is deciding to roll the dice with your eyes wide open. Okay, I'm gonna do this. And this means that my life could be screwed or it could be happy and chances are it's gonna be all of the above.
