 The real antidote to FOMO, the real way to become immune to FOMO, is to feel like there's nothing missing on the inside, the fear of missing out. And when we are unfulfilled internally, that makes our minds very, very vulnerable to FOMO, because we've got these two really critical circuits, these primitive circuits in the brain of wanting what other people want and fear of ostracization. And FOMO tackles both of those. And the real challenge is that our cortical structures of the brain, our logic and all this other kind of stuff doesn't really work at kind of fixing those problems. So I encourage y'all to really lean towards your values. Start to take a couple of small steps, and you don't have to go all the way. And as you do that, you'll start to build contentment and you will start to induce FOMO in others.
