 Here's why anti-work is a thing. What happened is companies figured out how to be predatory on people's dissatisfaction. This is why working conditions have gotten so bad. Companies figured out that a human being's self-worth is tied up with what I give them. And so now when I say you lose destiny over your life, when your emotions get tied into work, the loss of control, you lose control, who gains control over your life? The company does. So anytime you give up the reins, someone's taking them. So they figured this out. I don't even know that they know what they figured out. But they sort of figured out that, okay, there's some amount of dissatisfaction that we can breathe into people. And if you breathe into them dissatisfaction and I control their satisfaction, then I can get them to behave in the way that I want.
