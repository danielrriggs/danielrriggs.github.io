 You need to be closer to the listener. Because if you're the listener, you can do it. The person who doesn't do it is you with all your fucking psychological shit. So this is a sound meditation. So what I want you guys to do is listen. I'm going to ring the bell. Okay? And what I'm going to do is ask you guys to listen to the... Try to detect as subtle of an oscillation as you can. Okay? Close your eyes. Yes, sit up straight, close your eyes. We're going to begin. Just listen to the oscillation. And now I want you to ask yourself, who is doing the listening? Think about the person that you are. Think about your gender. And ask yourself, is a man, a woman, or something else listening? Continue to listen. Listen for the oscillation. And now think about the location that you occupy. And where are you when you listen to this? Do you even have a location? How would you know where your location is? As you listen, what do you feel? Where are you? Just focus on the listening. And now ask yourself, who is doing the listening? You may identify with a particular name, but as you listen, are you that person or are you just the listener? Continue to listen to the oscillations. Notice that your mind activates that you try to answer my questions that you think. And we'll ring the bell three more times. And now I want you to just listen to the sound of the self. Just hear whatever you hear within yourself and just listen. And now let yourself come back. Okay. So who was doing the listening? So when you say me, who is me? First of all, not every technique works for everyone. But this is what I want you to just stop and think about. That person who is listening is you, but that's not the person who lives your life. The person who lives your life is different. The person that lives your life has thoughts and fears and feels stuck and has anxiety and is a failure and can't launch and stuff like that. But the person who's listening is someone else. Like none of that stuff applies to them. So some of y'all get this, some of y'all don't, which is fine. And now think about that for a second. You have a person or a place within you that is free from all of that. And think about why your life is hard. Your life is hard because you don't, all of the problems that you have are present all the time. But those problems are like, they're sort of real, but they're also like not really real. So you could like, all that stuff is in the mind and you have a place within yourself that is like free from all that. Like just think about that. Like think about where you're stuck in life, like what you should do and ask yourself, what would the listener do? Like the listener can do stuff relatively easily because the listener actually doesn't really give a shit about much. Okay, so some of y'all get this, some of y'all don't. Like some of y'all don't. Like some of y'all don't. Like some of y'all don't. Like some of y'all don't. Like some of y'all don't. Okay, so some of y'all are going to get this and some of you don't and that's fine. So this is the important thing to remember for those of you guys who do get it, the listener would just do it, but you don't just do it, right? So if you want to start doing it in life, that's what she said, then you need to be closer to the listener. Because if you're the listener, you can do it. The person who doesn't do it is you with all your fucking psychological shit. The listener just does, just listens. It can just do. And so just like think for a second, okay? That if you can become the listener, then doing is easy. It's not hard. Doing is hard for you. It's not hard for the listener. So if you spend time, if you activate listener mode, you can do whatever the fuck you want. Listener doesn't give a shit. Listeners like, I'm just listening. Like I'm just here to do the thing that needs to be done. I'm not worried about the future. I'm not worried about the past. And you think about what paralyzes you. It's the future and the past, not the present. Future paralyzes you. Past paralyzes you, not the present. The listener doesn't know anything about the future or the past. Listener only knows about the present. It's all listener understands. If you try to even ask the listener what's going to happen in the future, the listener's like, I have no fucking, like there is no such thing as the future. There's just the sound. That's all I am. And that's all there is. So listen. Listen to the sound of your voice. Listen to the sound of your voice. Listen to the sound of your breath. And listen to the sound of waves. Are they the same? Are they different? Start listening. Okay. So I'm glad that this meditation worked for some of you guys. I'm struggling with trying to understand how on earth I can teach meditation over the internet. Because some things are hard to teach over the internet. Breath stuff is really easy. Sound stuff is like, I'm going to have to figure it out. I love sound. So maybe I'll study and I'll try to find out if there are more techniques that we can do over the internet. But thank you guys very much for coming. We're going to be streaming on Friday from 3 to 5. And, you know, if you guys have people that you want to come on, let them know. Let them know. Let us know. And try to make it happen.
