 Up to 60% of men who kill themselves have no evidence of mental illness. So I think one of the biggest tragedies that we're perpetrating right now, potentially, is that when we look at male suicide, we are assuming that this is a pathology of the mind. This person is sick. Instead of understanding that it's possible that half of the men who kill themselves, or more, don't kill themselves because they're ill. They kill themselves because they're genuinely in a position where death is the only way out. If we assume it's mental illness, we don't try to fix the problems that are pushing them towards suicide. Really, really scary thing that's going on. And I'm not saying that mental illness does not lead to suicide and people shouldn't get therapy and things like that. So when I have a patient who's in a traumatic and abusive relationship and they're suicidal, therapy may help them some with the suicide, but the most important thing I can do for that person's suicidality is to help them build a life where they're no longer abused. It's to change something in their life, not to change them.
