 The second big problem with green flags and people who are looking for the perfect person is that we're oftentimes looking for that person to fix something in our lives. We're looking for that person to be the antidote to a problem that we've got. So a simple example of this is like, you know, let's say finances, right? So I'm looking for a partner who can support me, which is totally fine. Like, I think it's totally fine for one partner to financially support another. But one of the biggest mistakes that I've seen in relationships, and if you want to know what leads to toxic relationships, it's when one person is deriving something out of the relationship that is beyond what the relationship should give. So I should get some amount of love and esteem from my relationship. But if I have core self-esteem problems and can't sit by myself or have really crippling loneliness, and I latch on to this person in a relationship to fix all of my loneliness problems or self-esteem problems, then that relationship is doomed.
