 And if you think about, you know, how do you make 400 grand? Like networking is a huge part of it. Self-awareness is a huge part of it. Knowing when to keep your mouth shut and when to talk, being able to regulate your emotions is a huge part of it. So I think that what you probably need to be successful is like some minimum level of IQ and it probably scales some as you get smarter and smarter and smarter, but what I've seen the most transformation and because IQ is relatively fixed is teaching people EQ skills. So as you teach people more about themselves and how they function as human beings, right? Cause like at the end of the day, it doesn't matter what you do. You're always using the instrument of yourself and we never get formal training about why can't I wake up in the morning? Why do I like coffee? Why do I get dependent on coffee? Why do I get dependent on pornography? Why do I feel the way that I do? Why do I feel uncomfortable presenting in front of my bosses? Like there's all kinds of stuff about you as an instrument that we never learn. And once you start teaching people those things, you see an astronomical improvement in basically like all dimensions of their life.
