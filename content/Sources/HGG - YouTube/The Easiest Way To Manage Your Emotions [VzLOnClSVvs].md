 There's one really simple way to manage your emotions. You don't even have to fix anything. All you need to do is give space before you go to bed for all that thinking that's gonna come anyway, right? Because when we go to bed, all the thinking comes. So you spend one hour and you're gonna say, oh my God, Dr. K, I don't have one hour. I'm so busy. Look at your phone. Look at your daily usage of your phone. And I would bet money that 95% of you have at least two hours a day on your phone. The average amount of cell phone use in the population today is around three hours and 45 minutes. And even at the top end, like 50% of people use up to five to six hours of technology usage, especially cell phones per day. So you have the hour. You just choose to waste it on your phone, which we both know. So you want one hour of unstructured mental activity. So what does that mean? You can go for a walk. You can journal if you want to. Just something where your mind is not occupied by something. At any point throughout the day, give your mind the space to emotionally decompress.
