 This is how you redefine yourself. If you hate the way that you look, you can eat an apple instead of a cookie. Your mind will tell you all of these things about who you are. And it's like, oh, like I feel so bad about myself and everyone else is so beautiful and I'm so ugly. Just eat an apple. It has nothing to do with all the crap in your head. And the crazy thing about this is that when you eat an apple, you start becoming the very thing that you want to be. And stop becoming that which you think you are. A human being's life is shaped by their actions. Not what other people think of them, not what they think of themselves. Action.
