 So the world is objectively becoming a more stressful place. And we're sort of seeing why this is happening, because as we can do more stuff at home, people are demanding more stuff of us at home. And so what is the natural response? How are human beings adapting to the stress? We tend to retreat to safe spaces. So we see that also that the Internet is kind of encouraging toxicity. What the Internet relies on is emotional engagement. A lot of the content that you click on on the Internet makes you feel worse. And so as these platforms are emotionally engaging us and stressing us out, we have to retreat to safe spaces. And by the way, since now we can talk to everyone from the Internet, I can find a thousand people who agree with me 100% and I can talk to a new person every day for three years. And I will only hear stuff that I already believe. These are echo chambers.
