 So if I have a goal that I want to be a millionaire and I work today and I earn $10, how does my brain interpret that? It looks at the effort that I put in and it says $10 is nowhere near my goal and that actually tanks my motivation because it looks at the situation that says, I have not moved sufficiently close to my goal. So the bigger our goal is, the harder it is for our brain to get on board with doing it. So the 25% rule is take anything that you want to accomplish and cut it in half and then cut it in half again. And this should be your first goal. At a minimum, you can even go smaller than that. You're at 12.5, there's no amount that is too small. But generally speaking, if you really look at it, the more ambitious your goals are, the harder they will be to achieve.
