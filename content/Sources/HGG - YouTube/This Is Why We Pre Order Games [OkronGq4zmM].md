 So here's how the mind works. The sensory inputs we have will determine which thoughts arise in our mind. And like game developers understand this really, really, really well. Because what do they do the three days before a game releases? They advertise heavily, they have a bunch of sponsored streams where streamers are playing the game, everyone's talking about it, they have teasers, they have this trailer, they have that trailer. Why are they doing that? What are they doing? The more sensory input that they can bombard you with, the more thoughts will arise in your head about that particular thing. And this is why how they get people to pre-order crap. Pre-ordering is a terrible idea because we keep on pre-ordering half-made games that end up being like defunct at launch, but like there's no, it doesn't cost the company any financial, it doesn't do anything because you've already given the money. And why do we pre-order? Because our mind is so overpopulated with thoughts of a particular game.
