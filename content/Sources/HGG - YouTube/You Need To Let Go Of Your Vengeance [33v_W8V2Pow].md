 And so what is it that people do anytime something bad happens to them their mind steps in and does all kinds of crap with it Either you Devalue it. Oh, there's some silver lining. It's okay in the end What only it doesn't kill you only makes you stronger this stuff this stuff this stuff or what happens is you're like Yeah, I deserved it right like I deserve to be hurt So that's why like that's how you make sense of it What we really need to do is like when bad stuff happens to you It happens to you. It has nothing to do with what your value as a human being It has nothing to do with anything. It's just there's no excuse. There's no reason. There's no positivity It is just and it happened to you. You don't deserve it. Someone else is a hole You can sometimes get overly focused on them to try to make it right, right? So he's like, oh they hurt me and i'm gonna hurt them and then what happens is you keep that hurt alive Every time you chase that person because that's your fuel baby. And so even if you end up with vengeance you pay the price
