 So the key thing that we need to understand is that if you want consistency, you have to start by understanding that you don't exist beyond today. That your life is actually a multiplayer game where random people are waking up in your life and get to live life one day at a time. But Dr. K, no, these are all these people are me. No, this is the problem. This is what the yogi said. This is Avidya. You don't know that this isn't actually you. You're just a random person living this life one day at a time. And that may sound weird, but think about it for a second, right? Because what do you love to do? You love to screw over tomorrow you and then you wake up tomorrow. And then who do you get mad at? You get mad at the dude that came before you, right? Because that person, damn it, why didn't that guy do this crap that needed to be done? Instead, I'm waking up today and I have all this stuff that this person yesterday did not do. So if you really stop and think about it, the basic problem with life is that you don't recognize that you only get to live for this moment in time.
