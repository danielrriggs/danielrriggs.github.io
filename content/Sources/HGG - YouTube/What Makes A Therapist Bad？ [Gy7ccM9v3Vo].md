 What makes a therapist bad? What a great question. So let's talk about this. A good therapist listens. A good therapist adapts to your needs. So what we mean by listen is as a therapist, it's your job to take everything that you've learned and not apply 90% of it to your patient. This is the difference between a good therapist and a bad therapist. The bad therapists, in my opinion, are the ones that have learned a lot of stuff and they come in and they say, oh look at all the stuff that I know, I will apply it to you. We're going to make you a standard fast food sandwich with no customization because this is what works. Good therapists are the ones that recognize which parts of their knowledge don't apply to this person. Which parts of their knowledge need to be adapted to this person.
