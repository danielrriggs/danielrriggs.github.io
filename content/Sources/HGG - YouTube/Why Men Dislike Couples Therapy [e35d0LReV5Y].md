 So we're okay with men being sad, thankfully, but we're not okay with them expressing other emotions, because those are weak. Those are toxic masculine, especially the anger one. That one's the one that's the crazy. It's also the emotion that men have the most access to. So when we say we're gonna emotionally accept men, we're gonna emotionally accept a minority of your emotional experience, right? So just to give you all an example, if you have a relationship with two people, and one person gets angry and one person cries, what is the judgment that we place on those negative emotions? What we always do is we value the sadness over the anger. We don't say that you have a right to be angry. If you're angry and this person is crying, you did something bad. We place a value on sadness that is above anger. And if two negative emotions collide, sadness always wins. And then if we look at differentials in the way that different genders express emotions, women are more likely to cry and men are more likely to get angry. And this is why men are scared to go to couples therapy, because they are outgunned. Because we don't treat all negative emotions the same.
