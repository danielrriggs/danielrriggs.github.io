 But at Healthy Gamer, one of the things that we've come to realize is that technology is here and it's here to stay. That sort of treating it like the enemy is actually not the right move. Instead, I think the real problem with technology right now is that it's been developed and used by people who are not trying to accomplish noble pursuits. They're developing technology to try to sell video games and entertain people. If we look at things like social media, I don't think that social media platforms are evil, but I don't think that the people who develop social media platforms, their primary goal is to make the world a better place. Their primary goal is to try to disseminate content, generate ad revenue, and they're sort of that's their their primary goal.
