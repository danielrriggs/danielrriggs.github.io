 It may sound kind of bizarre, but it turns out that the most important thing that you can control for your own happiness is actually your thoughts. Now this may sound surprising because isn't happiness about emotions? Because if I'm depressed and sad all the time and I wake up and I feel ashamed of myself and I'm so depressed and it's hard to get out of bed, it's hard for me to be happy, right? That makes perfect sense, so isn't it about emotion? Well, it turns out that if you look at research on psychiatry and psychotherapy, that emotions are a big part of it, but if you really look at what we do in psychotherapy, it's not just fixing emotions. In fact, the goal is to decompress emotions so that you can help your patients start to think clearly. And the real change that we see happens when our patients start to think clearly and think in a healthier way.
