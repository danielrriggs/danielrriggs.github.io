 In order to have a discussion with someone else about emotions, we have to be aware of what we're feeling, right? It's very hard to have a discussion with someone when we don't even know what we feel. That's actually part of the reason that we have discussions with people, by the way, is to figure out what we feel. But it starts with some amount of awareness of your own emotions. So like this person does, you can journal or something like that, but just start to think a little bit about, okay, what am I feeling right now? Is it physical? Is it mental? Where in space am I feeling a negative emotion or a positive emotion? Why am I feeling this way? So you have to have some amount of awareness of emotions.
