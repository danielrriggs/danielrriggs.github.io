 So when people have addictions, is that people with addictions are not aware of what they're doing. So I'll have patients who will be sober for six months, and they'll come in one week and they'll say, I don't know what happened, doc. I just woke up and then I slipped up. I just started drinking again. And if you look at neuroscience studies of people who have addictions, they have a lack of awareness of their internal emotional state. So what's literally happening with people with addictions is they'll try to break the habit, right? That's really what an addiction is. It's a really powerful habit. And so what they'll do is resist with willpower over time, but eventually they'll slip up because over that six month period, at some point, stress is going to start increasing. At some point, there's conflict within their relationship or their friends aren't inviting them to stuff. So that's internal stress builds up. And as that internal stress builds up, they're not really aware of it. And then eventually the stress gets so bad that they have to use something like alcohol as a coping mechanism. But the whole point is that people with addictions are blind to this process.
