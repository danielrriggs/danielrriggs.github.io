 How do I be proud of myself? You actually stop and you ask yourself, what did I do to deserve this? And usually that phrase sounds like, what did I do to deserve this? This guy is feeding in mid. Oh my God, what did I do? What past karmas have I done to have this new on my team? But you can use what did I do to deserve this for like positive stuff too. And we asked that question rhetorically, like I didn't do anything to deserve this. That's incorrect. You did something. You showed up. You did some amount of preparation. You studied a little bit. You went out on a limb. You asked for help. There's something that you did. And then you can give yourself a pat on the back for that tiny little bit.
