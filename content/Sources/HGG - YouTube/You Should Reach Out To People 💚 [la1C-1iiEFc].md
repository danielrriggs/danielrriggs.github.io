 When you reach out to other people, even though it might feel a little weird or unusual, if you're not used to doing that, just know that you will almost always feel better having done it and the person you reached out to will feel better too, even more so because it's become a more unusual thing for people to do in modern life. But if I write someone a letter, aren't they going to think I'm weird? Isn't that a weird thing to do? Well, you don't have to write them a letter. You can call them if you want. But if you did choose to write them a letter, they would probably think it's very unusual. My guess, from my own experience, is that they would probably be touched that, hey, you thought enough of them to actually write them a letter. I think you're doing something super cool here, which I think is subtle. So I asked you, do you think it's weird? And you said, it's probably unusual. And I think even the way that you're talking about it is really interesting because my word choice is loaded with judgment, which I think is actually a huge part of what people nowadays struggle with. They're like, if I just pick up the phone and call, I was thinking about you, that can seem creepy. You know?
