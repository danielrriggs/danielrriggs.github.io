 So this is the other problem with shame. When we feel ashamed by something on the internet, our brain cannot see a path to actually achieve that. And then we feel paralyzed because on the one hand, we feel this is what I should become. And on the other hand, we look at this person, we say, this is impossible for me. So then what do I end up doing? Absolutely nothing. Why does shame arise when other people are not shaming us? Because of what it's triggered by. Shame is triggered by a gap in where you are and where you think you should be. That is literally what shame is. I should be here. I am here. Boom, shame. And now even without people, all you have to do is see other people doing the stuff that you wanna do and that'll trigger shame because it notices a gap. If you really pay attention, this is what you'll discover. Anytime you experience shame, you are going to be making a comparison. Wow, look at this person is this way, but I am this way. And we have people out there whose job it is to be the best version of a particular thing, like a fitness influencer. And part of the model is make you feel ashamed of yourself and this is what advertisers have figured out. The more shame they can create in you, the more you're gonna spend money.
