 biggest problem that we're seeing right now is that no one is critical of their perceptive faculties. No one trains their perception. So what happens if you don't train your perception is whatever someone else wants to convey, you're just going to let sink in. And so what that sort of means, if we really think about that, that means that other people are capable of controlling your mind. And even though that sounds insane, we've been doing this for years, right? This is what advertising is about. We are going to shape your thinking. We're going to shape the thinking of the customer to try to induce behavior, advertising, marketing. This is all forms of mind control. So what we don't realize is that the whole world is getting very good at manipulating our mind. And we don't even realize that it's happening. We think that all of these thoughts are well thought out, right? We'll say like, Oh, I did my research. What do you mean you did your research? What is your research? I watched things on Tik TOK.
