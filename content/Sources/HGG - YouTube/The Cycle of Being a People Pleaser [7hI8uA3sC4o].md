 So if we look at the nature of the cycle of being a people pleaser, it is that what happens in here and what someone else tells me become intertwined. There's no independence. Whether you feel good about yourself depends upon other people being happy with you. And if you literally look at that, that means that you are not in control of your own feelings in your own life. Because in order to feel good, you have to help other people be happy. And if they're not happy with you, then you feel bad. Do you see that? For you to separate your sense of who you are from what the world wants you to be. Let me listen to what this person is saying. Let me see where this person is coming from. And let me do my best to understand their point of view. So you don't have to reject it outright. In fact, you have to be careful because a part of your ego may love this and may say, yeah, now I get to tell everyone to go themselves because it's not part of my masculinity. That's your ego. Make a choice on your own. Listen to what they say and then decide, OK, is this person right in their assessment? Give it your honest best. And as long as you remove ego from the equation, you can look at it.
