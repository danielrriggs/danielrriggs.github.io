 Love is a couple of different things. It's reciprocal. It tends to be two-way, right? I love my kids, my kids love me, and if one of those pieces of love kind of disappears, it kind of falls apart. The other thing about love that separates it from addiction is love is about the other person, right? So when I really love someone, I do things for them. I'm willing to sacrifice for them. And this is exactly how we sort of end up in the simp realm, right? Is that we start sacrificing for the sake of this other person. So isn't that love? No. There's a big difference because in simping, you are actually looking for something. If you really pay attention to yourself, the reason that it's an addiction, what separates love from an addiction is an addiction. You're looking for something from this person, and this is why you're so damn frustrated that they don't give it to you. This is why you hate them. This is why we start hating women because they don't give us what we need. And we also start hating ourselves because, damn it, why am I so addicted to this crap? I'm giving everything and I'm not getting anything in return. So we build up all of this resentment. That is the picture of an addiction.
