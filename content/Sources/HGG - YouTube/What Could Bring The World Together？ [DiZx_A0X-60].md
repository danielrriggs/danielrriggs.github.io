 Early on, I was an intern, so fresh out of med school. I was seeing a patient in the emergency room, and they told me that their parent had just passed away. And I said, I'm so sorry for your loss. And they looked at me like I was Medusa. And they said my parent had been physically abusive my entire life. When they passed away a week ago, it was the most relieving thing I've ever experienced. And I was like, holy crap. That never crossed my mind. We assume that all parents are good parents, and everyone misses their parents when they die, because it's very common, right? But what I learned that day is that everyone's experience of life is different. And just because your life existed a particular way, does not mean that other people's lives existed that way. And why do we assume this stuff? Because we don't hear or listen to the experiences of other people's lives. And that's what we're here to combat. And we think that bringing the world and the internet together happens through dialogue and listening.
