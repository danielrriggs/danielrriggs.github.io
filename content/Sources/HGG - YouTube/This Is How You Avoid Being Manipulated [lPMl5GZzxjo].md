 The whole point of manipulation is they're not going to ask you for anything. They're going to induce emotions that makes you do it anyway. There's no space for recognition. There's no space for appreciation. It's always fixing problems. So what you really need to learn how to do is separate out emotions from actions. Go through that process, right? And say like, okay, what does it feel like to not engage in the behavior? What would happen if I just ride this emotion out? And then your mind is going to tell you, no, no, you need to do it. You need to do it because it's your fault and blah, blah, blah. And hold on a second. The most important thing is if you feel like you need to do something, the one thing that I would recommend is that you do it with a clear head. So wait until you are a completely clear head and then tell your mind we can do this thing. No problem. We can absolutely do it. I'm just going to wait till I'm calm. Wait till tomorrow, take a deep breath, wake up fresh in the morning, go for a walk, and then decide what you need to do. You will be amazed at how that changes your behavior. So just delay, delay giving into the emotion, okay?
