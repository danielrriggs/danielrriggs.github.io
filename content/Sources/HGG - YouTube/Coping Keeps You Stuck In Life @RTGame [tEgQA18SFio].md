 I recently saw a study that I thought was really fascinating, that people who develop very strong emotional coping mechanisms tend to not progress in life. Okay. It's kind of weird, right? Because you think like ingrained in the habit almost, is it? Well, so I think what happens is if I'm in a bad situation, let's say I'm in an abusive relationship and I get really, really good at coping, am I more likely to stay in the relationship or less likely to stay in the relationship? Yeah. That's actually a fair point. And yeah, because if you're just trying to cope all the time, then you're just going to fall in almost that habit loop. And it's like, where is staring into the face is like, hey, maybe you should get out of this, you know? Maybe, maybe it's better. Like, yeah, absolutely. It's really bizarre. I was stunned when I saw the study, but like there's really they were talking about how the better you are at coping, the more stuck, the more likely you are to stay stuck.
