 Hi, my name is Alok Kanodja. My name is? I'm Dr. K. Let's go, come on. Welcome to Dr. K's Guide. Look, I can do the actual teaching, but this kind of stuff just feels weird. Like this is, I can't. You want me to do it? Yeah, go for it. Okay, I got you. All yours. Let's have her now. Hey guys, I want to tell you a little bit about the latest addition to Dr. K's Guide to Mental Health. My name is Kriti, I'm the CEO of Healthy Gamer. I have watched Alok for about a year, spent every waking minute researching trauma. We've been lucky enough to support thousands of mental health journeys all over the internet. It's gonna take you through the physiology, the emotions, relationships, spiritual perspectives, and clinical perspectives. Everything you need to know to really just move step by step. I really hope it helps. All the information you need is in the links below. Thanks.
