 Negative emotions activate the reticular activating system. And by the way, reticular activating system is what wakes you up. So as long as we're like stressed out or anxious, we can't go to sleep. And now we begin to see this problem of I really need to go to sleep. Because when you really need to go to sleep, what are you feeling internally? You're feeling anxious, you're feeling worried. And that in turn activates your stress system, activates all these different hormones that then turn on your reticular activating system. You all may have noticed this, that when you go to bed, finally, when you're done with a device, all of these negative emotions start flooding up. If you try to go to bed on time, what is the experience of someone who actually goes to bed on time? They sit there and their mind is hyperactive, sometimes even flooded with negative emotions. And so how do we fix that problem? What we do is we wait until the fatigue is so high that we just get zonked out. Or what we end up doing is using a device to keep emotions at bay and thoughts until we pass out with the device, you fall asleep watching something.
