 So who are you? So who you are is determined by your actions. So you can say that, okay, I'm afraid of heights, therefore, I cannot climb, right? These are very common things, something that I struggled with and still struggle with. So if we sort of think about it, once you say, I'm afraid of heights, I cannot climb a mountain, you will not climb the mountain. This results in a lack of motivation, not fulfilling your dreams, missing out on opportunities, FOMO, whatever, all that crap. But the problem here is that you are letting your identity of yourself determine what you actually do. Whereas the real tragedy is what you do determines who you are, right? So if I'm afraid of heights and I end up climbing a mountain anyway, how do I feel about myself? I feel amazing. I feel like, wow, even though I'm afraid of heights, I am so awesome. I'm so proud of myself that I was able to conquer that. And once you're someone who starts conquering your deficits, you become a whole different person.
