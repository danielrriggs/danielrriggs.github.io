 The reason that men are reluctant to go to couples counseling is because they are not good with verbal expression of their emotional state. So anytime they go into couples counseling, they feel outgunned because their female partner is able to like articulate their emotional experience better. It feels like the therapist ends up understanding and siding with the female partner more. And this is where the society jumps to a conclusion and says, OK, so this is a problem that you guys have as men. You need to learn how to talk about your emotions more. Therein lies the bias. We never stop to ask ourselves, hold on a second, if men are not very good at talking about their emotions, are there different ways to manage emotions? And if you look at historically the way that men manage emotions, we have all kinds of things that are different. We are much more physical and that's viewed as a negative thing, right? If you have a problem with someone, you should articulate it out. So already we're starting to see that the way that our society judges particular things, we place articulation of emotions above physical expression of emotions.
