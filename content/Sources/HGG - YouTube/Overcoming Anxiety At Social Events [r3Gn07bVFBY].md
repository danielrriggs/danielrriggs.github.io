 So I remember going through this process in college where like I decided I was going to try to be more social. I would leave the room. I would say like, okay, I didn't want to go to the party, didn't want to go to the party, didn't want to go to the party. And what I realized is that I could mentally reset by taking a shower. So I'd take a shower and then I'd get dressed for the party. And then like if I could do that, then I could get out the door. As I'm walking over to the party, all kinds of anxieties are going through my head. What about this? What about this? What about this? Just process those, like acknowledge what you're feeling in those moments at the party. Like, you know, okay, this is going to be scary, things like that. And then there may even be certain things that you can reassure yourself with, right? Which is that I'm going to go to the party, but I have to stay for four hours. I'm going to try to have a good time for half an hour or one hour. If I'm not feeling it, I can always come home and play Diablo. So but I'm going to stay for at least half an hour or one hour. So I'd promise myself half an hour, but I'd really shoot for one hour. Okay, we're going to do minimum of half an hour. But if we can hit one hour, like that's an accomplishment. And then I'd go and then I'd be like intentional about talking to people. And what do you know? Time would fly by. Oh, two hours has gone by.
