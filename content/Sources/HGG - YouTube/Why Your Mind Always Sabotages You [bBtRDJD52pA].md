 What is your mind telling you to do? You should want all of this stuff because all those desires have been implanted within you. So it's trying to trick you into telling you that this isn't enough. When it tells you those things, what is it actually trying to convince you to do? It's trying to tell you, oh, you can't just do 1%. You need to go 100% or nothing because your mind knows you're not going to go 100%. So what your mind is actually doing in that moment is trying to convince you to do nothing and just continue doing exactly what you're doing because it's doing the cost benefit analysis and it's kind of saying, hey, actually we can get a ton of benefit by just watching YouTube and playing video games every day. So don't bother with that other crap. It never works. We've tried it before and so we know it's not worth it. So you've got to be super careful about that pitfall. Just notice what it's kind of trying to accomplish. Notice that's kind of trying to keep you stuck because the mind does this really interesting trick is that it convinces you that you don't want to change. That's what it's trying to do, right? Saying it's not worth it. And if it's not worth it, then we don't want to do it. And if we don't want to do it, we can continue doing what we're doing.
