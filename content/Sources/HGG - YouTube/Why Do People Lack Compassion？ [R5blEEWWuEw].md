 what really bothers me about this, or I think what we need to acknowledge, is I want you to like look at where your lack of compassion is coming from. Why is it that when someone says, hey, this hurts a lot, this is what pain looks like, this is devastating for me, why is it that you can't hear what they're saying? Because chances are you have probably experienced the exact same thing that that person is experiencing. Because I would bet money that if you are an a**hole towards people who are victims of non-consensual pornography, there have been times in your life where you told someone else, hey, I'm really suffering, and everyone ignored you. What did people tell you, especially if you're a man? You don't deserve to suffer. What are you complaining about? It comes with the f**king territory, because this is what we tell men who suffer. You're privileged, right? And so what happens to us? We hear this stuff, we reach out for help, we say, hey, I'm hurting, and the world turns to us and says, screw you, you should be able to handle it. Comes with the territory. The world has treated us like s**t, so we're going to turn around and treat other people like s**t.
