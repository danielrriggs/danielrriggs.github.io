 games have become a way to socialize. So a lot of parents don't recognize is that when you restrict the game, you are also taking away your child's social support network. And so a lot of the resistance that kids will send their parents ways because they're actually getting many psychological needs met by the video game. And imagine if I were to tell you, hey, like for the next two weeks, you're not allowed to see a single person that you like, right? That's what parents don't realize what they're really taking away from the kids. And if we feel anxious or depressed, that can tank our mood even more. 100% right. So people who get addicted to video games are much more likely to be on the autism spectrum, they're much more likely to have a mood or anxiety disorder. So there's a lot of things that people, especially kids will use games to cope. And there's data that shows that games do regulate our emotions. So they shut off our negative emotional circuitry in the brain.
