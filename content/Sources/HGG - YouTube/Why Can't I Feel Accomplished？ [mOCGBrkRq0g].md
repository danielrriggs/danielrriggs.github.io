 If stress is what's motivating our action, how on earth are we supposed to feel a sense of accomplishment when it's done? So think about the times in your life when you feel accomplished. Stress can have something to do with it, but it's usually like something that you set out to do. The first thing to understand is that if you're motivated through stress and procrastination, the natural thing is that you're going to end up with a sense of relief instead of a sense of accomplishment. What are you expecting? So other people, you may look around with other people who are like high-fiving each other because, yeah, like I crushed the exam, fantastic. Those people weren't super stressed before they started the exam. So even though you studied hard and you should feel proud of yourself, the question is what was the driver of the original motivation? And your internal motivation is going to determine whether you end up feeling relief or accomplished.
