 And this is how you be chill. Think about the long term, right? This one person, there's a thousand other people out there. Just give this a shot and think about even if this does not work well, your goal in this, if it works out great, if it doesn't work out, you will get better at managing yourself. So everything in life is about creating a better you for tomorrow. Now you've been rejected by one person. This will make the second rejection easier. You've leveled up a little bit. So think about the long game. Your conversation with this person will be easier, right? Because when they say no, you're not torn out of shape. You can say, thank you very much for telling me how you feel. I hope we can still continue to maintain a friendship. If it becomes weird for you, please let me know. If it becomes hard for me, I will let you know. And then you fist bump, and then you move on with your life, right? So this is how we get so caught up with our attachments, because it's all we give our mind time to do.
