 Hi, hey, what's going on? Good to meet you too Yeah, where do I start I'm what you can call me flow perfect, bro We've talked before I was on one of your pawn addiction streams a while back ah Good to see you again. What? Thank you. Good to speak to you again Um so my age is 22 and I'm a software engineer in Germany, mm-hmm and my question was how do I tell my parents that I was suicidal as a kid and That I'm currently fighting depression basically without hurting them or blaming them for Like what happened to me Do you blame them for what happened to you I think that Yeah, a part of my how I was brought up definitely plays a role in it like Yeah, I Blame them. I mean like I see them as flawed people, but I think some of their actions Yeah, make me who I am I think So, okay If you want I can give you like a background Okay, so I do want a background but just in a moment are you watching stream I closed it good Okay, so I do want a background but just in a moment are you watching stream I Closed it good Give me just one moment. Okay, sure Okay, so why don't you tell me a little bit about You know what so help me understand a little bit about your you wanna You want to talk to your family about You want to share your you want to tell your parents that you're suicidal and you're depressed Yeah, right and You're having difficult but you want to share it in a way that prevents them from Feeling blamed Yes So Uh-huh. Yeah, so tell me a little bit more so basically So my family situation parents are still together I have a sister an older one and My parents weren't really like an emotional support when I grew up so they were like Really distance we never talked about how we felt And They would usually like showed their love through like financial support Like my mom was like pretty dominant and actually thinks like that people that go and do therapy are basically crazy and That it's pretty uncommon to go to therapy. So she has like a bias a strong bias about that and my dad is like a lot more approachable, but Very passive and Basically, I never shared That I am in therapy with them or that I was depressed Because I'm afraid of their reaction and They found out a while ago that my Sister is in therapy and their reaction is They found out a while ago that my Sister is in therapy and their reaction was kind of scary as well. Like first of all, they're really confused what happened to her or why she is in therapy because she's so distanced that she doesn't want to talk about it and Now I feel like this might be the right time to open up to them and Although we never talk about emotions like Yeah, just just kind of I kind of want want some relief from Being able to tell them how I really feel if they ask me like like we we meet from time to time We don't live together anymore and if they ask me how I'm doing I'm Not telling them if I had like a really bad day, for example So and why don't you tell them that you have a bad day? Because it would usually lead into I had like lots of anxiety today and I'm working on XYZ Through my therapy and then I would just open up Like yeah, so what I'm hearing is that you By the way, just to clarify are we showing your face or not? Because I know you're on a video call. I However you want I don't I don't mind okay, let me just go to our interview screen then okay, so So are we showing faces Someone else joined the channel, but I don't know Oh Wait, can they hear the pain? I'm sorry Yeah, they can it's okay though. I mean, I guess I have the notification on it's okay So flow let's just think a little bit about so on the one hand This is what I'm hearing. The first thing is that you've been struggling with some of these issues of depression and suicidality for a while It sounds like your parents won't be very open to hearing that and so what I'm hearing is that you're essentially Carrying this burden kind of on your own and it's not that you expect your parents to really fix it for you But that you're afraid of their judgment And and I think that you know the people that we love we just you know, we want them to Support us, you know, even if it's not like in a big way like at least emotionally I mean you want to tell your parents what you're going through but you're afraid of how they're gonna react so you're not and This is where things get really tricky because like not only you're trying to you know avoid their judgment that but there's also a part of you that is You know afraid that They did have some role in it and that they won't respond very well to like that idea Is what I'm hearing so in a weird way You know there You're almost kind of protecting them by keeping it from them But you're carrying an extra heavy burden because of that in a weird way. Does that make sense? Yes, that that yeah applies so So let me so there so there are a couple of principles at play here But first I'm gonna just answer your question and then I'm gonna share one or two principles. Okay So I think the way that you tell them is just like that. So you just say mom dad I just you know there's some there's a part of my life that I haven't really shared with you very much because I've been afraid of your judgment and You know, I was suicidal when I was younger and I've been struggling with depression a lot like my sister for a couple of years Now and I just wanted y'all to know Now there are a couple of important pieces there. So one is like your expectation about the conversation is gonna be a lot of your suffering Okay, so, you know who your parents are and it can be sad but try to let go of that expectation and You know, I do think that it is possible to get to a place where your parents can support you And I think the most important part is the next part Which is that the first conversation shouldn't be one where you're sharing a lot of information It should be one where you're asking a few questions if you can manage it And I would start with the question what's your understanding of what depression is? Like when I say that I was suicidal and I've been depressed for years like what does that mean to you and Listen to what they have to say and Be aware that you know part of their defensiveness may be a sense of blame Like they may be like blaming themselves and their ego arises in response to that So like I know it's really hard but I don't know that they're gonna be in a place to listen it just sort of depends But if you're wondering how you have that first conversation, I think being honest about it Being simple like it's like one or two sentences. It's not a whole lot of explanation. It's not a whole lot of excuses It's not a whole lot of it's not your fault where really they do have something like, you know You can you can get down that that road later But I'd say, you know two or three sentences and then what does that mean to you? And then really listen to them How does that sound Yeah, I think it sounds good it sounds like a like I didn't think about Kind of asking them for their understanding of what I'm going through so but I Like you you said something about expectation which is like my expectation right now is that they really don't know what depression really is like they have like Not a lot of knowledge about mental health in general, so That's and I got that impression as well from Seeing their real life experience As well from seeing their reaction to finding out that my sister is in therapy, so Yeah, so I gotta let go of the expectations yeah, so but let's talk about the expectation for a second. What do you What do you feel? like How does it how do you feel knowing that they're not going to respond to you? Or imagining they won't respond to you with like support That's really hard It kind of adds to the general sense I have when I'm with my parents, which is Lots of times like feeling worthless, so it's like Such a big step to tell them about it, and if they don't care then or they Like I I know that my mom for a fact will tell me that there's probably something wrong with me and I am I have caused my Suffering which is true to some extent, but Kind of not what you want to hear in this situation, so it's Yep, yeah, it's just Feel really sad right now thinking about it Because it's like they don't care Yep, I I know exactly how you feel man I think it can be really really challenging And So what we're gonna try to do is like so this is where flow I think So it sounds like you do have a therapist right? Yes, okay, so I think you know you should definitely lean on them, but I I think Okay, so I think you know you should definitely lean on them But I think there are a couple things that I I want to kind of share with you one is that You know so it's that attitude so somewhere along the way you were sort of taught that You're to blame Yeah, right so so if we look at it's it's I'm gonna just take a step back and explain something so Sigmund Freud Conceptualized depression is anger turned against the self And so you blame yourself for everything like You know your mom and like if we think about where did you learn how to blame yourself like unfortunately a lot of times we've learned from our parents and Sorry, yeah, go ahead I wasn't like the The healthy gamer coaching like the free coaching for a while And it's something that I talked to Adam about a lot and he he actually asked me like what did your Parents tell you that Could lead to the self of like self-worth that you have right now and Something they always told me was basically since growing up like when you were born we had to move out of our bedroom in order to make place for you and Like this is not your bedroom. It's ours, but we made space for you So I was kind of already blame blame for Being born because I was always I was already a burden for them because they had to leave the room. So Yeah, that's deep It does go deep and and what I'm hearing is that even in this conversation You're taking over a part of their peaceful mental household, too They have this beautiful house built in their head of what their what their life is like and what their children's life is like And it's pretty imperfect and you know, you're occupying the space that you're supposed to occupy and By telling them this what you're gonna do is move into their spare bedroom That wasn't the life that they felt right, and how does it feel to Take space that isn't yours Feels really bad Yeah Right. So what I want you to understand so now comes the good part, but also the hard part is that flow these These thoughts that you have are like they're like a parrot that is just repeating What it's heard right? These are your parents thoughts. They're not actually a measure of your value Like they're not you know, they're not true. They're just like echoes and So I think that that process and this is where you know, if we want to be a little bit Forgiving So I think one way to move forward here is to forgive But in order to forgive you have to blame them first Right, and this is where the tricky part comes in whereas like if you can never move your thoughts If it's not like if you don't blame them, you can't forgive them Because I certainly did a number on you. I think everyone's aware of that Yeah, and and so I'm not saying you have to forgive them right away But I think that like, you know, if you say they don't understand mental health and stuff like understand that their response to you Sure, there's some stuff that you know, we can blame them for but some of that is like they may just not understand mental health And so I think the first conversation is sort of like a conversation about hey, here's what I'm going through What's your understanding of it because in your mind a lot of the fears that you have are fair A lot of the blame that you have is fair a lot of the ways that they make you feel like you don't belong here Right, so I'm imagining that you're pulling them into a conversation where they don't want to be And you're kind of inconveniencing them by having it So there's all of that which is like a samskar and then there's also the mental health stigma Which is actually has nothing to do with you and nothing to do with them It's just if they haven't learned it and so you're going to be fighting two battles One is sort of a more traditional one and one is like this mental health stigma battle And this is where I encourage you to you know, lean on your therapist lean on us. Welcome back. It's good to see you again And and you know, we're here to help you and you have a lot of people in your life who do care about you Who want you to be here who enjoy seeing you? I love to see you again. I think it's fantastic that you're back You know, I wish you know at some point i'd like to talk about happier things But i'm i'm more than happy to talk about this right now because we meet people where they're at Right, and what you've got to do is meet people meet your parents where they're at It's hard man, i'm sorry Yeah, it's um Yeah, I don't know if I'm gonna say this but It's um Yeah, I just I just really hope that I will feel at least some relief So my hope is that the relief that you're gonna feel is one of like detachment where you can't really control the people that they are You can just take the first step of the journey like you just because the journey isn't going to wind up where you want it to go Doesn't mean that you shouldn't take that first step And what I want you to do is take that first step and like You know, it's going to be a step in the right direction. It may not go the way that you want to And you hopefully still have you know years if not a decade or two To get to a place where you're you know, you can educate your parents and they can support you And hopefully you can kind of come out of that depression a little bit and explain to them So take take the first step even though it sounds really scary Sounds like it's meeting your some scar head on Yeah, I I kind of decided to talk to my dad first because I think he Is a lot more approachable with that. So I he'll he'll come over tomorrow. So it's um, oh wow Yeah Okay Well, good luck to you, man. Yeah, thank you. Yeah Okay, thank you so much for having me you're very welcome Hope to hear again, you know keep us posted
