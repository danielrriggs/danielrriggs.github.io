 So what you need to do is the moment you start to have romantic feelings for someone in your life, the natural idea is to hide these, right? Because, oh, this person is just my friend, and if I tell them, like, they're going to reject me, and we're just friends and girls don't like to be girlfriends, and so I can't say anything. And this is where actually you can say something. And what you can say can be really, really impactful, helpful, and actually maintain the friendship. And this is what you can say, hey, so I know we've been friends for a little while, but I'm starting to notice, like, some kind of romantic feelings. What do you think about that? So have a conversation with your friend. I know it sounds terrifying, but approach them kind of as a friend. Like, hey, like, we have a relationship, right? Like, hey, I have this pile of feelings, and like, what do you think we should do about these feelings? Should I suppress them? Should I let them go? Could you possibly feel the same way? Have you ever felt that way about me? And just have a frank conversation about it.
