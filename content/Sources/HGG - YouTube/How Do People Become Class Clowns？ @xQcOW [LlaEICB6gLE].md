 Yeah, I grew up. I was one year in advance in school. So everybody was like, when everybody was 18, I was 17. So like, yeah, I mean, sometimes I kind of like made fun of it, which is fine. I don't know that that was a big problem. Because I was like a class clown. It's kind of how I made up for it. But yeah, but when you become the class clown, you also become a little bit invisible. Oh, yeah. Oh, wow. That's I'm actually surprised you're gonna well, I think you're knowledgeable. So yeah, you know that I want to hear your take on it. Well, because then they're not seeing you, right? They're seeing you perform. They're seeing a version of you. Yeah, okay. That's not really who you are. Like, everyone's gonna pay attention to you as long as you're making them laugh. But if you say, hey, I'm hurting today, what are they gonna do? Yeah, I never understood why that was the case. And I think I'm starting to get it now. Is that true for you today? Yeah, I think it might be. And why is that? I guess I performed so much that I just I guess I'm like a natural performer, I guess that it's always on. I think that's part of it. But I think there's something else going on, which is that the moment that someone doesn't treat you that way, you sabotage the relationship. Okay, yeah, well, that's insightful.
