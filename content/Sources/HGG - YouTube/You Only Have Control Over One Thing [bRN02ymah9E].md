 And how do I know how much power and control I actually have over my life? So this is really simple to understand. It's simple. I guess it's hard to understand. The power and control that you have is fundamentally only over one thing, which is your actions. You can't control what happens. You just control what you do. So in the case of this depression, it's very simple. What I control is whether I go to therapy or not. I don't control whether therapy prevents me from becoming depressed again. I don't control whether I make a breakthrough in therapy or not. What I control is whether I make an appointment with a psychiatrist and whether I go. I don't control whether the medication they prescribe works like a miracle or doesn't work at all. I can't control my own treatment resistance or my own biology, but I can control whether I try or not.
