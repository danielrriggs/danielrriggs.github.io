 Welcome to twitch and thank you for being here Do you want to just tell us a little bit about? You know how you like to be addressed and you can call me today call me about my first day Okay, and you can call me all oak if you would like to sure So welcome Vivek and I understand that you're Surgeon General of the United States. That's right. What's that like? It's a it's an incredible privilege to be able to serve and it's different every day as people often ask me What's a typical day in the life and it's it's quite different some days I you know traveling to communities across the country working with people on Some of our priority issues whether that's mental health or or other issues that they're concerned about Other days I'm here working with a lot of our strategic partners in Washington DC both in and outside of government And we're always building in new initiatives and launching new products, you know, most recently we Launched an initiative around addressing loneliness and isolation which are profound challenges For the country as well as some broader topics related to mental health including social media use so it's an incredible You know the job and an experience and at least something happens once a day I would say at least once a day that reminds me of how Just what a blessing it is to be able to serve in this capacity so Awesome, man. So can you just tell us a little bit? So I know y'all have released three advisories and like rapid pacing So one on youth mental health one on isolation and loneliness and one on social media Can you tell us like what's going on with like mental health in this country today? Yeah, so we have Released a number of advisories related to youth mental health and mental health I'd say more broadly and the reason we've done that is because In COVID-19 the pandemic we've come through This has really put a real strain on people's mental health and well-being and we're seeing it in the numbers in terms of anxiety and depression But we are also we also know that even long even before the pandemic long before COVID-19 arrived There was a mental health crisis in America We did kids for example The decade prior to the pandemic there was a 57% increase in the suicide rate among young people and we had seen in the day also the decade prior to the pandemic that More and more high school students were saying that they felt persistently sad or hopeless and that number now stands close to half and so we knew that there was a problem beforehand and Sadly the pandemic poured fuel on that fire But the reason that I've made this a priority and why we have worked on some mental health from so many different angles is Because I really believe that mental health is a fuel that allows us to Show up in our lives at work at school for our families for our communities and many of us know this actually intuitively like if you think about a Day when you were struggling with your mental health or a period that you went through When you were having a tough time with your mental health But most people know that that was a time where sometimes it was harder to really focus on work or to do work or maybe You didn't do as well in school or you weren't able to just be present with your friends You know with your family members as much as you normally would maybe you tended to volunteer less or engage less in your community our mental health is is Really what impacts how we show up in the world and so addressing mental health to me is really key To addressing not just the health of individuals, but the health of society more broadly Wow Okay, and and what do you think we can do about that? Like what should like Social media is is all over the place. Like how do we handle this because we're growing up in this environment, right? Well, we are and one thing I need to realize is that as big as a Challenge as mental health is there are actually a lot of things we can do as individuals to help not only ourselves but other people with their mental health and well-being and You know, this is in addition, of course to all of the policy actions that we have to take and the programmatic You know changes that we with a weekend That we can take on which will help make mental health care more available to people that will help invest in prevention That will help to ensure that we're using technology in particular to bring care to where people are as Opposed to waiting for them to drive 30 miles and wait three months to get an appointment So there's a lot that we have to do in terms of programs and policies To make care more available and address the root causes of mental illness But as individuals it turns out there's a lot we can do too so like number one we know That strengthening the social connection in our life helps with mental health when people struggle with loneliness and isolation It actually increases their risk of depression anxiety and suicide So think about this for a moment like each of us most of us are living busy lives, right? And a lot of times what gets edged out in those busy lives are our people, right? But if we can take 15 minutes a day To reach out to people we care about if we can make sure that when we're talking to get friends catching up with family members That we're actually fully present Who during our conversations that we're not distracted by devices These are simple ways that we can actually start to strengthen our relationships again the second thing that we can do is we can be mindful of our use of technology Recognizing that technology in the end-of-day it can be a blessing or a curse it can help it can hurt it depends how it's designed and how we use it and What has happened in the last you know a couple of decades is that? Technology has really taken over so many elements of our life we get up first thing we do so many times Let's look at our devices, and it's the last thing we see before we go to bed at night, but it's also Invaded our space for conversation. It's taken the time that we perhaps had when we were just thinking or reflecting or reading a book and And perhaps eliminated that time so one of these we can do with when it comes to technologies We can draw boundaries around our use of technology and say okay There are certain times in my day where I'm gonna actually Create a tech-free zone right and that could be the time right before you go to bed and throughout the night Because protecting sleep is vital for your mental health and well-being and we know that when kids in particular a third of adolescents say they're staying Up till midnight or later on weekdays on using their devices and that uses predominantly social media So we can draw those kind of zones another blue zone actually would be around meal times when we're with other people So we can just focus on them and another time would actually be physical activity When we're out you know working out or you know playing a game of pickup soccer or basketball or doing whatever it is that gives us Sort of the chance to be physically active making sure that's also a space where we don't have We're not sort of constantly distracted by by our devices can be helpful, too So there are a lot of there's a lot we can do as individuals But the last thing I'll mention was perhaps one of the most important is We can make sure that we're checking on one another throughout our days And it turns out that there are a lot of people who? Were walking around today who feel invisible who feel alone who even though they're surrounded by lots of people They just feel like they there's no one who really cares about them per se that people are busy with their own lives and that they've become Increasingly invisible and sometimes simply by checking on a co-worker or a classmate or reaching out To a friend not for a particular reason or because you need something But just to say hey, I'm thinking of you want to see how you're doing that can make all the difference in the world Especially at a time where so many people are feeling Invisible and like they don't belong Yeah, so that sounds great. Can I? Challenge some of that a little bit sure so the stuff that you're saying sounds weird to me And like like you just pick like how does that like you say, you know talk to someone for 15 minutes a day Leave your house and go play pick up soccer or pick up basketball Like like I know this sounds kind of like a weird question, but but isn't that weird? How do you actually do that? So I'm glad good. I'm glad you asked so it turns out that it may feel a bit weird because we've become Less accustomed to doing these things like in recent years But the truth is this is actually what we have done for generations And this is actually how we've evolved as human beings over thousands of years is to have face-to-face Interactions with one another to have some frequency of interaction now, you know talking to someone for 15 minutes a day This doesn't have to be hard you could think about a Friend who you haven't talked to in a while or a friend you've talked to often you can think about a family member you can think about a Coworker who you could catch up with maybe over over lunch or just have a conversation with at the beginning or end of the day There are people who are actually pretty close to us are proximate in our lives and sometimes it's literally just a simple phone call You know or a text to them to say hey I'm thinking if you want to know how you're doing that can build a bridge that will feel a lot easier once you've done it Whereas before I know sometimes they can feel like the activation energy to reach out Can be pretty high but the one other interesting thing Is that if you if you're thinking gosh this feels unusual to like reach out and talk to some for 15 minutes a day You're not the only one who feels that the person you're reaching out to may also Be inhibited about reaching out to other people and may not do it But here's interesting I'll tell you is a vast majority of time when you reach out people welcome it It may be unusual, but that actually makes it all the more welcome. I'll give you a simple example I don't know where the last time was a look that maybe you wrote a letter to somebody You know like a physical letter and mailed it to them But it doesn't happen very often anymore right because we just write emails or we send a text message or we we communicate in some other way But whenever you do receive a message I think about the last time you received a letter like from a friend It actually you're like wow this is so unusual this is so interesting like it makes it even more special That you're receiving that and I just recently received a letter from a friend and I don't get letters very often anymore But it was like incredible just to like see the time somebody had actually taken time to write something To me a good friend and it meant like even more to me than it would have like 20 years ago All that just to say that when you reach out to other people even though I might feel a little weird or unusual If you're not used to doing that just know that you will almost always feel better Having done it and the person you reached out to Will feel better too even more so because it's become a more unusual thing for people to do you know in modern life But if I write someone a letter aren't they gonna think I'm weird? Like isn't that a weird thing to do Well, you don't have to write them a letter you can call them if you want But but if you did choose to write them a letter They would probably think it's very unusual But I don't know that they were necessarily but they would I my guess From my own experience is that they would probably be touched that hey you thought enough of them to actually write them a letter So I think you're doing something super cool here, which I think is subtle So I asked you do you think it's weird and you said it's probably unusual And I think even the way that you're talking about it is really interesting because my word choice is loaded with judgment Which I think is actually a huge part of what people nowadays struggle with they're like if I just pick up the phone and call I was thinking about you That can seem creepy like hello Vivek I've been thinking about you you know So yeah, you know it's it's an interesting point I think it's really in how you phrase it But the difference to me between unusual and weird is exactly what you said It's judgment and but the thing is when something is unusual that can actually make it feel more special, right? So like when when I interestingly talk to people out there who have Struggled with loneliness is by the way a lot of people do one in two adults in America report measurable levels of loneliness And it's even higher among young people But when I talk to folks who have received that kind of outreach the unexpected call from a friend or unexpected message from a family member Even when they're a lot of times they're surprised, but they're they're grateful It's like if you walk around feeling like you know what nobody really There's no one seems to really care about me like I disappeared tomorrow No one would even like notice and then someone actually does notice you and they say hey You know you popped in my head the other day. I was just wondering how you're doing wanted to check on you You know wow like I actually matter to somebody you know somebody cared enough about me to reach out So what I want people to know is that at a time where so many people are struggling with their own self-worth with a sense Of loneliness there's that very simple outreach from you can have a powerful impact on them And sometimes we may not realize it because it just seems like I'm just making a phone call to them or writing them a message But it could be a lifeline to people who otherwise are feeling isolated. Yeah, I think that's beautifully said And I think it's it's fascinating how the way you're you use language I think that's what's missing because anytime we think about doing something we attach some kind of judgment to our own actions We think it's weird whereas you're acknowledging. It's not Commonplace but that doesn't necessarily mean it's bad And I think a lot of times people in our community and on the internet We will negotiate against ourselves and think about the worst version of this right like what people will think I'm weird But I think it's spot-on. I think one way to kind of think about it is if someone did this and reached out to you And was like hey, just wondering how you're doing You know that I mean I think people in our community acknowledge that that feels good One other thing if we can bump up the difficulty a little bit. So if someone reaches out to you I think it's reached a point where we don't really know how to respond to those open-ended Authentic desires for connection as opposed to hey, do you want to grab food sometime or you know? Do you want to queue up for a video game? How do you respond if someone like writes you a letter or? Calls you or DMS you without an ulterior motive Yeah, so that's a really good question Because you're right. There's this whole dialogue that goes down in our heads before we think about how to respond right we're thinking One what am I really feeling do I want to share with them? What will they think about me if I share it with them will they tell somebody else if I share it with them like how? I feel by myself if I'm really open with it they're all of these dialogues that are going on in our head before we even utter a word in response and Sometimes that can become complicated and confusing and it can ultimately sometimes result in us saying nothing and just moving past the message Yes, they'll just respond later, right? Here's what I try to do and I've actually I the reason I know this in part is because I've actually felt it Yeah, I've been one of those people who's gotten sometimes those outreaches over the years and Unsure what to say. I just say I'll respond later and then days go by and I never respond right and that's not ideal So what I've defaulted to is just a way to really simplify it Which is it might sound a little scary, but it's actually the to me the simplest thing to do and it helps me actually respond Quickly, which is two words just to be real That's it right so in those moments. I'm trying to go out. What will they think? Well, how they perceive me etc. I just say you know what let me just be real here Let me just be honest about what I'm feeling what I'm doing like what I'm thinking right now And the first time few times I did that I brace myself I was like well What are they gonna respond are they gonna think I'm weird are they not gonna respond which would be perhaps even the worst? Cuz then they maybe think I'm terribly weird so much so that they couldn't write back I'll tell you this every time I realized almost every time when we're real with somebody else What we're doing is we're not just giving ourselves a chance to be authentic which by the way feels good in the long term But we're actually telling the other person hey, it's okay for you to be real, too Is a lot of times that's what people want right if you think about some of the best conversations that we've had in our lives Right there usually conversations where we didn't have to pretend to be someone else we didn't have to put on airs We didn't have to put on fronts right we could just like literally be real be ourselves and not worry the other person was gonna judge For it and we're in one of those moments where we have all built so many layers around us we've become Professional mask wearers, you know we walk around with these masks that are shaped by what we think society wants What we think other people want us to be but Underneath all that is us right and this is a time to actually slowly peel that stuff back and say you know what? There's gonna be real let the chips fall where they may but I'll tell you almost always They fall in a place where people are grateful for the authenticity and encourages them to be open as well Yeah, I loved as you were sort of articulating that internal dialogue It sounds like you're one of us Underneath everything which is awesome and and chat by the way is loving everything you're saying and I think it's it's impactful in a different Way because I think when we think about you we think about like this. This is not a regular human being This is the Surgeon General of the United States and they hear that And I'll tell you one other thing I looked at You know, I I'm an introvert, you know, some of the folks on here may be introverts as well But I'm also a shy introvert right so like growing up Let me tell you that was particularly tough because you know, there were times I wanted to like make friends hang out You know play ball with other kids etc But at a hard time sort of figuring out how to start a conversation or kind of get going I was always worried people gonna maybe think poorly of me or judge me or I'd say the wrong thing and so I would I would think a lot, you know internally before I said anything and would overthink things a lot and Let's tell you it was really exhausting It was really exhausting and it led to a lonely experience because I wasn't reaching out and making the kind of friendships that I really wanted To make and it took me a long time to to kind of get over that to realize that What felt like a really risky move which is just being myself and just saying what was on my mind That That actually turned out was the better path, you know It felt a scary initially but it felt so much better like in the in the long term and it actually helped me actually reach out and connect other people and Then I would realize that they were feeling the same way in fact years after I was in grade school, I reconnected with a bunch of friends from there and And they all told me something where it's very interesting because I was looking at their lives when I was in school thinking wow These guys seem to have it all together. They seem to be hanging out with other people. They're in great time I'm the only one who's like sort of shy and an introverted and having a hard time connecting But they all told me to a tee They're like, you know, we felt the same way too that we were having a hard time connecting We felt weird we felt isolated and awkward. I was like I had no idea that these other people were feeling the same way so the bottom line is like if you're out there feeling like Sometimes it's hard to connect or feeling like you're having a whole internal dialogue That's like paralyzing you from acting and reaching out to other people just no, you're not alone There are a lot of people who are struggling with this But this is like the power of moments where we can be real is that we can break that cycle We can short-circuit those thoughts that are like, you know cycling through our head And we can have a genuine human interaction and I'll just tell you when that's an act of courage an acts of courage Give other people the courage to act as well Yeah, that's so fascinating. Can I ask you more about this? Yeah, so so I totally get that long term, right? You've learned the lesson That reaching out can be initially scary but that over time it you form connections with people. It's great Fantastic, but in that initial stuff you said it took you a long time and that's where I imagine actually most of our audiences now They're not in the later stages. They're in the oh my god. This is terrifying. Do you remember? what you're like Almost like minute process when you were working on this like what what could you do to actually make it easier on yourself? Yeah, it's a good question So a couple things I say one is The time that it was hardest for me was in building up to actually reaching out But the time where it started to feel better Was about Probably 15 to 20 seconds into like their response Because I realized after that that I had opened the door and that someone else was walking through it That it wasn't just like an old minute and there's no one there people ran the other way But it only took 15 or 20 seconds, right? Because you're putting something out and then you're waiting for a response But a couple things that I found to be helpful and this is actually some interesting research behind this as well Which is that if you? picture If you assume that the other person is gonna have a positive response to you that actually Changes how you show up in the conversation so if you and I are meeting for the first time a local we just did a few minutes ago and If I assume that a local is going to like me, right? then that actually turns out makes me warmer in my interactions toward you and that warmth is Perceived by the other person and increases the likelihood that they will like me and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy And so there's some interesting research behind that but like so one of things I try to do is If I'm feeling nervous about an interaction right whether it's an interaction at work or with a you know But somebody socially or whatever might be I just sort of pause for a minute to take a deep breath and then picture Them enjoying my company, you know and and and liking our conversation and it turns out that changes how I behave the other thing that I try to remind myself of And when I do feel some trepidation about reaching out is that sure to remember my history I try to remember the instances where I did actually reach out right even when it felt weird or felt awkward And I try to remember how that felt right so speaking of Unusual you know practices. I'll tell you about something that I did in medical school, which was unusual So I mentioned I was just shy and introverted growing up That was throughout grade schools throughout college and it was into like the beginning of medical school But I was starting med school I remember and I was on a hundred classmates right all people I had never met before I was like excited to be part of the Community but I was like I'm not like typically the kind of person who like goes to big raging parties and like meets people there And like you know and goes to clubs and like makes a little you know best friends like that Just doesn't feel like the right a family, you know comfortable environment for me I was more comfortable which one-on-one or small group conversation. So here's what I decided to do I said, you know I'm gonna use my time that I have for lunch and dinner when we're a lot of us are in the cafeteria together I'm saying to ask somebody who I'm interested in if they want to have lunch and I just have like a one-on-one Conversation with them over lunch and if you think about it like that can seem like a bit of a unusual or scary thing to do right like You know everyone's like hanging out the cafeteria you're asking somebody to like, you know Just get together and have lunch one-on-one and I would do like, you know, very simply like after a lecture or something You know if I was sitting next to somebody and I actually was having a little combo or I thought hey this interesting person I'd love to chat with them. I just say hey, you know I'm gonna be having lunch in the cafeteria later today or tomorrow. Do you want to get you want to get a bite together? You know, we'd love to chat and and you know almost In fact, I can't think of an instance where someone said no, but here's the interesting thing. I try to remember those conversations Were some of the best conversations I had in my five years in graduate school I made friends through those conversations because we the doors open we got to know each other friends Who've like remained dear friends to this day and even though it seemed like an unusual thing a couple months into that. I Started getting complaints from people who said how come you haven't asked me yet You know to come and have lunch or dinner one-on-one When is my turn and it was one of those moments when I realized that I wasn't the only one craving connection There were a lot of other people craving it as well But I was blind to that so I try to remember my past also and think it even though sometimes I might feel scared to Reach out the moments where I've been courageous enough to do it in the past It's led to amazing experiences and great friendships and it reminds me that hey a lot of us are in this boat of wanting to Connect more deeply So here's what I'm kind of hearing So I think it's really interesting because I think there's a sophisticated process going on So there's a there's first of all you align behind a central goal of being authentic, right? so once you have kind of like a Sort of abstract goal. It kind of recruits different parts of your brain to move towards it I think you also have you're very careful with your phrasing because Even the way that you reached out to people to lunch I think is something that we're sort of losing in the day of like emojis Which is? Hey, I'm gonna grab lunch. Would you like me to join me? You know, I'd love to chat like it's it's very low pressure low stakes opens the door for people and I think sometimes people don't You know know quite how to say that so I think there's actually a lot of sophistication and then the next thing is Your attitude So I think you actually do some interesting Cognitive things about removing judgment from the equation weird versus unusual You really kind of look at things objectively and the last thing is that you actually do a really good job of post-processing where you reflect back on things and you actually like really solidify your wins And and it's fascinating because even in 15 minutes, I mean to hear you come from where you are to where you are today I think there's a lot that people can learn about just like this process. It's really interesting
