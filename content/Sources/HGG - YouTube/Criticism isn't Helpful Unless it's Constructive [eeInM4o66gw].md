 So if someone comes to you and says, hey, you're screwing up at work. And then you say, okay, in what way? What should I do about it? That kind of criticism isn't actually helpful unless it's constructive. And what does constructive mean? That means that when someone comes to you and points out something that you're doing wrong, they also point out some kind of corrective action. Now, in some way, this is unfair on the kid because the whole point of the parent-child relationship is that the child should not be responsible for parenting the parent and telling them how to do better. That's actually the parent's responsibility. And the truth of the matter is that's just unfair to y'all, but this is unfortunately what it sort of means to have a parent-child relationship, is that on some level, you're gonna have to accept some responsibility for guiding them and sharing with them what you're looking for.
