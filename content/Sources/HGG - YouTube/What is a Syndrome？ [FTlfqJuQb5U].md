 So syndrome is a constellation of symptoms that people share, right? So it's like a group of things that we group together. And then the cool thing about the syndrome is that once we recognize what a syndrome is—so major depressive disorder is a syndrome, ADHD is a syndrome—it's a constellation of things that go together. And when we call something a syndrome, the reason that's useful is if we can lump these things together and it's a pattern that lots of different people can relate to, then we can study this group of people because we're putting these people together because they share a constellation of symptoms, and then we can understand how can we help this group of people.
