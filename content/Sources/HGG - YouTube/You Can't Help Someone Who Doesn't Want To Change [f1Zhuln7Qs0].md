 When people say, I wish this would work, or sometimes they will literally not, is that they don't want to change. And then there's nothing you can do. And that's the problem, right? It's not about capability, it's not about mental illness. I literally, my day job is working with people with mental illness. They are capable of so much. The difference is whether they want to change. And so the last thing that I would say, even if you're in a situation where this doesn't work, is give it a shot and don't lose heart. Because if someone doesn't want to change, they won't change. But you will come out of this better. Because even though they don't want to change, you will have practiced this. And one day you will meet someone who will want to change. And when they want to change, you will have the skill set to help them get there and create a healthy relationship. And this will mean the world in your life. Because then what will happen is over time you will start separating people. Who is willing to play ball? Who is willing to communicate? Who is willing to change their, what they're doing? Change their strategy? And who is not willing to?
