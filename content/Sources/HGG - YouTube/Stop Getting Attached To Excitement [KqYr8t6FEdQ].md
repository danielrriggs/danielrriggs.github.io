 Do you want to live your life with all these worries in your head? Oh my god, what if she says this? And what if I confess all my feelings? And what if she doesn't like it? Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Just chill the fuck out, man. Like, look, if she doesn't like it, she doesn't like it. If he doesn't like it, he doesn't like it. You are going to be tranquil up here, right? So you have some feelings. Hey, I've got this feeling like it's like this cup of water. And like, maybe I can drink from it. That's how it should be, right? You want this job, you can tell people, hey, I'm really interested in this job. I'm excited about it for this, this, and this reason. The problem is when we let our excitement become an attachment. The problem is when we start planning around something that hasn't happened yet. So let go of the attachment. Let go of everything you attach to this interaction. Your self-worth as a man. Oh my god, she won't talk to me. This one person rejected me and now I don't feel like a man. That's okay. One person rejected you. There are a thousand reasons why people reject other people that have nothing to do with you. Biggest mistake that we make in our society is we take rejections personally. And the reason we do that is because some people try to make it personal.
