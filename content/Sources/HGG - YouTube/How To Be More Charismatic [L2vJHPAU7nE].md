 So the main thing that we can do to boost our charisma is to be more authentic. So if we sort of think about, let's say, things that are naturally attractive. So let's say like there's a campfire, okay? And if you sort of think about a campfire, it's very inviting, right? It's like warm, it's cheery, it's crackly, it looks cool, it's like fire, bro! And it's also like it feels good to like sit next to it, right? So we're sort of naturally attracted to campfires. So how do we have other people be naturally drawn towards us? We have to be authentic. And why is that? It's because when people can't trust us, they will not be attracted to us. And at the same time, the more that you can develop that authenticity, the more people will be drawn towards you, right? Because they know what they're gonna get. And the primary concern that so many people have in the world right now is that you can't trust people. So if you are one of the people that people can actually trust, that's gonna be a huge chunk of charisma.
