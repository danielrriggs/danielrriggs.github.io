 What causes exhaustion when we socially interact with people? There's one primary variable that you can control, which is the purpose of the social interaction. So purpose-driven social interaction reduces the energy drain. So when I go to a party because my friends are like, hey, put yourself out there. And you're like, all right, I guess I have to go to a party. And then you go to a party, but you're like, OK, I'm just here to put myself out there. There's not a clear idea of like what you're doing there. There's not a clear purpose. That's going to be socially exhausting because you're just sitting there, you're holding a drink, maybe you're on your phone too. You're kind of like, what am I even doing here? Like, this is a pain. Like, no one's talking to me. I'm not talking to anyone. You're not really like focused on you don't have a particular goal. So this is what's really interesting is you can send introverts to social situations or extroverts. And if they have a purpose for being there, their energy will will be way higher.
