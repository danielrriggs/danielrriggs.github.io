 how do I stay out of the friend zone? It's not expressing your feelings that's the problem. It's what is the formation of this relationship looking like? How do you start to form these relationships? Do you start these relationships in a platonic way? Do you start these relationships in a professional way? Or do you start these relationships in a romantic way? And for a lot of people who get friend zoned, they usually don't start them off romantically, right? They usually start them off platonically. And so you're setting an expectation. If you're struggling with ADHD and you're having problems in terms of organizing, prioritizing, if you're struggling to like communicate with your partner, it comes down to really sitting down and setting good expectations. It's like thinking through stuff ahead of time and trying to externalize as much of it as you can. Because if you try to hold it in your head, that may work for neurotypical people, they may be able to hold a lot of crap in their head. But like the second you get distracted, it all gets disorganized. Then you have to start over from square one. And then over time stuff piles up. The more stuff piles up, the more overwhelmed you get. Now you have to even hold more stuff in your head.
