 So first we've got to understand that a panic attack is an over activation of our sympathetic nervous system, which is our like survival mechanisms. So our body is going to be filled with adrenaline. It's going to be filled with cortisol. Our heart rate is going to be through the roof. Our blood pressure is going to be super high. Our respiratory rate is going to be very high. We're going to be breathing very, very rapidly. Respiration or breathing is a two way street. If you feel a certain way, it will change your breathing. So if I breathe like this, that's like an angry pattern of breathing. And if I keep breathing like that, there are actually studies that show that people were sort of like experimenting with this stuff and researchers would breathe that way. And then they would start to feel angry, even if they weren't upset about anything. So your breathing can control your emotions. So that's why we really recommend slow deep breaths. And actually exhalation is more important than inhalation. So you really want to extend out that exhalation as much as possible.
