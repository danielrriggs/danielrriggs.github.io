 But there's a really interesting feature of the brain. When we are highly emotional, our emotions hijack our logic. So if you look at a political debate, these people are emotionally charged and they're both convinced that they're logically correct 100% of the time. And the more emotionally charged the debate becomes, the more sure someone is that they're thinking logical. You may have engaged in arguments with people where the person that you're arguing with is really, really emotional and not thinking clearly, but if you ask them, their perception is that they are perfectly logical. And let's be fair, if you're arguing you're probably emotional and you're probably thinking that I am 100% right and they are 100% wrong. So we have to understand this really key relationship between emotions and analysis, which is that the more emotional we are, the more likely we are to actually hijack our analytical circuitry. And then the emotions are actually in control and they're pulling the strings of our logic. And we absolutely see this in depression as well.
