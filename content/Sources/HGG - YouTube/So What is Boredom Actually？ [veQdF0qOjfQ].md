 So what is boredom actually? Boredom is a stimulation seeking emotional state. So our mind has figured out, hey, if we're not getting the stimulation that we want, what I'm going to do is make this person feel bored. And once they start to feel bored, we are going to seek some kind of external stimulation, which will then relieve the boredom. Furthermore, if we're getting stimulated from the outside, what we're going to be doing is suppressing all of our internal signals. And this is where if you want to start listening to your internal voice, what you actually need to do is stop drowning it out from the outside. So the thoughts in our mind come from two places. They can either come from our sensory organs or something like internally memory or things like that. So if you kind of think about, you know, what are you excited about today? Are you excited about seeing a particular movie or playing a particular game or eating a particular food? How did you have that excitement? Where did that thought come from? Chances are it came from a sensory organ. And as long as we are being bombarded by the sensory organs, it's going to be very hard for our internal thoughts to actually arise.
