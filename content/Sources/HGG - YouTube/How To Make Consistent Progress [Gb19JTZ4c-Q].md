 If you want to get good at something, instead of just getting excited because you saw someone else do it, or instead of just doing it because you feel like doing it, the first thing you should do is really ask yourself, what about this is important to me? And there are a couple of really interesting ways that you can apply it. And the second thing that I want you all to do is when you start doing the task, there are going to be times where you don't want to do it. And then ask yourself two questions. Question number one is what is more important to me right now? Is it more important to actually go out and try to make friends because this is what I care about? Or is it more important to me to give into the social anxiety and not put myself through the discomfort? And the second thing that you can ask yourself is tomorrow, which choice will lead to pride and which choice will lead to regret? And then give yourself the option to say, OK, I want to be proud of myself tomorrow. That's important to me. Making progress is important. And as you actually move in that direction, you'll discover that leaning towards your values allows you to actually make consistent progress towards something.
