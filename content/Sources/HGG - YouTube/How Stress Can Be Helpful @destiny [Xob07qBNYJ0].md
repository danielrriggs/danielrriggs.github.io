 Have you ever heard of the phrases or the term stress versus you stress? Yeah. Yeah. I think it's kind of like that. It's the idea that it took me a long time to figure out why stress was such a motivating factor for me, but it's always because I felt like when I'm confronted with a stressful thing, it's like a challenge and I felt like I've got the tools to overcome it for whatever reason. So these things end up becoming, you know, like an impetus for me to either improve or succeed. But for a lot of people that feel like they don't have those tools, those types of stressful things just become kind of a horrifying pit of despair that they feel like they can't do anything about. And they just kind of like, you know, put their head down and they have, they have no way to like work their way through it. So just to kind of take a step back, we sort of know if you look at like scientific studies of the flow state, if the challenges that you face are too easy, you will get bored. If the challenges that you face are overwhelming, you will get overwhelmed. The top end of the challenge curve and at the bottom end of the challenge curve, both of those cause a decrease in performance. And in that middle zone, that is the zone of you stress where you're kind of challenged sufficiently to where you actually perform the best.
