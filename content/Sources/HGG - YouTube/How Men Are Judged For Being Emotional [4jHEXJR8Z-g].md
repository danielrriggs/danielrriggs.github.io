 But if you really look at how we judge men for getting in touch with their emotions, it's not very good. And you may say, no, Dr. K, like, no, we're like totally fine accepting men's emotions. No, we are not. We are okay accepting one emotion from men, which is sadness. Now, thankfully, in the last 30 years, it's okay for a dude to cry. But do we accept a man's anger? No. That's what we call toxic masculinity. Men are allowed to feel emotions except for anger, because when you feel anger, you're a toxic man. Toxic masculinity, bad man for feeling anger. You should be crying instead. How dare you get upset? What about shame? Oh, as a man, I feel pathetic. I don't know if this is ever going to work out. I'm so sorry. Oh, my God, this guy is so emotionally needy. I can't handle this. It's not my responsibility to patch up this man. And the crazy thing is, you're not wrong there, right? If that's what you're saying, it isn't your responsibility. No single human being is responsible for fixing another human being.
