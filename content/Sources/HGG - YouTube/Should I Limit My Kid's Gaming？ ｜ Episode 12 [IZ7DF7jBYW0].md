 I don't actually recommend an hour limit because I think each kid is different, I think each family is different. There's a huge difference between a 12 year old and a 15 year old and a 17 year old and a 21 year old. So what I say is first of all talk to your kids, right? And like the first thing that you've got to do is disarm because when you talk to them about video games, the first thing that pops into their mind is you're going to take my games away. So anything that they tell you is going to be me plus the game against you. So I think the first thing that you've got to do is try to get on their team, right? Try to really explain to them that I want to talk to you, I'm not saying we're going to make any, and I know this is a warranty, I'm not saying we're making any changes, first just help me understand. And then I think you should set reasonable expectations. So here's like dialogue that I would say, I'd say like you know I know that you really love playing Fortnite because you feel amazing when you win a game and that's like really awesome for you to win. And I want you to feel that way too. I'm just wondering if there are other alternatives in addition to Fortnite that could help you feel that way. Also, I know that you really love Fortnite but I think that your grades are kind of unacceptable. I know you're capable of getting more VCs. And so if your grades don't improve then we're going to have to stop playing Fortnite.
