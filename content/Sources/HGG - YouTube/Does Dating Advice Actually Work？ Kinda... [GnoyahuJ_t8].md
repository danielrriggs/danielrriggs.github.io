 Okay, all this crap about finding a romantic partner, does it actually work? So here's the answer. Yes, it works. It just takes a really long time. Honestly, it's like opening a loot box. That's what dating is. I don't know exactly what the odds are. There are certain things you can do to improve the odds. But at the end of the day, the only guaranteed way to get the item is to keep opening loot boxes. I don't know what the odds are. I wish I could tell you. But in my experience, if you have like no social skills whatsoever and you're like going nowhere in life, give it at least five years. And for those of you are saying, I can't do this for five years. That sounds depressing. Like, I don't know what else to tell you. Give yourself five years to grow into a human being that someone else would want to date. Work on your social skills, get financially independent, get into shape physically, take care of your mental. Like this stuff takes time. The other thing is I don't actually think it's going to take five years. But here's the magical thing. If you give yourself five years, you won't expect anything in two years. When you're not expecting it is when it's the most likely to happen.
