 Just a heads up that there are only about a hundred spots left for the first session on us program that we're doing in our coaching program. So if y'all are interested, maybe somewhere between a hundred and two hundred spots left. So if y'all are interested, I would strongly, strongly encourage you to sign up like soonish or nowish because it'll probably be gone in a couple of days or so, I would imagine, at the rate that they're going. So if y'all are interested in trying out coaching and are curious about what it can do for you, first session's on us right now and it'll probably end within a couple of days or as soon as those spots fill up.
