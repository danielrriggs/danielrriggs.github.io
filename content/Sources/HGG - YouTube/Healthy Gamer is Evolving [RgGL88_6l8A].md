another healthy gamer gg stream my name is alok canoja just a reminder that although i'm a psychiatrist nothing we discussed on stream today is intended to be taken as medical advice everything is for educational entertainment purposes only if y'all have a concern or question please go see a licensed professional so welcome everyone so we are doing a update stream today our esteemed ceo will be joining us in about five to ten minutes so i think we're going to wait for her to like get started get started so i'll tell you all a little bit about why we're doing this and then if y'all are cool with it maybe we can just hang out for a little while while we wait for her um so yeah i think how can i how can i get this started so like this was never supposed to be what it is today like in a good way right so when we started healthy gamer it was like it wasn't even like we picked a name or anything right it was like hey i'm gonna start streaming and then at the time i had someone who helped me set up the stream and we had to like register an account so when i registered an account i was like let's do healthy gamer i don't know and then that one was taken so i was like okay healthy gamer.com is on auction for like a million dollars so let's be gamers and add a .gg to it right and so like that's how we got started and and so we started i mean i started streaming because literally like i was just having the same conversations with the gamers in my office all the time and i was like okay a lot of what people need is not actually psychotherapy or medications it's like an understanding education around how technology affects them how games affect them and that's kind of where we got started and then i think the other thing is that early on like as we had ideas we shared them with you and i think Ruthie will talk a little bit more about this um but i don't know if you all remember but like four years ago or something like that we had a fundraiser for to develop a coaching program that was community funded and so like we had like and we'll get to this more but you know so we sort of had these ideas like Dr. K had an idea and it was like okay let's see if we can do this together as a community let's see if we can do it and then i think something that's changed a lot over the last year is that there's a lot of internal decision making which i guess we don't we don't talk about quite as much and there are reasons for that so one of the early things that we realized when we had a very small team so i think we hired our first full-time employee in April of 2020 and like you know eight months in or maybe into 2021 we had a small team of like four or five people and then sometimes i would have an idea on stream and if you all participated in our high performance high potential groups and y'all were there at the beginning you kind of know what i mean so i was like dr k was like okay you know what we need to do like there's all these people who struggle with like i have high potential like i don't know what how to do with it i don't know what to do and i was like okay let's start a group right like let's start like working on this let's meet on a regular basis and we'll have coaches that help them with this kind of stuff and then after like one or two weeks of the group starting we decided we're going to split people into two groups high performance and high potential and then the first question that everyone had after like one or two weeks is like how do you tell the difference between someone who's high potential and someone who's high performance and then in my mind i was kind of like well if you've accomplished something then you're high performance and if you haven't accomplished anything yet you're high potential if you're like a college student who's like you know in an honors program at a prestigious university that's like high potential and but then we quickly realized like this is silly right because what if you're like two years out and like you still haven't accomplished a whole lot but you have a lot of potential you're one of the up-and-comers that you're at your you know like job or whatever so the group had the groups had all kinds of problems we learned a lot and we developed it actually eventually into something like career coaching which has been very successful so it's all useful but like we would sort of start with half-baked ideas and then like develop it as we go and i think thankfully the community was very very like understanding with this kind of approach the problem is at some point we stopped being just a straight like duct tape and glue kind of operation right at some point like you know we have a team over 150 people including coaches and employees at this point and like you know we're have over a couple million subs on youtube and and 700 000 subs on twitch or followers on twitch and like we're like a real thing now right so we're like got nominated for awards at various places got featured as a digital innovator or mental health innovator at the american psychiatric association so then like at some point like we became a real thing and then at that point it doesn't work like we can't just be like oh yeah we built this thing i'm sorry it doesn't work and i think this by the way is like crazy if you really stop and think about it right so we have so many well established companies like triple a companies that up that put out products at huge price tags like 70 dollars for a triple a game 80 dollars for a triple a game plus microtransaction bullshittery and it's broken at launch and like we had shit that was broken at launch like four years ago but even today with our you know somewhat upgraded duct tape and shoe string and glue kind of like stuff like we put out good products and we get good feedback right and so i think it's crazy so like i think we've got a lean mean team that is really really awesome we've got a community that's super awesome and i think part of what we're going to do today is because the other thing that made it easier for us to share more about what we were doing is it was like dr k is going to think out loud on stream but at this point we have people who are we've got a team of developers and we've got product a product lead and we've got like marketing people and we have like a ceo and a cfo so like now the building in public doesn't quite work the same way because there are people who are actually building it the right way which is part of part of the part of what makes our products great and also part of what like makes hg feel a little bit different and so today i think the goal is just to talk to you all about what we're doing why we're doing it and what we hope to do and i think we did this some when we launched memberships which i think some people had concerns about which is fair enough we'll get into all of that so we're going to be like very transparent today or i i think we're going to be very transparent we'll see whether you all consider it transparent or not but you know our goal is to really show you all and i think some of it is not just this is what we were thinking but i think a lot of times i didn't understand this either so when we started out when i started out before it was a we right so like it was easy to do things for hg because the only cost was my time so i would like literally i would work three 12 hour days in my clinic and then i would devote two two days to hg so i would like work a whole week and then yeah i have a chair you can take this one actually because the mic is still set up in a way that it really only picks up one person why don't you sit down here for a second i'm going to finish my thought and then you can take over and i can help you drive but like at the beginning the cost was only my time and then also it was like what was our primary product our primary product was just stream so that's pretty simple right we just need like some kind of camera i remember i streamed on a yeti mic right so like we had like a i had like an 80 camera and like a 150 microphone and that was it that's all we needed and then i had my gaming pc obviously right which my work pc and and that's all it took but now i think as as we'll show you all today hopefully that there's a lot more that goes into it and then i also did not appreciate you know like how expensive things are to actually build the right way and what we hope to do today is to show you all what we're what we're how we got to where we are what we're proud of what we're grateful to you all for because we literally could not be here without you and also why we choose why we made some of the choices that we made and what what some of the options are we also want to show you all a little bit more about behind the scenes what it takes to build what we have built so far and i'm gonna actually turn things over to groothy who's sitting outside of frame but that's okay and i will be sitting next door or not next door i'll be sitting right here but i think you should swap because this mic setup we gotta figure out maybe a two mic setup at some point sit and where you tell me bebs do you need water i do hey guys i'm straight out of shower um how's everybody doing if you need to do anything with windows and stuff tell me i will do it i need to touch anything just feet okay hold on ah how's everybody doing um all right i'm gonna just get a little oriented here because i don't like talking into the void so i want to make chat bigger and myself smaller okay y'all are going so fast okay um usually i need like a face to talk to i don't do well with i don't do well with anyway um it's been a while since i've gotten to hang out with you guys and i am realizing that we haven't given any updates on what we're doing why we're doing it what we're building so today i wanted to really connect with you guys and get your thoughts and opinions on what we're kind of trying to accomplish here what we're building i think it's been kind of fun because you know we've made a couple of decisions right like alok was okay i'm gonna quit medicine to do this and at the same time he was like but if i do this i don't want to be somebody who's just selling courses or doing speaking events he really liked the impact part doing speaking events he really liked the impact part um so then we kind of made the decision okay if we're going to build something let's build it let's make it high integrity let's make it sustainable let's make it something that he would feel proud to recommend to somebody and so we started with this coaching program um way back in the day there was i don't know on a good day it was like 100 ccv stream and this was pre-pandemic right so there wasn't there wasn't such a dramatic need there were people starting to think like oh i really could be doing more for my mental health and so we built a coaching program for you know the hundred or so folks that were showing up and also by the way none of this was supposed to work it was an experiment like let's see if we can do this but of course as always alok knocked it out of the park it went really well and then everything just kind of blew up and so we said okay how do we keep this integrity and do it at scale and that's kind of where our coaching is alok i am really struggling with how unsymmetrical i am on your camera um you're not unsymmetrical there you're i'm just unsymmetrical no you're unsymmetrical because you know it looks like this and it's an angle the camera is angled slightly that's why you look weird let's scoot you over here i can't even tell why don't look at don't look at yourself well i can't do this whole stream with one eyebrow that much higher than the other one okay you want to go fix them just don't worry about it just we're not here for vanity i know that's why i'm trying to make okay listen you had your face blown up i made it that's because i'm so much more narcissistic than you are okay you don't want to hear something fun how do it no i don't want the whole chapter how do i just can you find chapter one for me so i can play it for them all right listen if i get really unsymmetrical asymmetrical for you just let me know otherwise it's going to be a long hour or so okay anyway so we started building things at scale and the coaching program was such a hit that we really wanted to continue building on kind of the depth but also the breadth so we wanted to get how do i say this the quality was so high but then the pandemic hit and so many people needed help so we built really fast and really aggressively so we wanted to make sure that through all that building the integrity really really stayed true and i think we were able to accomplish that i want to share the impact report with you guys volume is a bit low yeah you need to sit closer to the microphone okay this is a problem that we still haven't been able to figure out this is i don't know i can get more close to this yeah just get this microphone is almost in my mouth okay that's where so you just said excuse you i will position this all right no don't move back okay okay let's try this again all we're trying to do i think today is make sure that everybody understands what we're trying to do and tell us if you guys want to see something else from us and i want to make sure that kind of expectations meet reality i think there are i think this is a pretty small minority but it's still something we're sensitive to right where there's like kind of outsized unrealistic expectations of what basically the two of us can pull together we have been really really fortunate i think that the healthy gamer team is a i got an email because we just had our 21st hire for healthy gamer and it's really cool to see everything grow so big like i used to meet every person that we hired i used to meet every i was in on every decision and now you know we're lucky enough to really have a whole scaled up system and infrastructure around mental health resources that we've built for you guys but the real point here is that it's for you so if this is not what you want we are open to hearing what it is that you want with the coaching program we and that's like you know across all of our content revenue all of our enterprise revenue all of the coaching revenue all of the memberships all of that about 70 percent of that goes into maintaining the quality and integrity of the coaching program it's so important to us that if people are coming in for that kind of experience that they're really getting the best that they can so anyway that's kind of our guiding light is to build for and with this community and i wanted to share with you guys some of our plans some of the things that we're working on i think you're gonna love most of it i think you're gonna have concerns about some of it so i want to kind of talk through all of it um all right i agree dr k looks great with long hair oh i also wanted to share with you have y'all heard i'm listening to alex audiobook right now like which is really not great for a marriage but oh i just want to play this part for you okay this is audible penguin random house audio presents how to raise a healthy gamer and power struggles break bad screen habits and transform your relationship with your kids this is the author alok kanogia md mph okay that's all i was just really proud when i heard that all right so i think people are done with the disclaimers let's get into it let's get into it um so what do you want to you want to start with what let's go with the impact report okay i think we can just link it in chat right yeah yeah well we can just show it real quick show it i'll do this oh i want to see you come over here are you reading research articles right now yes for a moment okay um it's gonna be hard no this is not gonna work this you have no idea i tried i tried to get this chair to work it didn't work usually get the midget chair i know yeah i got the midget chair this time i'm the midget today why are you because we don't i don't know how to do this i tried for like five minutes and then okay so let's we don't have to go through the whole because i think we showed this yesterday but i think just say say what you want to say about well i just want to send them the link honestly okay we'll just share real quick go ahead say what you want to about the impact report i mean honestly i want to i want to know um i want to answer questions i think the impact report is fairly explanatory um to me the really cool part about all of this is we the coaching program to date has seen 16 000 people go through it and it still has like a 4.8 out of five star rating which to me is crazy and we have clients in like 140 something countries and territories so that's been awesome i think just people things that have been built people are making things um okay why don't we just okay let's just okay can i can i take it all right so this is going to be okay let's swap you see if you can figure out how to get this chair to to raise oh my god okay musical chairs okay so we chat chat all right so what are we talking about so a couple of things about where we started i i saw some stuff on on chat yeah yeah we're i think we're gonna we're gonna get to that so i just want to talk a little bit about like why we built what we built so far and what we want to build going forward so the first thing is uh this just to give you all a quick timeline right so we tried a lot of different stuff at hg so we tried first of all streaming here's the problem with streaming is that we got the same questions over and over and over again and that there's not a library of content so one of the challenges that we had to face was like okay how do we get how can we make something that's like almost like a curriculum where if someone shows up later um and then says uh you know oh like has dr k ever talked about this and for a long time oh god um so for for a long time people would be like oh is like has dr k talked about this kind of stuff before and then let me see okay um so so if dr k has talked about this and then what what used to happen which is great right is people in our community would like sift through our content and say oh yeah there's a lecture on this or maybe this other resource from like another mental health creator or this book is fantastic so we were very very like community driven which is fantastic the problem is that like y'all as community members don't have the quite the same resources at helping each other out as we have as an organization so this past year tech teller who's an absolute boss by the way has been with us early early early on right so discovered us on the internet um built these resource packs and so the goal of resource packs is to give people like you know like various oh okay you have to be signed in so a lot of these are various lectures that we've done all over the place and then they have different kinds of um like reflections and videos and exercises and stuff like that so we built uh um we built these resource packs right so these were also like a kind of a fair lift from a product development side like this design and stuff like these look gorgeous and these are not like these are not these take some time and energy to build um we talked about impact report so so we started to organize our content we also did a couple of things which i'm sure you all noticed which is that we started to make content that was not live streams so what we sort of discovered is that when we live stream stuff there's some stuff that works really well on live stream but sometimes people want like very like a to the point 20 minute or 30 minute video and that really encapsulates a concept so we built that and then some people were happy about that and some people were not happy about that right so a lot of people who were with us at the beginning were like this stuff seems less depth than the other stuff we liked the depth that dr k used to provide and that's where we basically ran into a couple of problems and the first problem is that we grew so then we had a core problem of like okay as we grow what's the goal for like making what people want right because this is where there's like different subsets of people at hg and different people want different things um so we started to switch over or not switch over but we started to do standalone content that would get uploaded to youtube but we still continued to stream and then like recently for example a lot of people will ask about things like interviews and stuff i hope to get back to weigh more interviews especially community interviews in the summer probably is when it's going to happen and the reason for that is also because we grew and this isn't like oh we grew therefore we're leaving this shit behind this is a okay let's think about mission for a second like what are we doing here right what's the goal the goal is to try to help as many people as possible with their mental health and so we have a choice like we always have a choice so recently i went on a podcast called diary of a ceo and the podcast was from a metrics perspective very successful there were a couple of clips that went viral and then there was a whole discussion that started to happen around like suicidality and especially men's mental health so what i just want you all to like think about for a second is that our our choice is very simple right so we i have a choice on any given day so for diary of a ceo i had to literally travel to a different city right so it's like for three days being on that podcast costs three days of time so over the course of let's say like 50 weeks a year right if i'm working six days that's like it's one percent of my yearly time goes to diary of a ceo so in that when i choose to do that what that means is that i sacrifice two stream days and then the question is like what's is it worth it i don't know right we still actually don't know so generally speaking what we found is that being a guest in other places is good in a lot of ways we had this book come out so we had to like go to different places and we went to nbc and things like that and that was all great but it's like once again we're trying to help as many people as possible but the problem is that when we do that we have to make sacrifices somewhere else and especially if you know the main muscle behind hg is dr k then that's a very very limited resource which is part of the reason why we started doing things like made a coaching program and literally the reason that i made a coaching program is because i was getting like 5 000 requests a month in my private practice and i was like there's no way i can see all these people so can i teach people to do what i do in some way and there's a lot of evidence about peer support and stuff like that in favor of united nations and world health organization and office of the u.s surgeon general everyone says peer support is fantastic i had seen that as an addiction psychiatrist working at a couple of rehabs so we were like okay let's build a peer support program for us for our generation this is not a it's not an adaptation of a you know there's certain problems with a in my opinion and many people doesn't work well for them it's a fantastic program overall and i i'm a big fan of it but let's build something from the ground up for us and i think if i had to say like what are we about that's the mission statement let's build something from the ground up for us so then came dr k's guide which is people wanted a lot of depth the problem once again with online content is that there's a short attention span and people are coming in and out and so we wanted to create a linear experience that is like a mastery of a particular topic so oftentimes like i was just seeing you know like i was reading some youtube comments from a video i can show you literally what i'm talking about i'll screen share this in a second so i was looking at comments like this and in these kinds of comments is what what made us make the guide hold on a second quiet you um so like i'm just going to show you all just one comment from a lecture we had right so uh so people would say stuff like this is not unusual by the way okay so this person is saying my god now i understand why i never paid attention in school i literally cannot get enough of these lectures it genuinely feels like i'm listening to living life 101 so many basic concepts i just completely missed the boat on imagine if something like this was taught in schools the benefit for children would be incredible so we we got this kind of feedback early on and so when i made the guide the goal was to make a not living life 101 but a like depression 101 or anxiety 101 or meditation 101 and let's like turn it into something that is oh let's turn it into something that is like really really in depth now the challenge is that when we do something like that it's not cheap right so this is this is where we're going to get to a couple of different things um what yes okay so you gotta gotta move up can't sit like that okay gotta move all the way up all right can we just okay so oh what um let's let's show them so i think what we want to do is just show you all a couple of things that wait where is the we want to show you all just a couple of things before um uh what should we start with i think i just want to quickly see um any questions so far you gotta speak up and into the mic okay but i can't see anything with it right there my god um any questions so far my name is cruthey kanodja i'm mrs k in chat i'm miss cruthey i am the co-founder of healthy gamer um and i run all of the operations and the ceo so yeah so just to give you all an example um so here's just to give you all a sense so i think sometimes people i don't know how many of you all are familiar with content creation but so for example like for content this is assuming two to three lectures or videos per week okay so lectures or videos per week okay so this is somewhere between eight and 12 lectures a week takes about 290 hours to build a month a month yeah right so so that's a lot so i probably spend to do our standard content of either two to three streams or video uploads it takes me about 100 hours a week so that's about 25 i mean 100 hours a month so it's almost 20 it's 24 hours a week basically um and it takes me about eight hours of work to do one stream or lecture just to give you all some other sense so like you know designing resource packs was a 230 hour investment go ahead i think we're we're wanting to kind of pull back the hood a little bit to kind of show you guys how much healthy gamer has grown so the full team including coaches mods editors is about 200 people at this point which is wild for something that just started with like all of streaming nights and weekends and i think it's really exciting to continue to build everything we just want to make sure that we're building what you want there are some kind of larger forces at play right because we've we made a number of decisions all it doesn't want to just be an online doctor like that has to take a thousand sponsorships and stuff like that right so we wanted to build actual services actual mental health resources so the way healthy gamer is funded then is with products that we're building ourselves and selling as opposed to just taking sponsors and essentially selling out right we're also not wanting to be a non-profit solely because we don't want to constantly be raising money we also didn't want to take investment capital because we didn't want to be beholden to somebody else like we don't want to do all of this just to make somebody else super rich like that's not the goal right we want to be able to price things as affordably as possible we want to build for you guys we don't want to be driven by an outside force so if we're not taking investors if we are super picky about sponsors if we've made the decision that like we want to actually practice what we preach and build the things that we wish existed then that's kind of what's led to a lot of these decisions so that's just like kind of background for all of the stuff that we wanted to talk to you about today like the impact that we've driven through the impact report and also like to show you guys how much some of this stuff takes which we love building we just want to show you yeah and i think the the big thing here is that so so we're investing in building stuff like just a couple of other things that you know we built so a couple things that worked really well so touch grass was awesome if you all remember the touch grass challenge right in the fields was awesome so right in the fields continues to evolve so that's part of the reason why you know it took our dev team weeks to build this and it's awesome and then we also want to show you all like we're going through some major updates with the guide and we'll talk a little bit about like why we're doing this but just to give you all a sense right so yeah so right in the fields is also included with the aoe healer membership now because it was so successful we wanted to kind of keep it going so it's in the membership tiers for aoe healer level yeah and so there's a couple of changes going on with the guide so we're making something that is a little bit more so i think originally i don't know if you all kind of remember this but we had this kind of sphere grid thing right so i don't know if anyone's playing ff7 rebirth but i am and i'm hooked and it's great and so i played ff10 many many years ago and i was like this is cool right so what we want is like in a character development kind of way like going back to the school of life 101 we want to make a competency-based grid for your life so it's like if you want to like you know become an expert at whatever like there's information here that we can we can we can unpack all of these things and like teach you these things one at a time and my vision was that someone could go through the guides and it's basically like a curriculum to teach you how you work and we're building it one guide at a time and and so we're starting with like very popular mental health topics and things like that but we're like inching into other things so guides are getting to the point where they're overwhelming so we got some feedback they're like i don't know where to start this is way too big because yeah like learning how to live life is like a complicated topic so we're going through some design changes and we're going to make things a little bit more linear and now it's going to be more like competencies that are easier to navigate so this is too confusing once we get i don't know if you guys can see this but there's like 49 videos in the adhd module 26 in the meditation 28 in anxiety 28 in depression and so there's too many dots it's just as overwhelming so we need to start reorganizing things and there's also more intersections between the guides so we're reorganizing this and then i think we're also moving into other things yeah so the other thing that we're kind of looking at is trying to let me see if i can find start your journey where is this going to be over to the side i'm looking for something in particular so we've grown our development team and also freed them up i think from some of the more mundane behind the scenes stuff so they have been i don't know i think this all looks really cool really interested in what you guys think and it's also one of my favorite things is so like tech teller has been with us from the beginning and i really don't think that there's anybody that can create a community and community experiences as good as tech does like i think he is the best of the best trinian has been with us from the beginning and i don't think anybody understands the features and functionality that make i don't know mental health education fun the way that trinian does so that's what's really cool about all of this is he's been with us forever oh so we should call him on discord yeah okay thanks tech but what is can you tell him to to dm me i don't know what his discord is yeah okay okay oh i i think we may not okay there we is okay all right let's see if you can okay hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on we got to do a couple things so brendan you're gonna have to walk us through this but i need to add a um i need to add a source audio output capture or say something trinian hi can you hear me one two three keep talking talking one two three four five six seven okay so the only thing is we're not going to be i'm going to put myself on mute you're going to be able to hear me but stream will not be able to hear me because we need to still get this stuff set up um and so why don't you talk us through the guide okay and i'll just drive sure what were you looking for earlier i was looking for the the the question question stuff is that here when we asked oh like which questions um like how like question-based recommendations yeah that is um can i share screen and show it on stream or actually you can do it too if you want to on figma click on the top right play button yeah so yeah um so the i think this is what you were looking for originally which is like these questions here which is like we are making the guide a little bit more questions based where if you want to answer this question about this specific domain in anxiety you would come to these little playlists or paths that you could do but basically the experience is um let me see here if i can is everything okay right now okay sure cool um so if we started from here um the idea is that we want to make it a little bit more custom and a little bit more guided so like you were mentioning before how we now have five modules now and the map itself as a sphere grid as a skill tree is kind of getting overwhelming um so our idea now is to make it a little bit more guided more personalized to um the user who comes in and you know wants to go through the guide and get some questions answered or go through specific modules that they are looking through so i'm going to skip this survey but basically right now there's an intake survey here that allows for us to get some basic information some baselines first and then that will customize the experience of how we recommend videos to the user how we kind of navigate them and guide them through all the modules of the guide so skipping this we're not going to feed don't have it for designs but um same as the current experience where there's a couple intro videos where you can watch kind of how to use the guides why the guides are developed and then kind of start your journey afterward and when you come to this view it's um we've kind of structured each of the modules now into more of a core knowledge path where you have core knowledge materials that is essential to the understanding as a baseline for the module itself so there's a core knowledge for anxiety is a core knowledge for depression all the other ones will have one too and as you go through each of these um core knowledge paths which is a few videos two to four not too many you'll get a basic understanding of how the module itself is structured and what you're supposed to what you want to what you can get out of it so once you kind of watch that core knowledge and you go back to all the paths um this is kind of where you can find out other paths within the specific module that you can explore to dive deeper on specific topics or learn more and kind of what we recommend to you here in this area like at the top under this progression is based off of what you answer in that baseline uh intake quiz and will be custom to each person and each module will have its own recommendation based off of um what originally the intake quiz kind of calculates mentioning before where we're basing a lot of the questions we're basing a lot of the module topics around questions that you want to get answered in the module itself and you can go through these playlists or these paths to answer these questions more completely if you watch them from beginning to end so um right now the only example we have is again this anxiety module um like core knowledge but each of these will be will contain a custom playlist of tracks um and custom videos that are based off around that core knowledge or that specific question that you may have around you know how do you understand the origins of anxiety if you click in here it'll be like a series of videos talking about anxiety behavior um you know if you're interested in the eastern perspectives off the anxiety there's a track for that too so it's really divided in much more digestible in terms of when you first jump into it so that's really like the idea behind new guide um how we're kind of structuring it and um there's still like the original features we have so we still do have the meditation index here where you can look at all the meditations we do have an improved glossary and uh we do have like favorited videos where you can come in here and you know favorite specific videos that you're interested in and come back to them later um okay so Brandon I muted you for a second um so I want to just tell y'all a couple of things um so Brandon you can stay in the call if you want to but I'm going to just talk for a second so the the other thing that we wanted to do or actually I'm going to hop out of the call um the other thing that we what we're kind of moving towards is that there are a couple of things to consider right so uh one is so we if we try to understand what's wrong with people's mental health in the world today so there's some lack of information right so if we go back to like this youtube comment right this is kind of like living life 101 right that's we're trying to address that with some of these things like this video like this video I was so happy it did well it's like 800 000 views a month ago and it's not like some you know famous guest or something like that it's just a really good video thankfully so there's teaching all the information but what we really discovered from things like right in the feels is that and this is why I'm so excited about right in the feels and why we continue to kind of build towards it so there used to be like okay well either we're going to give you information or if you want to get a particular outcome at a particular time you should sign up for coaching so we're huge fans of the coaching program we think the outcomes are really strong it's part of the reason that we get invited to give talks at places like the apa and things like that the career coaching program has also started off actually quite slow but has been steadily growing like ever since we launched it and we get really really really good feedback and and why did we build a career coaching program for a couple reasons the simplest is that see our approach to mental health is like there's some stuff that you need to do internally but there's no substitute for like external success like there's no substitute for security there's no substitute for financial freedom there's no substitute for like these real world things and so we built that program because we realized that people need help building their careers and that will have a positive impact on their mental health and this is just as a psychiatrist I realized like and I started doing this work a lot with my patients so when I had someone who was recovering from an addiction I'm working on a lecture on this but just the phases of addiction recovery but what I realized is that like ultimately this person if they want to stay sober they have to have a life that is worth living so the core reason why people keep on relapsing or not the reason one reason that I saw is that the cost of the relapse subconsciously is not very high there's a big difference between I'm unemployed and I'm trying to get sober and like let me just get high this weekend or let me get hammered this weekend like whatever I can pick things up later and and so once people really have something that is valuable to them and get it gets negatively affected by their behaviors that's when I really saw long-term sobriety become easier for people because if you think about kind of I know I'm going off on a tangent I swear I'll come back but if you kind of think about like on a given weekend right unless you have a life that is like full of joy and where you're progressing towards things and stuff like that like what's really the cost it's so easy to procrastinate on putting your life together if there are substances involved so we kind of we're like okay we're going to teach you all some stuff through things like lectures streams whatever and then there's coaching to help you accomplish your goals in a evidence-based kind of like time limited period and I think that's the real value is like it's not that you need it it's that the question is so so I recently started working with a swimming coach and why did I do that because I wanted to get better at swimming within like one month like I was like instead of just watching random ass YouTube videos I'm going to invest the time and energy because I want to be a proficient swimmer like 30 days from now not like whenever the hell I get around to it right and that's really what the value is is the other thing that I noticed in people's lives is that I think our field in psychiatry and even in public health like when I hear people talking about oh there's a mental health crisis like I don't get the sense that people really understand the urgency and maybe that's my projection but that like lives are being ruined in 90 day intervals like 90 days is what it takes to get a set of F's on your trend that will that is like permanent health damage that's not like temporary damage that you can heal that's like we're going to drop down from 100 max HP to like 90 max HP your life will be permanently harder because of that and that's the real urgency that that makes me focus on very like time intense time valuable efficient interventions so that's the other thing by the way that we wanted to build is we wanted to build intervention so that it's not just talking about mental health and like hey take my course I got some advice many years ago that hey like all you should do is like build courses and you'll be rich overnight and like that's fine like we do build courses and we try to make them as affordable as possible because they're purchased by people in 121 countries which is a win in our book and at the same time like I don't know if you guys know this but like you know courses on the internet don't usually run 20 or 25 or 30 or for 35 40 dollars they usually run like hundreds of dollars if not thousands of dollars and we very intentionally made the decision to not price things that way so going back to where we're going so right in the fields is really interesting because it is the first example of us trying to incorporate a skills building competence based component that is not coaching so the feedback that we got about coaching is that some people can't afford it which is understandable we try to you want something you want this um okay all right so this is kind of where where we're trying to go with right in the fields is like I think the next thing that we need to build is something that is personalized and more dynamic so now we have like this body of knowledge and we have certain interventions that we think will help people actually train the skills now the problem is we have so many different people who have so many different questions and interested in so many different things it doesn't work I don't know if this makes sense Dr. K showing up and answering a particular question on this particular thing on like April 8th doesn't fix the problem so what we really need to build is what we really need to build is something that is dynamic assembles all the crap that we have taught about and serves people up with what you need and that's why I thought it was so great that what Trinian is building is like the guide is fundamental I mean it's still there in linear you can go through all of it but the key thing is that you can show up you can figure out okay what questions matter to me we've spent literally two years on the research side developing like looking at evidence-based validated questionnaires and trying to figure out if someone comes in and says I struggle with my mental health what is the smallest number of questions to ask them to where we can use a validated instrument to detect what your problems are even if you're not aware of it and then using that set that battery of questions which we're trying to minimize because who the fuck likes filling out surveys then what we're going to do is direct you to the right kind of content and then this is where the the last thing so that piece is like completely new and then the the last piece that is also completely new is we've got the videos we don't have any way to direct people to the right videos and then the next thing is what are the interventions that we can build where once you're done watching the video you have information but you don't necessarily have behavioral change you don't have a boost to your eq that's what right in the feels does right so right in the feels has a really cool exercise called empathy labs and there's literally something called mentalization based therapy which is very very useful for people who are like narcissistic and in mentalization based therapy what we do is people who are narcissistic cannot understand what someone else's experiences and if we look at like all of these problems that people are having around loneliness and social isolation and like inability to form relationships and tired of making small talk what we can literally do is level up your eq through something like empathy labs and so we're developing these kinds of things where i think the next iteration is going to be right now we do content and we do coaching and coaching is very very value driven and it is still out of the reach of of a lot of people in our community so for content we have some a lot of free content and then some amount of paid content i don't think the paid content can really get any cheaper it's just it just can't economically but then there's a there's another thing that's missing which is okay if you want to like put together your life how can we direct you to all the right videos how can we even understand what your problems are using validated instruments that you may not know and then how can we develop some kind of tool that in a focused manner allows you to practice and improve whatever you're working on and so that's kind of like next big iteration for us so a lot of this stuff and so think but things are like one step at a time right and then there's like outside crazy stuff like people were like okay so when when we posted you know the name of this video and um and then this kind of happened you know like it's official we're headed to the ranch and as much as i want to do that i think that's also where like if we wanted to do that you know we would we would have to you know that takes a lot of money like i was talking to cruthy the other day but she was kind of explaining to me that most companies that end up where we are today with the amount of users engaged the number of people who are like have gone through coaching the number of people on discord who have a youtube channel the size that we are the average investment for a company investment for a company like this is between 20 and 100 million dollars yeah and i don't know if you guys have like you know if you followed some of these other uh so like let's just see if we can find that's the top article um we i just wanted to find the wikipedia just to give y'all like is this not in wikipedia oh god okay um so like i don't know if y'all have ever heard of like pair therapeutics but with pair therapeutics started maybe i don't know a couple of maybe a year oh founded in 2013 um and and so pair therapeutics was like this company that was built out of i think boston and like they were all about something called digital therapeutics so they're like we're going to take psychotherapy and we're going to like turn it into an app and they raised i don't know how much they they raised but um they went bankrupt it was over a hundred million dollars right so pair therapeutics like raised a hundred million dollars or over a hundred million dollars and then like you know like it kind of went bust which is sort of what's going on right now so a lot of these oh sorry go ahead no i just want to find the actual information um yeah but they were operating on losses over a hundred million dollars so they they made 12.7 million in revenue in 2022 and lost 123.4 million dollars so i think maybe where this is going is you know if we wanted to do this the way everybody else did this we would be trying to we would be doing a few things we would be really trying to play with insurance systems which i think we all know you don't get the best care when insurance is paying for it um one of the reasons why companies like pair go under is because if payers or insurers don't want to adopt what you're doing and that's what you're completely dependent on you can't you can't play in that space so essentially all all we're trying to say is for us to truly do this our way for us to truly say we want to build things for and with this community um we have to have our own kind of economics behind it we can't we don't want to depend on investors we don't want to depend on donations we don't want to over price and under deliver we don't want to do any of that so what we're trying to say is as you see things change if um i think we raised our module can i jump in yeah so i think i think people are super confused like people are asking questions like are we going bankrupt you're so chaotic okay let me let me let me let me tell you all what what's going on so here's here's where we're coming so i i think we're showing these i'm just showing you that as an example we're not about to go bankrupt okay so let me let me tell you all what's going on so we started this we started this to help you all i think we did really well we also built it to be sustainable right so this is where like and basically like the the one thing we've tried to avoid and i'm not saying we won't do this in the future but we've tried very carefully to be beholden to y'all right so when we because like think about it so this is where so when a startup starts right they get money from a couple of different places either you can go to the non-profit route which i know a bunch of people are big fans of i'm not a big fan of it because when you have a donor for whom you are dependent on for the survival of your enterprise and the donor walks in and says i want to start doing this you don't get to say no so like even compared to investors i think that i've worked very heavily with two non-profits and my experience with them is that that's when you actually have the least creative control for the direction of what the organization does because if the donor says something that's what you do right they provide the money so that's what you're beholden to you can take capital investment and in the case of capital investment it's good in a lot of ways a lot of people do it for good reasons right and i think if we had taken capital investment we would have been twice as big or three times as big or whatever like that's the whole point of it but then still it's like then someone has a financial interest in this that comes at the cost of the community and then the other option that we've got is sponsorships so that's where like to be blunt we turn down sponsorships that are an order of magnitude higher than what we accept from many people and the reason we do that is because it doesn't feel right right so like for example if i were to take let's just say hypothetically like a gambling sponsorship those pay a lot or a crypto sponsorship those pay a lot and we choose not to take those so we want to be sustainable we don't want to be beholden to someone else we don't want to take that gambling sponsor i'm fine with raid shadow legends tbh so you guys have seen more sponsorships on our channel and we're doing that because here's the question is like where does the money come from the more money we take from sponsors the more we can build stuff at a reduced cost or free so if we don't take if we don't sell out to sponsors then we got to sell out to someone the money's got to come from somewhere and our our choice so far on balance has been we're going to build stuff that y'all want and we're going to be beholden to y'all that's it there's no and then if you guys want a ranch then we need like way way way way way more money which i'm not suggesting that we do because i don't even know what the fuck would happen there but it's like it's basically like with the main thing that we're going to try to build there's nothing there's not anything after this the main thing that we want to build or the point of this stream is to tell you all we're migrating more towards this model of like okay let's understand what your needs are a little bit better and let's build more stuff on the skills side the skills building side accountability side so that people are actually like implementing those changes that's very different from working with a coach and me making lectures so this is this is where people are saying what's wrong with crypto and and you're right so here's the challenge that we face i want you to just think about this for a second okay so whatever decision we make one slice of our community is going to be unhappy because some people are like yeah you should absolutely like i live in a developing country i can't afford much fair enough right i think on balance it's way better if you can take 10 million dollars from an exclusive streaming deal on a different platform that shall shall remain unnamed right if you take an exclusive like sure if it builds me free stuff and i'm living in like bangladesh like go for it like what the hell do i care you can go ahead and do that on the flip side other people will be like no this is not right you guys should be a non-profit and so be like no this is not right you guys should be a non-profit and so then that's totally fine but then like our operations would be way different if we were a non-profit like i don't think we would produce half as much content i think we would have produced half the content if even my gut check is we would produce five times more if we took capital investment twice as much or three times as much if we took just whatever sponsorship came in the door right like we could but we choose not to and so our goal in today it's not we're not we're not stressed out or anything it's just we're telling you all right so the like and where does it come from and we kind of decide we'd rather build half as much but be careful about who we take as sponsorships not take capital investment and then charge y'all money for what we build because i think that's when you actually get the best relationship because there isn't a third party like this is what we fucking see in the american insurance system is like doctor thinks that a patient needs something patient likes it or doesn't like it the two of y'all are involved and y'all can either work it out or not oh wow hey tino how are you doing man that's great so tino is a very good friend of mine from medical school who's also an amazing psychiatrist and um it's cool to see how you're doing bro i will text you later thanks for stopping by um and so the the main thing that we want to tell you all is and that's fine so any given person can say i think this is the way that you should do it which is fine our experience unfortunately has been that whatever we do some group of people thinks that we should be doing it differently which they're not wrong it's just this is the reason we do it this way and um what we really want to build we want to build more for y'all so the other purpose of this is like to tell y'all what we're thinking right so there's one more guide coming out i started working on another book um we are going to continue with memberships because i think people are finding like really really immense value out of that we understand and acknowledge that because there's value other people may benefit from it as well and we're not deaf to that feedback at all it's just trying to figure out okay like how do we make this work for people who can't afford it and we're working on it actively um and then yeah if you guys want to ranch like you know someone needs to pony up 100 million dollars and then we'll do it or we can go at the slow way and we'll it'll take it slow study sustainable way but okay here's okay let me take i'm done good all right so just on the kind of how we're evolving and how we're changing i just want to make it like really simple nothing nothing dramatic is happening essentially we are seeing the need to raise prices so we're raising some prices i think we really dramatically underpriced during the pandemic again we wanted to meet people where they're at we didn't want to charge thousands of dollars for courses and stuff like that so but we do need to steer the ship right and again there's about 200 people behind healthy gamer at this point so we are raising the prices on the guides we are adding more coaching types and there are there should be i think more coaching spots coming next week there are some now we are really investing a lot i think in two core areas one is the hg institute okay mic closer it is the institute okay mic closer it is it's look i can touch it with my chin it's right in my face and maybe you speak louder okay all right so two core areas of investment going forward one is with the hg institute so the hg institute is an accredited continuing education platform so the coolest thing like our dream right is that you guys can work with therapists and like real mental health clinicians who understand the hg way and the institute is accredited by the american psychological association by the social work social worker board and we're working on a couple more accreditations one is also with nadac which is the addictions group they are the ones who run the pg peer support certifications so we're really investing a lot in kind of that aoe of now teachers therapists other people can learn the healthy gamer way and employ that in their own practice so really excited about that it's very resource intensive it is very i don't know if you guys are familiar with health care regulations but like every state has their own licensing it is is just the most bureaucratic ridiculous thing but i really think it's going to be worth it in the end to spread what we know to other people who work with young people and then another big area is in this community layer so we started with memberships and we're wanting to create more kind of experiences so we have the guides and we're adding the trauma module that'll be ready for presale next week so we're really excited about that one coming out but the real kind of what we've heard is skills right we do a lot of teaching and content and we are working on coaching where people can kind of create those lasting changes but what we're really hearing is the need for developing skills so that's why right in the fields is so great because it's really teaching eq and eq skills so we're wanting to invest more in this in this community layer through memberships and other things that's i think the long and short of kind of where we're going i would really love to open the floor for questions so i think we're going to just kind of gravitate towards chat and tuck teller did you want to run any polls or get any input feel free to all right will the institute ever be accredited in other places than the us great question that's why we're working with nadac nadac is an international organization so they do addiction support internationally yes we do want it to be accredited internationally can you specify new pricing yes so of all like we wanted to kind of show you guys how much work is going on behind the scenes right we wanted to show you how much work the developers are putting into mobile experiences to new features and functionality all that good stuff where we raised prices by five dollars across the healthy gamer portfolio so guides were 25 a module they're now 30 a module coaching was starting at 30 per session which is now at 35 per session so so i regret to inform you all that now the guide is officially more expensive than horse armor dlc and diablo 4 and this was a generally speaking when we're trying to think about the value that we deliver with products we really ask ourselves does this help people more than horse armor cosmetics in an action game and you know i have to say that this was a huge personal loss to me because i feel like when i think about the value of horse armor dlc i don't know if the trauma guide can match it because just think about how beautiful that horse looks with the horse armor okay i'm gonna take the mic back um okay um the main thing is i wanted to also all right any questions guys all right i think i'm hoping that this is where we can kind of stabilize on pricing i really we really want to keep things affordable i realize kind of with every price increase that means some people get left behind but that's why we're also trying to do things that are like 10 bucks a month um so people can kind of join in when they can and they can take a break very easily take a break very easily oh perfect live chat top chat no you have it live chat oh no we don't see questions but yes maybe it's not uh i think you know what i think i know how to find it let me see if it's over here can you also yes you guys are getting a behind the scenes look at what it's like to work with aloak it really takes like 20 can you send me to try to draw a slack dm with links from aloak to make everything actionable okay it is uh no the problem is the the plugin the chat plugin on obs i don't think has the same functionality okay so we need a pop-out link and then we'll find questions oh that's the problem if i'm on this side of the mic does that help you need a new mic why is this still a problem because we've had the production company out here like three times i know and they got me they got that amplifier thing which makes it gives it a buzz so we that didn't work so that's do you want to see alex performance review okay all right maybe we'll do that we'll do alex performance review um i see fan funding you know he got kicked out of all of our management meetings i do not belong there no it was such a mess he has been stripped of all of his direct reports he has been kicked out of all of management meetings um but really we just as you guys would say we want to just let him cook that's the goal meets expectations most of the time yes uh the i see a question do i have to buy the new module separately so if you're already a customer i believe you will get if you already have purchased the guide you will get i think preferred pricing on launch um i don't know the complete details there but if you already have the guides um you'll be getting an email that lays out what the pricing looks like but we do have some um preferred pricing for current customers again if you bought modules before at 25 bucks we want to like kind of honor that that's the value exchange what is happening to the module bundle so we always like to bundle things and discount it so right now you get four modules for 100 when the trauma module comes out i believe you will get five for 120 bye methane sorry yeah we're talking shop here today oh of course you keep the old guide um i think everything will be updated to the new interface but i'm not trinian would have details there on if it's a forest update or if you can update on your own loyalty pricing that's exactly that's exactly right any new book in the works um yeah he's writing no don't tell him what it's about it's secret okay okay i've i've heard the request for regional pricing a lot i i don't know how to do that and we are building so many things that really pricing should be appropriate it's going to be on the higher side for some currencies but we don't we don't have that ability for regional pricing right now um non-english yes we are about to release the guides in spanish and we're doing it kind of one at a time okay okay okay okay can i pay with my hsa we are working on ways to do that um again it's through the institute and it's going to be kind of a long i don't know bureaucratic road but we are working on ways for your people to use their benefits to be able to purchase healthy gamer resources essentially there's we're working really hard on how to plug in like our funky little experiment that is healthy gamer into the larger mental health ecosystem like one day i would love to have therapists med management like in-person experiences i would love to do the full stack we just got to get there kind of step by step instead of trying to do everything all at once we've we've kind of tried to be ambitious and do many things at the same time and it just doesn't go as well for us so we want to be able to really do things super well one thing at a time and the rest of the year is really around the institute and community so what is the hg institute exactly i believe the website is hg institute dot com hg institute essentially says okay here is what we think therapists should know before they start working with this community so it takes kind of a lot of the same principles and ideas but it packages it up for clinicians so clinicians can get credit for their continuing education requirements and we can help therapists do great work with young people we've heard so much from therapists saying hey i really want to implement this stuff in my own practice and we've heard so much from the community hey i tried therapy it really did not go well so i think there's an acknowledgement in the therapy world that like hey we don't really know how to work with young people as well as we should and so we said hey we think we can help and so we are trying to help therapists help you how do you guys not have merch we have merch we are just not very good at merch but we have it yeah and and related to that part of the reason i mean so merch is is great like honestly it's great like don't get me wrong but we're we're pretty focused on trying to primarily offer value if y'all are purchasing something so like i love the hoodies like the hoodies are great i like merch there's nothing wrong with it but if when i when i really think about it it's like what do we want to invest if we're going to charge y'all 30 bucks for something do we want to prioritize the merch store or do we want to prioritize building a guide to trauma and that's where the merch store just does not the merch store like yeah we just haven't we haven't figured out how to we we wanted to do more than sell t-shirts but i would like to actually have some better merch on there can you please go back to chat what are you doing i'm going to chat okay i'm trying to get to chat but twitch is showing me ads on your own stream yes i it's yeah so i'm gonna have to figure out sorry we have to watch our own there we are so let's it's the top right arrow thank you you're the best i am indeed okay um there was a great question that i was there double chats sir could we offer japa mullah in merch it is it is hard to find legit ones we have been trying for three years um to put together meditation kits for the merch store with like a good yoga mat good incense good candles like good stuff um but i don't want to sell you a 200 dollar meditation kit that has like stupid stuff in it you know what i mean i want to we haven't been able to price it the way we want to price it and find the stuff that we want to find but we are working on it yeah so just to give you all just we got it we can't both answer all of the questions no but this is worth this is cool okay so like if you want to verify the authenticity of rudraksh right which is oftentimes used in malas you actually have to x-ray it so like the quality controls for some of this stuff which like i know there's probably not science to it but i really do believe that some of these things are like like dnd and video games like have magical powers that give you like a plus 10 to your meditation check or whatever so so you know part of building some of this stuff is like we want to find like high quality stuff and that's like hard to do yeah good good rudraksh is like hard to come by so like a good rudraksh mala like you know is is i think at least 50 dollars and then there's also the concern of like okay what if people can't afford it so then then what do we do um yeah so people are saying tulsi over rudraksh and that makes a lot of sense right so tulsi is way easier to get and then it's like before we start some of this stuff is honestly my fault because then what what i'm trying to do is is understand really what the attributes of each of these kinds of malas is because everyone says use rudraksh but you can use sukhard you can use rosewood you can use crystal you can use different kinds of stone and so i'm i'm i'm going to show you all a couple of books in a second but i'm doing research and trying to figure out what are the actual like if you use a particular crafting material what is the spiritual buff that you get i'm going to let her answer more questions while i show you all what i've been doing also trinian if you're around and want to take any of the specifics in chat um please feel free to somebody asked for paypal we do have paypal um somebody asked for paypal we do have paypal on the guides but we don't have paypal for coaching um because paypal i don't believe lets us set up recurring billing so it's just kind of logistically very complicated canada no membership access okay we'll look into that we'll look into that is this his lady yeah i'm mrs k hi nice to meet you you still can't hear me this is wild okay so will it still be called healthy gamer when healthy creator comes out yeah healthy creator is kind of a spinoff brand but what we do is pretty core so i wouldn't yeah the healthy gamer brand is kind of here to stay okay where can we go as community to give feedback or opinions whatever on anything so we watch the reddit um it's kind of you know a double edged sword because usually the most inflammatory stuff on reddit gets to the top so it's you know pretty accusatory and pretty hostile but we're always listening we look at comments on youtube our internal slack channel is always like hey did you see this comment i think this person makes a great point these people are asking for this kind of content can we do this can we do that um so we're kind of always listening the stream honestly is in response or not really we like to communicate with you guys every one every quarter or so um but this is a great avenue to ask whatever you want to ask yeah just just piggybacking off of that i think this is this is i mean this is why we do things like this right so the goal of the stream today is for us to share a little bit about what we're thinking um so you all have some context for some of the direction that hg is going and also for you all to ask questions and stuff like that so i see a couple other questions so i just want to show you all so i'm doing research so two of these books are by david frolly tantric yoga and month are the primal sound and then the really interesting thing if you really want answers in this you actually have to go back to like the puranas so someone asked me a question recently about reincarnation so more people are asking about um like how do i access past lives so i'm not sure is the short answer but we have to kind of dig deep um and i'll just give you all an example so like there's a chapter in the gharud puran where he talks about the process of rebirth process of rebirth um so like this is so this stuff is hilarious okay um those with a positive credit to their ultimate account get birth in noble or good houses they are conceived on the eighth day after the menses of their potential mother the copulation on the eighth day ensures birth of sons thereafter the copulation on the even number of days results in the birth of a male child and on odd days daughters okay that's too much information for you um so the kind of productive period is hardly available for any other species the woman should have sweet edibles on the fifth day and refrain from eating bitter and astringent or spicy food so there's all kinds of weird stuff in here right and like this stuff doesn't have a good index and like a lot of it is super wild like there's all kinds of stuff about all kinds of things and so it's kind of fun for me because i'm digging because this stuff isn't indexed so these a lot of these things are passed through through oral tradition and um you know in retrospect it's not like i gave you sweet edibles the fifth day after copulation which is why we've got two girls that's where we went wrong i wouldn't say that's going wrong i mean if you should be giving me sweet edibles and you are not giving me sweet edibles i would say that we are going wrong yes okay um there were a couple of questions uh that i wanted to get to that were more serious so first is are we going to build more guides absolutely so um you know we're building them basically as fast as we can just to give you all some context uh you know building one guide takes about eight weeks of scripting time so there's research time and then i write for about eight weeks the the size of a guide in terms of script is basically equivalent to one non-fiction book so the final manuscript of how to raise a healthy gamer was about the same size as like a guide script so you all can think about the investment is basically the time it takes me to write a i mean a book is more in in many ways because there's editing and all this other crap so we're going to build more guides um i'm leaning towards something around so we're probably going to build a guide to addiction next because that's one that we need to do at some point and then the other one that i really want to build is like sex communication and relationships and then we may build something on gender specific mental health as well so those are the kinds of things don't don't do this don't log in no not here you can't type um if you want to do this then we should go here so we're we want to build more guides for sure it's just about what we do when um we are thinking about transitioning to more of like a monthly subscription i'm interested in what your thoughts are about that instead of like a one-time pay kind of thing would that help or would that i don't know do you want to just kind of pay for it once and be done i personally hate monthly subscriptions so yeah that's why so i don't i mean because also right like we're one of the few people on the internet who continues to do this i mean memberships i think is a little bit different because the whole goal of that is like for it to be longitudinal and stuff like that it's also way cheaper but um yeah so like that was something that we you know we got a lot of advice to do the opposite right because everyone's moving into subscription model but thank god that we even have people on our dev team who are like the subscription model is evil yeah no we like we so much our dev team is awesome and i think a lot a lot of why we do what we do is because we're like monthly subscriptions are annoying let's just do one and done okay what's a good price point for one and done and so the way we price things is essentially to be able to give it to you and something that's a little less i don't know spammy scammy kind of thing right and and i want you all to just think about this right so this is where we get some credit because we did it is a one-time purchase and i think somewhat reasonably priced and like because like you know and and so we're committed to doing that kind of stuff to fight the tide of of soulless whatever um so many fights man you have to fight it dude it's so hard man it's like so hard um so yeah addiction for sure and then some something around communication and relationships and then something around gender specific struggles and then something about sexuality like those are all topics i think the other thing that we oftentimes will explore is whether a guide is the best way to explore a topic can i just get a sense of okay so we're doing the trauma module the trauma module comes out for presale next week after that we're we're debating between addictions like behavioral and substance abuse um and sex dating relationships do you guys okay one for addictions and two for communication relationships can i just see like what you guys would prefer one for addictions two for relationships okay we gotta be listening i i know i'm gonna just do what you want i'm in control now oh lord help us all right i'm seeing a lot of twos from i thought addictions all of it consists that communication relationships no no no no who said which guy pole coming um addictions communication and relationships um sexuality male female mental health okay okay all right so this is okay so addiction seems addiction communication relationships are basically tied we need a tiebreaker no i mean i think i think then addictions will come first because i think communication and relationships is way oh shit communication relationships is winning so here's kind of my point of view and i'm interested in what you would think too in my point of view the guides are about mental health topics because coaching has limitations right the coaches are not therapists so the mental health content like the harder hitting more technical more regulated information should be in guides whereas coaches i think have incredible outcomes navigating individual situations around communication relationships so that's kind of how i've been thinking about it but i'm really interested in what you guys think about that yeah and and i saw someone ask about finding life purpose so we could build a guide on that but uh i think um with that that's the reason that we have these resource packs and stuff so we're trying to like i know that everybody wants everything and we're trying to sort of get to it one at a time the other thing that i've been really wondering about is whether a guide is the best format to work on communication and relationships so the other super cool thing that i'm starting to appreciate is that we don't need a guide on all topics some things are better as a lecture we did our first workshop which went really really well um you know that workshop was fantastic and people got so much out of it and it was also difficult in some ways but i think i wonder if for communication and relationships whether there is a different kind of thing because when i kind of think about communication and relationships i really think about a group coaching format is ideal yeah so when i do like actual like i was thinking about starting another group recently but um not really specifically around relationships and uh so because some stuff is like it's just hard to describe but some stuff like if you guys get to practice stuff and talk about your feelings and other people listen to you and things like that i think there's a lot of potential there yeah so one idea um tech if you wanted to jump into chat and clarify this please feel free to but one idea we had was evolving groups more around practicing social skills so yes definitely a discussion and talking component but much heavier on the like practicing component um but but i definitely i definitely think like communication relationships is so individual that you can have all the theory in the world but you need to be able to like practice it and run things by people so that's why i like groups for communication relationships too okay all righty any other questions how are we on time we're doing okay we're okay on time okay bassy boy i hear you like get making friends as an adult is difficult honestly alok alok's like my wingman at the playground he will like go and be like she looks like she would be a great friend to you i'm gonna go talk to her for you and he will like pick up friends for me at the playground it is incredible but some of my best mom friends are his work spirituality module well we have a meditation guide you know i was thinking about either doing this on the membership side or as a workshop but like we did a cool course at hgi about a year ago about developing a personalized meditation practice it was a so this was of course at the institute for people who are like coaches and mental health professionals so we all hear that okay like for these kinds of for these kinds of professions right oh like we all like people are teaching mindfulness now as therapists um these professions have can be like prone to emotional burnout so how can we help the the people who are delivering mental health services develop their own personalized meditation practice i think it was it was one of the most scuffed things that i ever put together had so many problems and it was also like really really great for all the people like there were a lot of things that we didn't do right um just in terms of the organization and stuff but people got such immense value out of that i'm thinking about whether we should put that together in some way um yeah so so someone's asking uh how do you even create a guide on interpersonal relationships too many people at too many stages of emotional intelligence or ability and the eventual romance desperate cringe yeah i i hear you so i think that's part of what makes it challenging and the reason even though people voted on addictions and communication relationships the reason that addictions will probably come first is because making a guide to addictions is way easier than making a guide to communication relationships so i've been working on a guide to communication relationships for three years and the problem is like i don't know what to include and what not to include so there's probably and we i mean i we're working on it but i think it's like this will happen and then we also sort of think about you know even things like touch grass and social sandbox right so we have we have so many things in our community that are address those problems it doesn't necessarily have to be a guide but ideally and this is kind of where we're evolving right so i guess we thought everyone thought that there was some you know big change like we're going bankrupt or we're buying a ranch or whatever no it's just we're going bankrupt because we bought a ranch so the main thing is that we're trying to basically like the next phase of what we want to do is combine things like information like guides with things like social sandbox which is very successful by the way right and it's like how can we create a situation where y'all can like practice and implement changes increase accountability and so his accountability is neurodivergence absolutely right um yeah yeah so people and i think a lot of this stuff so remember y'all that we don't have to make a guide about everything right so like i remember we have i mean we make you know we have like 800 or a thousand videos on our youtube channel and so we can so just to give you all an example i've i'm working on two videos right now two lectures one on autism being an autistic woman and the second is being a woman and having adhd because for example like girls get under diagnosed with adhd because they tend to be less hyperactive and the hyperactive symptoms are the things that really cause problems and lead to an early diagnosis so girls are more likely to engage in a lot of compensatory and masking behaviors which means that they get under diagnosed and so the other thing is that's kind of wild is there's hormonal manifestations or hormonal changes that will affect things like concentration and potentially even aspects of neurodivergence so um there's a lot of like stuff there that needs to be talked about so like one thing just to keep in mind no matter all this stuff that we do more guides more memberships whatever like our bread and butter of making free mental health content and putting it on the internet on a weekly basis that is inspired evidence-based and high quality like our commitment to that is not changing and i think it's just because we're doing a dip so this is the key thing to understand we're not replacing any of the stuff that we do for free it's always in addition and then the question is how do we fund that stuff so i've got a bank of like five or six really great videos that i'm working on right now lectures call them whatever you want to there may be one or two deep dives in there we haven't given up on deep dives right so we do them occasionally um and and so it's not everything two hour deep dive stream probably takes like 12 hours to prepare just by the way yeah so grithi was asking am i was i reading something and like you know yeah i won't grab it great hey i have a question for you guys um so as we try to package up all of this um content and these kinds of community events um and also these like experiential kind of skills-based programs would you rather see that in an app or would you rather see that in like a membership kind of model like would you rather it just be available on your content platforms and be able to log in that way or would you prefer in an app yeah can somebody that's not alok run the poll tech teller are you there i think danana has things under control on on twitch all right cool i see she is present and when she is present i function normally yeah danana is a real one another person that's been with us for over four years she doesn't know how to pull i'm i'm on it danana oh no you don't have to do everything oh no i can do some things myself honestly just the fact that all it can get from like this room into okay a podcast with somebody else is all danana i'm wondering if should we build an app essentially i've always thought no i think it's too much work to maintain too much stuff and it's 2024 who needs another app but you know there's a lot of added benefit because we can do things exactly so the options are the way we want would you rather see like a membership that is on a patreon or a youtube membership or something like that or would you rather have it in an app should i remove this option yeah anytime you can simplify we simplify app or membership okay website is the best no install keep cost down i agree i'm biasing you and i i'm almost positive if um you know if like our product team was more present here they would be able to argue all of the you know extra features and functionality we could do with an app the main thing that we really want to be able to do so we have i don't know if y'all know this we have i think seven research studies going right now on the efficacy of all of our different programs one thing we really want to bake in is like when you start this membership experience or this monthly experience kind of what is your baseline mental health look like and then what what real benefit what real world outcome does this program drive so we're trying to put together a pretty sophisticated like learning model i guess like what we call like the client profile where we can really understand okay if by watching this guy did this person's adhd actually get better did their depression actually get better so we're trying to measure that which i think is enabled by an app but i'm wondering if we can do it without that mobile compatibility for the platform totally agree the developers have put a ton in to make the guides more mobile friendly so when the trauma module comes out you're going to see a lot of enhanced mobile functionality and a lot better indexing and organization in general swanson yes we will be continuing to grow the coaching program okay well this has been super helpful and it's been really fun to kind of get to spend time with you guys i have a bunch of meetings and things that i need to get to do you want to wrap up with everyone sure i'll do that all right cool thanks chat i appreciate it thank you for making it i will take it yeah we got to figure out this i mean these guys everybody works so hard here yeah so huge huge shout out you know i know everyone's like oh volume is low volume is low like i think it's we've had people come in and look at the setup and we've changed out can i just say one more thing yeah please check out the impact report i don't know if you guys if mods y'all can link it in chat but we're really really proud of everything that we got to accomplish last year and we're really excited to grow the institute and all of our community experiences this year always open to feedback the whole point of this is to make stuff for you guys so it's been cool hanging out with you bye yeah anger management you know it's great that you mention anger management so one of the really interesting things is that anger management is a topic under performs are you going to claim this ever yeah ever um so so i mean i get super excited learning about anger there's i got a great book by erin beck on anger which i thought was good but like i don't know why it's just people don't seem to care about anger but we'll still continue making it right so this is also where we don't and we make videos all the time that we think won't perform well because we think they should be made um i can't get out how did you get in i don't know maybe you made a mess on the way in which is why you can't get out well the the seven sets of keys here yeah give me a second chat here i help i help i'm a hostage yes that's the way that you guys if y'all can please yeah can we please get alok to clean his room he's wheeling my chair out and on the way this chair has picked up one mask like a covid mask three sets of keys it's stumbled over i don't know like 12 piles of paper it's crazy i don't know like 12 piles of paper it's crazy take take your work if you keep exposing me then i may have to feed you sweet edibles the fifth day after your whatever menses for after copulation generally speaking i find that that feeding you sweet edibles works better before copulation but i wasn't reading the garad poran okay um all right yeah i i mean some things are clean in my place and some things are not clean i don't know if y'all do this this is what i do where when i clean something i make a mess first so i dump everything on the floor and i like organize it and then like i never finish the cleanliness is a core part of spirituality so right now my my place my room is in this phase of it's just because i've been i've been like just traveling so much i have like two media things a week um i've been to like california new york like over the last month which is awesome i'm not complaining but it's like in the grand scheme of things i think it's okay to be messy during this particular period and i actually cleaned this morning because now i'm like back and then this week weekend i'm going to just be making stuff it's going to be dr k going um okay so i i think we're at time for the day uh sorry we didn't get to everybody's questions but you know i i guess we should have been pretty clear there's not the way we were talking at the beginning everyone's like oh my god what's happening what's are y'all bankrupt no we're not bankrupt um we're just sharing with y'all because we this used to be a lot more organic the community used to be way smaller right so it's like the same 200 people are showing up and we're thinking through things together and like i could follow what chat said and now things have changed a little bit we've got bigger teams we're trying to do more and we you know it's very helpful for us to know what y'all want because everything that we build is you know not it's not like we're sitting there and like we're like oh you know what i think the people really need they need a really they need they really want 25 horse armor dlc that's what the people need so that's what we're going to build so we tend to actually ask y'all hey what do you all want and even with this stuff like we're committed to trying to make as much mental health stuff resources content tools as we can and then it's just an issue of like okay do we do it if we do it one particular way we grow half as fast if we do it a different particular way we grow twice as fast but we make certain trade-offs and that's how it is like karmically right so either you you know you take that that sponsorship and you get that sweet sweet crypto coin and then we have more money to build free stuff but we've chosen not to do that so we just wanted to share that perspective with y'all we don't you know i know a lot of people have a lot of different opinions our biggest problem is that y'all don't agree right so we're happy to do what y'all want and that's usually what we do so even now like when y'all say okay we want to we want y'all to build these two guides those are the two things that i'm going to work on um and when y'all say we like you know platform specific stuff as opposed to an app like that's what we'll lean into and then at some point there may be there there may be some once there's a good enough reason we may migrate over but right now we're trying to build everything on the platform which which our dev team has done an awesome job um you know and cool you know people saying does does a couple of last questions uh yeah that was my wife um someone saying i like trains cool i've never understood the appeal i mean i like riding on trains like i took a train in europe once from netherlands to france and it was like amazing um does making hg bigger scare you it doesn't scare me i like it less it makes things complicated and it means that we have to spend brain power or i have to spend brain power on things that i don't enjoy spending brain power on but i'm not scared of it it's just so i don't know if you all know this but we had back in the day we had a retreat we held an in-person retreat and um and like nine or ten people eight nine ten people showed up from like all corners of i think the united states and canada and we had been streaming for maybe about a year and i was like we should have a retreat there was like a hundred people or not a year maybe six months ago and it was great we like i rented out an airbnb people just had to pay for their flights for their flights and then it was like manageable and like we cooked together and we like meditated together and we went on hikes and stuff together um but we can't do that now right so and it's cool because even even people who now like work for us like there were some of our i want to say that three or four people from the retreat like 40 percent of people who came were working with us in some way and now i think only one or two of those those people are left one person has left and started their own company which is doing really well and they're crushing it another person is halfway through a phd and they're doing really well which is great um but we just can't it just gets complicated when things get big um but yeah uh well the parenting course have additions probably at some point but i think we're trying to set up more of a robust like q and a kind of thing um so we're definitely seeing a lot of influx of people into our community because of the book and so those people need support too so speaking of other things that we're building we're building more robust resources to support parents are you worried that as you expand your core message aim gets diluted 100 it has to see staying to your core message is a luxury that must be bought in certain ways so i've seen the operations of many different organizations including very mission-driven organizations and um you know there's there's a you know anyway i'm not going to give examples but absolutely right so like it's easy to hold a retreat and have it be free when nine people are showing up and i have a doctor's salary it's hard to do that when there's like two million of y'all and we try to build a bunch of stuff for free so there's certain there's certain like things that used to be simple which now become complicated and that's one of the things that i've learned which is just the price of growth and um and the trauma module will probably come out in about a month do you plan to always be the face of healthy gamer i certainly hope not i never wanted to be the face yeah melissa started like saying i miss the one-on-one with viewers i do too i mean honestly i i miss it a lot so like there's a reason why we started with that because that's what i personally find gratifying and enjoyable like i like just talking to people and then this whole thing started so this is something that we've seen we worked with about 500 content creators here at hg and what we always find is the same pattern which is that the bigger that you grow as a content creator the less freedom you have but anyway um yeah scaling is hard it is um yeah trauma module hopefully in about a month so i think we did didn't we i show speed oh yeah dude i'm down to his stream with i show speed let's do it down to a stream yes see original people who are back in the day yeah we got to work on that i owe y'all a lot um it's great mr beast will give me the money yeah i mean we'll see tech teller is saying no no to what i should speak mr beast look so so generally speaking just just a quick reminder right about we're generally speaking we're open to talking to many many many many people i'm not saying we're going to talk to everybody but like i think part of what i believe just as a psychiatrist and what i've learned is that like most people are fundamentally decent human beings and that the majority of them are just trying to do the right thing and based on the way that they've been raised or what they're struggling with internally that usually results in a lot of behaviors that get harshly judged and so what we try to do here is have conversations with people about what their experience of of being what's it like to be in life so yeah so someone's saying i should just do what i i should just do what i like limit the people and just enjoy yourself i wish i had that luxury but i decided some time ago that i get to enjoy some things in life but this life is not primarily for my enjoyment it's primarily service and maybe that'll change maybe one day i'll wake up and i'll say you know helping x number of whether it's a hundred a thousand ten thousand a million i don't know how many people i've helped at this point i have no idea how to quantify that maybe one day i'll wake up and i'll say that's enough but that's that hasn't happened yet um so it's kind of weird but you know cruthey and i actually had a conversation about six eight months ago about like what are we really entitled to in life so like we could do things differently but why are we more deserving than so we work really hard and there's a very common kind of idea that okay if you work really hard you deserve good stuff which i'm i'm not against by any means and at the same time like do i work any harder than like a single parent who's working two jobs and trying to support their family and like no i don't think so i mean i've had plenty of those people as my patients and they work really hard too so i try to get what enjoyment i can where i can and i try to spend most of my week like trying to make the world a slightly better place because in my life there were people who did that for me and that's the only way it works but i appreciate the sentiment how can we best support your mental health giving you money so i wish the answer to that was yes but i think my mental health is primarily my responsibility but i appreciate the sentiment one thing i will say is that i think one thing that i think people underestimate so people will make comments they'll post things in chat they'll post things on sub reddits they'll post things on youtube comments i think oftentimes when we post things on the internet we do not think about how it affects the person who's reading it or what we do is we justify our actions based on some perception of what their life is like because this person did this it's okay for me to be cruel to them it's and oftentimes we don't see it as cruelty we see it as i'm being honest or i'm holding them accountable or they deserve this but there's just a lot of nastiness on the internet and i think just even being a content creator like sometimes i see it right and i notice the effect it has on me and it does have a very real effect and i think oftentimes when we complain we don't really think about we feel fully justified in the complaint which is fine but we oftentimes don't think about the impact that it has on other people so i'd encourage all of you to really think about the impact of your words and as best as possible try to be as non-violent with them as possible so even if you had have feedback to give you know just think about the people in your life who the feedback is kind of an emotional attack and the feedback is well thought out and comes from a place of positivity and this isn't just about me i mean i think i'm quite lucky and for the majority of our community is incredibly incredibly nice and that by the way you all deserve huge praise for because like part of the reason i continue doing this is because for every bad apple there's like 99 of y'all that are awesome like i was eating a taco the other day and someone walked up to me and was like hey are you dr k and i was like yeah and he's like hey i appreciate the work you do it's helped me a lot and then we kind of stood there awkwardly for a little while and i was asking the person i was like hey do you want a picture and he's like no i'm good i'm like hell yeah just bump because i never know if people sometimes want pictures and it's like you can that's fine you can ask at it i don't i don't mind but i never know and people are super nice i've noticed that sometimes people will like if i'm with my family they don't bother me or anything and i'm very grateful for that and if y'all do see me on the street like it's okay to say hi like that's fine i'm not i'm not so important that oh my god i can't say hi back and if i'm having a rough day i'll let you know but i think really like the best thing that you can do for me um we've i think we've made it clear today what we do with the money or what we want money for but it's not to give us more money it's take the effort that we're putting in and build a life that's worth living like utilize our resources that's honestly what we're here for so what we the reason we build it is for y'all to use right so what's the best thing you can do for someone who like makes you a sandwich is to eat the sandwich and try to enjoy it as best as possible you have gird and inflammation how do you feel better what a great question maybe we'll start talking about things like gird more um i did a lot of clinical work with people who had gird so it's weird i got all these like there's a there's a video on the trauma guide about somatic illness um which we call kind of psychosomatic illness but with gird it's a little bit different but depends on the source of your gird right so talk to a doctor because we have things like proton pump inhibitors and things like that that can help with a lot with gird but there's also all kinds of cool stuff on probiotics so um studies show that like for example kimchi or yogurt or uh what's it called um not just yogurt but dog what's the other name for it kefir not the lime leaves but kefir the yogurt based stuff there's some evidence that some of these probiotic things can actually be good for gird but we've got pretty good pretty good uh medicine for it if you guys just see a doctor and the last thing is for inflammation we've got some stuff coming out we have a video coming out soon on adhd and obesity which is like mind-blowing um but there's a lot of stuff there's some stuff in there about inflammation um gird is gastroesophageal reflux disease yeah this is a complicated question so what is the answer to this question yeah this is a complicated question so maybe we'll do i'll think about this and we'll talk a little bit about gut microbiome but it's complicated tldr but there are studies for some of this stuff let's just do a quick here we go so let's see let's let's learn together chat we're going to look at this thing and then we're going to call it okay because gird is very common let's look together gastroesophageal reflux disease and probiotics a systematic review published about four years ago so there should be some more data on this let's take a quick look um 13 prospective studies not bad okay so it looks like five high quality studies six low quality studies um so 11 studies 79 reported positive effects of probiotics on gird um so it looks like nausea was improved okay however proper placebo control controlled randomized and double blind trials with a sufficient number of participants are warranted to confirm the efficacy of its symptoms so it seems like if we look at a meta-analysis the takeaway is there are not great studies but that there seems to be a very noticeable effect my take as a clinician is that the effect not all probiotics are the same and um yeah but oh oh please ask all of to finish the trauma module map after with me okay so i have work to do it looks like i have some stuff to do in for the trauma module so i'm going to get to that because our awesome person trinian needs
