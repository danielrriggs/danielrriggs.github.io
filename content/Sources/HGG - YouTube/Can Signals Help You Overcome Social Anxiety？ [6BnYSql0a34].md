 So let's say I walk into a party and I'm feeling really anxious. What are the signals that I could perceive that would make me feel relaxed? If I saw other people looking at me and smiling at me and like waving me over, they're like, hey, look, it's Dr. K, Dr. K is here. Awesome. Like, hey man, thanks for coming. They can say all of those things, but I don't even need them to say it. If I walk in and I see other people and they smile and they wave me over, that will be socially reassuring. I may feel like I'm on the spotlight for a split second, but it'll feel very reassuring. And this is the problem is what do we do when we walk into a party and we feel socially anxious? We pull out our phones and we start looking at our phone and now our perceptions are locked into here. And if my perception is locked into here, how am I going to get all of those socially reassuring signals? How am I going to see that people, despite being near me, their body language is relaxed or excited or that they're smiling or they're trying to make eye contact? What all I'm going to do is I'm going to be kind of locked in over here.
