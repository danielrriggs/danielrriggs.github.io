 what a lot of people do in quiet quitting is they recognize that additional effort is not rewarded. So what used to happen is, okay, like there are four employees, and if you work hard, you will get promoted. And so then the default became everyone is working hard, but you still only get one person who's promoted. And so over time, what that sort of means is there's this interesting pressure where it creates like almost like a game theory kind of situation where I have to work harder than all of my colleagues in order to get promoted. But the harder my colleagues work, the harder I have to work to outpace them. So this system was happening and then employers realized everyone is working way harder than they are paid for. Then what started happening is I think employees started taking this for granted. So now we started getting things like unpaid internships are really low ball salaries and employers started to think like, oh, we can just low ball the fuck out of people because this is now the standard that happened so much that employers started taking this for granted. It's not even going above is no longer going above. Going above has become the norm.
