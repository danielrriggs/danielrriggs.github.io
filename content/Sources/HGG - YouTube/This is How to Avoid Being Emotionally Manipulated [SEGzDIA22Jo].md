 See, when you can't sit with your emotions, you end up out of control in your life. Because you don't control what you feel. You just control what you do when you feel something. And so if my whole life is lived in reaction to my emotions, other people get to control me. Because if they can evoke an emotion, they get to control my behavior. And this is what we feel like sometimes, right? So you get into these relationships, these toxic relationships, parents, significant others, friends, where they make you feel a particular way and they manipulate you. They're emotionally manipulative. But someone can only be emotionally manipulative if an emotion within you leads to a behavior. As long as that link is there, you can be emotionally manipulated. But the moment you are able to be with an emotion and not react to it, is the moment that you will be free of all emotional manipulation.
