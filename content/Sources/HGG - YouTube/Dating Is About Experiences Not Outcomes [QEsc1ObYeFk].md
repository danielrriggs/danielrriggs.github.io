 So this is the way that I want you all to think about dating. So in my life, I can be with someone, with a lot of people, with one person, with no people, you can pick whatever. And so you're going on a date to try to get to know someone, appreciate them for who they are, and see if you have some kind of natural inclination towards them. See if you all can vibe together or not. It's a vibe check. That's what a date is. So it's not about an outcome, it's about an experience. Not, I need to impress this person and this person needs to like me or anything like that. Let all that stuff go. You're going, you're going to show up as yourself. They are going to show up as themselves. You're going to be a polished version of you. And just try to enjoy the experience. This is the big thing that changed a lot for me. So it started with me being a monk. So I was like, okay, I'm going to be a monk. So now that I'm hanging out with girls, like there's no semblance of any kind of romantic anything. It's not an option. It's off the table. So I can relax and I can just have a good time. Let's just go hang out. Let's go to lunch somewhere. Hey, are you done? We're done with lunch. Do you want to like go do something else? Like, let's go for a hike. Then you end up hanging out with people and they wind up being a little bit more attracted to you.
