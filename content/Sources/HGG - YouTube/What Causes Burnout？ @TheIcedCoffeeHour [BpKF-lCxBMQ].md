 Burnout is caused by one thing, extreme effort with a lack of reward. So I'll work a 30 hour shift in a hospital and I'll be fine with it. Like that's like 30 hours, just think about that. I'll go to a hospital on Friday at 6 p.m. and I leave like Sunday morning or something like that. And this is normal for us as doctors and we don't burn out. What burns me out? When I have to talk to an insurance company to try to get approval for a medication for my patient. A 30 minute, 45 minute call where I'm sitting on hold with an insurance company creates more burnout than 30 hours of work. And so if you look at the science of burnout, what causes burnout is when someone tries something really hard, is invested in something and then they don't get it. So if you look at like content creators, why are they so burnt out? Despite all the success that you have, y'all know this, that there's always this voice in the back of your mind that you're never content.
