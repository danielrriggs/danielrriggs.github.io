 So let's tunnel down into, okay, what is social anxiety? Social anxiety is the concern of what other people think about you, right? That's what social anxiety is. I'm worried what other people are gonna think. Now, if I stopped worrying what other people thought, that would be freeing. That would be amazing. And the most important thing is that if I stopped caring what other people thought, I don't need loneliness to drive me to engage with other people. I can engage with other people through all kinds of other things. Like, hey, that person likes something that I like. That can drive me to form a connection with them.
