 So when you're trying to develop your vision of life, anything in your mind that is a goal, which is, by the way, how you've been conditioned to think, right? Promotion, this percentage of, you know, increase in salary, this kind of whatever, like it's always goals, goals, goals, goals, goals. I want to lose five pounds. That's different from I want to live a life of health, right? My body is a temple. What does that mean? Those are those vision kinds of statements that then you move towards in a particular way. And when you have a solid vision of your life, then people will sort of notice that in all of the actions that you do, because in pursuing that vision, you will start to align different parts of your life and people will be like, wow, that person is so organized. So how do we develop this vision? First thing that we do is we get rid of goals because there's nothing to do with goals. Second thing is that we want to really think about what are the ideals that you want to live your life towards and be as floofy and uncalculated as possible. All those thoughts that you've let go by the wayside because they're not useful and you can't achieve them in this world is something that you need to start to develop.
