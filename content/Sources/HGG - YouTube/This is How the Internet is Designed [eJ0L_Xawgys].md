 Why is shopping hard? Why does shopping take any more than 60 or 90 or three minutes, five minutes? It's because we browse. And when we browse, we buy crap we don't need. And why do we buy it? Because we browse and we're looking for crap that we don't even need. And that's how the website is designed. And I'm not saying that Amazon is evil, it's just how the whole internet is designed. The whole internet is designed for you to come in for one purpose and then for you to hang out for three hours doing crap that you don't need to do. But if I only have eight hours of technology, I can't afford to spend half an hour wasting my time browsing crap that I don't need. The other thing that I found is that my work became incredibly focused. So I do a fair amount of writing. And what I would do is sit down and like write everything out. This is my pile of papers from stuff that I do. So since I'm not allowed to use technology, I'll start work before 10. But I don't break my technology fast. So I'll like print things out and I'll like look over it. I'll collect all my thoughts. And then when I sit down to write, instead of writing for an hour and a half, that's a stream of consciousness that has to be edited later, I have all my thoughts collected. I write for like 20 minutes and I'm done. It's really bizarre.
