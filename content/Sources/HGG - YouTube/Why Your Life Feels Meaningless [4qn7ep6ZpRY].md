 We don't really understand like what matters, right? We have no experience of it. So this is essentially in a weird way it's almost like Dunning Kruger. So this is kind of like I remember when I was 13 years old my friends would talk about what the best like position is to have sex in. And it's like a bunch of virgins just like talking about this stuff and they would like argue with each other, right? They have no idea but we don't actually know what fulfillment is. I want to live a life that I want to live but I just don't see the purpose or point to anything. Yeah, I can help others and yeah it feels good when I do. I can try and maybe I actually help or maybe I don't. Maybe I fail, maybe I succeed. At the end of the day what does it all really matter anyway? What does it matter whether I live a happy life or a sad life? What does it matter whether I write an inspirational best-selling book or I just play video games all day? We're all just specks of dust on a rock whirling in space which is itself a speck of dust in an unfathomably vast and complex universe. We get to live for this brief window of time. What's the point of anything other than just maybe maximizing pleasure and minimizing gain? Before our time comes and it's over just like it is for every other mortal creature from the most revered among us to the lowly cockroach. How do people achieve a feeling that their life matters and feel a sense of fulfillment from what to do? Great question. So oftentimes we're in a position where we don't really understand what matters. We have no experience of it. So we ask these questions like how do I achieve a life that matters? How do I find a sense of fulfillment? But we don't actually know what fulfillment is because what is this person chasing? In the absence of actually understanding fulfillment what happens is their intellect comes up with all these different things. It comes up with like I'm completely insignificant on a cosmic level, which may be true. So what does it matter whether I do something or I don't do something? Because in the grand scheme of things what does it matter? Well that's a very good question. So this is where I think we have to start by sort of unpacking what does fulfillment even mean? Because what I tend to find in these sorts of situations is that when I don't, you know, existential, let's call it nihilism, when we're faced with existential nihilism here's kind of how it how the the sequence of things runs. Okay so we look at the world and we don't see meaning. No meaning, no fulfillment. Right? We're kind of looking around we're like I don't see the meaning here. And so then what happens is since we since it's not like apparent to us we start to become nihilistic and then in the absence of meaning we've got a void that we tend to fill up with pleasure seeking and pain avoidance. So in the absence of like fulfillment which is that dopaminergic like we're not really sure because when people talk about fulfillment they're not talking about things that are dopaminergic usually. What they're usually talking about is like something else that we don't really know what it is and so what we end up doing is like we don't see a clear road to it intellectually that is. And so what we do see and what we have experienced is like dopaminergic stuff so that's what we kind of do right we kind of fill it up that way. So what's kind of going on and this sort of results in essentially hedonism right? And so what this person is kind of saying is like in my mind I cannot logically discover fulfillment. So what I'm saying is like discover fulfillment therefore I'm going to default to hedonism. Okay so let's like start by sort of understanding if you want to find fulfillment how do we go about doing that like from a from a critical standpoint right? So let's start by understanding what is fulfillment right? So if you want to find something like if you want to like do something in life you have to start by like understanding how to go about what first of all what it is and if you know what it is then you can start to develop a plan to like find it right? But the first thing to understand like what is fulfillment? Like if I were to ask this person or I would ask you if you're nihilistic and I ask you what is fulfillment? I think what we're going to get is a shrug of the shoulders and it's in the absence of understanding what fulfillment is that we do this kind of thing okay? So this is essentially in a weird way it's almost like Dunning-Kruger. So when we lack understanding we fill it in with theory right? So I just want you all to think about and our society is moving it moving in this direction so our society is like moving towards the direction of like proxies instead of like true understanding. So this is why we use grades instead of knowledge when deciding like who to hire out of college right? It's why we use stock prices instead of fundamentals when evaluating the economy or companies and there are some people who do evaluate fundamentals right? So Berkshire Hathaway for example Warren Buffett like evaluates fundamentals and that's part of the reason that probably is so successful I'm not an expert in the stock market or anything so take that with a grain of salt but the key thing here is that our mind when we don't really understand something we'll just like fill it in with what logically we're able to produce. So this is kind of like I remember when I was 13 years old my friends would talk about what the best like position is to have sex in and it's like a bunch of virgins just like talking about this stuff and they would argue with each other right? They have no idea but they don't really stop and think a little bit about like they don't think about that right? It's kind of interesting because it's not like ignorance the ignorance of something prevents people from having an opinion in fact quite the opposite and this is where Dunning Kruger comes in so if I'm playing you know dota with like people who are 8k mmr and 2k mmr and no one knows their mmr the 2k player will be flaming the 8k player for not coming to fights that are stupid and irrelevant right? So that like we're gonna like we don't recognize when we're ignorant of something we just fill it in with like our random logic so then the kind of question becomes okay what are the tools at our disposal to understanding fulfillment? So if we want to like if we want to start this what how do we start? So let's start by understanding that we have two fundamental tools for understanding things we have experience and we have intellect okay? And generally speaking our society tends to emphasize intellect it tends to understand law emphasize logic and there's it's value to this there's no question about there being value but when it comes to something like fulfillment if I were to logically lay out an argument this is what fulfillment is it's not going to catalyze behavior it's not going to catalyze understanding so this is the other kind of interesting thing is that logic does not usually create behavioral change experience creates behavioral change and so what I'm hearing from this person is like you know if their struggle is why don't I just play video games all day versus try to write a best-selling novel that's a behavioral difference so the real problem with nihilism in my opinion is that like it doesn't dictate the right kind of behavior right what is the right kind of behavior we'll get to that in a second so let's start by understanding like what is fulfillment so like let me ask you all a question what do you think it's like to climb Mount Everest? What do you all think is the experience of climbing Mount or not the experience what do you think it's like? Do you think it's fulfilling? Right so I want you all to notice this for a second oh nope we got this or no okay oh there we go hopefully it'll populate so I want you all to kind of notice this that no one is saying I don't know right everyone is coming up with answers it's scary it's challenging it's cold so like notice what your mind does even in the absence of any kind of experience no one's like I don't know everyone's like it's must be this way must be this way must be so your mind is already like people are calling it exhilarating like I'm not going to do this so your mind is already like people are calling it exhilarating like your mind is already like coming up with answers for things that you have no idea about right it's really fascinating so what is fulfillment so like let's think a little bit so if we talk about Everest for a moment I imagine that climbing Mount Everest is fulfilling so it's kind of weird so when I say I imagine that what I'm going to actually talk about is climbing Mount Kilimanjaro which I have done so when I climb and you all are pretty right okay um and so like it's all of those things right so it's cold because your intellect is not poor it's not it's a good intellect you all are right it's hard some people are saying it's exhilarating right so I would I would say that climbing Mount Kilimanjaro was absolutely a fulfilling experience for me it gave some sense to meaning of my life and what I learned from it was kind of bizarre so I got to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro and like my first thought upon being on top of the world and the view is amazing because you're 20 000 feet up in the air and you can see like the African savanna like all around you and so it's bizarre it's like it's so weird to be you know the view you get from an airplane it's like that view but you can look 360 it's not secluded to a window and so it's amazing because you're 20 000 feet up in the air and when you see that my first thought was like all right let's go how quickly can we get down this is amazing and all but holy crap the first thing I want to do is get back down to the ground and so it was like such a bizarre experience and it sort of helped me understand and appreciate like yeah this was really amazing but I never want to do this again right and and so it's kind of bizarre but was that experience fulfilling I'd say absolutely was it all of these things as well absolutely this is what I want you all to understand is that the intellect can hypothesize these things but this is the tricky thing about the intellect is once you hypothesize an answer the intellect will say you don't need to bother because I have figured out what that experience is going to be like this is what's so dangerous about the intellect I don't need to bother I already know that and so the tricky thing about the intellect is that the intellect actually can keep your behaviors the same so it's going to say things like keep playing video games right like think about this for a second what do you think is the result what is this an argument for let's assume for a minute that there's a there's a covert argument in this and this is the justification that we use for playing video games all day right so I think that this person is like actually asking a really good question they're curious they're genuinely wanting to grow but there's like a subtle sneaky sneaky sneaky thing here going on which is this is basically saying don't bother doing anything let me just get my dopaminergic hit okay okay so let's try to understand a little bit about what fulfillment truly is now we're going to step to science for a second okay so first thing you've got to do is figure out what is fulfillment if you want to understand how to build a fulfilling life you have to start by figuring out what is fulfillment so now we're going to talk a little bit about video game addiction and the nature of fulfillment so so the reason that video games are addictive is not because they provide award or reward the reason video games are addictive this is an oversimplification but there's good good data behind this is actually because of the denial of the reward so this is really really important right so like everyone's playing elden ring now I'm still stuck on the first boss which is alarmingly hard I thought I was get good but I just haven't been able to get good right so what makes it so fulfilling like how does it feel to beat that boss I don't know right because I haven't done it yet so it's the denial of the reward followed by the reward that actually creates the sense of fulfillment in a video game this is really really important to understand and this is why games are so freaking addictive because they're going to deny you the reward for a time but you know that eventually you're going to get it it's the only place where the denial of reward has the guarantee of the reward after some amount of time that's why they're so addictive because what happens in wow right when there's like end game content like what happens three six months after the content gets released and all the hardcore raid guilds do it they nerf the content so you've wiped on this boss 15 times but don't worry the game devs have your back you're gonna you're gonna beat that boss eventually right whereas like dark souls doesn't do that so some people quit because there's no guarantee of the reward in dark souls and so game developers will even use this mechanic I don't think they really use it nefariously personally I think they're just like okay like we'll let the hardcore people do it and we want to have everyone have this experience I don't think that they're evil or diabolical about it but there's good data that shows that denial of reward is what makes game games addictive and if we think about adverse experiences or fulfilling experiences right we just talked about climbing mount kilimanjaro like a huge part of the fulfillment of climbing mount mount kilimanjaro was how hard it is so this is where adversity into success is a huge component of fulfillment right so we talked a little bit about Russia like overcoming video game addiction like like you know writing a best-selling novel is not about ego I mean if it's about ego that's totally fine but generally speaking I think when you write a really good novel or you create a good piece of I think when you write a really good novel or you create a good piece of work or like even as a doctor when I see a patient I do write by that patient that feels fulfilling like I feel really amazed with myself and I feel really good about myself after I work a call shift that's 30 hours because it's hard and I did a good job and I'm proud of what I accomplished but it's actually like the difficulty that leads to some of the the advantage so I remember many months ago I went hiking and I found like a bush of wild berries and like the berries were not nearly as good as what you get in the supermarket but damn were they so like satisfying I enjoyed them so much more than the objectively sweeter and tastier berry that you find from the supermarket so if we look at sort of the science of fulfillment what we tend to find is that adversity into success is a huge part of it right what are people proud of they're proud of things that they had to overcome we see video games take advantage of this and this is also where if we look at substance use we can see an element of this principle here as well so what makes a substance so satisfying it's actually the craving it's the denial of the thing so when I crave something right so I've worked with people who are like addicted to heroin and the worst their cravings get like they like want like it becomes so difficult and then when you finally use it feels so relieving and people who use like over and over and over again like they actually don't enjoy it as much as like if they've had cravings and then they use so when I talk to people who who relapse what they consistently tell me is it's like the first one or two uses when they relapse that are the best and after that they don't even enjoy it after that it feels awful it's kind of like playing a video game where like at the very beginning a video game is actually really really fun and it's when you sort of like get into it over and over and over and over and over again that your dopamine circuitry kind of adapts and then it's no longer fun right so this is why like I'm just to be clear I'm not advocating for usage of any of this kind of stuff I'm just using it to illustrate this point that adversity into success that denial of the reward followed by the reward can be incredibly satisfying now is that the nature of fulfillment I'm not sure okay so then the question becomes like okay how do I find fulfillment so this is this is the question you should ask and be careful because you can't you can ask this question intellectually you can answer it intellectually you can read a thousand books about finding fulfillment and will you have found fulfillment absolutely not right like you can watch as much pornography as you want to but no amount of watching pornography is ever a substitute for getting late and so this is what's happening in the world as we sort of get as we move towards higher and higher intellectual in the absence of experience we start to form like opinions about stuff and then we think we're right then we join echo chambers I mean echo chambers right and then when there are a thousand other people who are saying the same thing that we're saying when none of us have ever left the room then like we think we're more right because now we're getting congruence from the world because like everyone else believes what I believe so there's like no point in exploration because it's all been figured out the world is not a place to live in and it's not a place to be because it's all been figured out the world is nihilistic there's no point in doing anything just embrace hedonism disagree completely if you want to understand how to find fulfillment you have to first figure out what is the nature of fulfillment and now we're going to talk a little bit about sort of the yogic path now the yogic path is about awareness and simply what we want to do is look at ourselves through a series of experiences okay and just see like okay what is more fulfilling and what is less fulfilling so for example like eat while watching and eat and eat bites by yourself like without doing any any distracting no technology just eat the food which one is more fulfilling which one is more dopaminergic which one do you gravitate towards why do you gravitate towards it and which one does the food taste better right all right so you got y'all making a mistake once again no no no no no no no no everyone's giving answers this is intellect jumping in with answers don't do it you can't answer this right now this is the point you all need to understand this very very carefully right you notice how quickly your mind does this like this is the key thing do you all see this your mind is like i don't even know the answer so now what you've done is you remove the answer so now what you've done is you remove the necessity of actually engaging in the exercise because you already have the answer oh i know oh i know if you want to understand why you can't find fulfillment it is these three words oh i know i already know no need to explore i've read about it i've done it before do it with awareness sit down and actually do it okay and here's what what we're going to do so it's all about awareness so this is what i'd recommend if you want to understand the nature of fulfillment so you need to ask yourself like do i feel fulfilled but we're going to give you a couple of exercises first seek new things why is this this is because you already have answers for the existing stuff you can do so you can revisit like eating but i would seek something new so i would like if you haven't climbed a mountain before or even you know like i would go climb a mountain like if you've never been snorkeling before go snorkel okay second thing is embrace difficulty now this is the opposite of the hedonistic path remember the reason we're doing this is not just to make our life hard it's to try to understand the nature of fulfillment and so if you do something easy versus hard ask yourself which one is more fulfilling which one is more fulfilling going for a walk that is 50 steps is 50 steps or going for a walk that is 5000 steps which one is more fulfilling try it and this is the key thing this is why we get stuck because when we operate from hedonism we move away from difficulty and then when we move away from hardship we narrow the range of behaviors we can engage in so up here is hike cook camp games and down here is youtube games twitch we narrow the scope of our life and do we feel there's a thousand people millions of people out there that just do this all day are they fulfilled are the people that do this are they fulfilled once again you're going to want to answer right which is okay you have some experience but just be careful do an honest investigation and so i'm going to leave you all with one last exercise so this is do these two things to just find something new right and do it do it with awareness this is key so awareness is more than just like the experience of emotion so if you go do something you may be anxious and therefore you don't enjoy it we're not talking about enjoyment we're talking about fulfillment enjoyment and fulfillment are two different things that's why we have two different words for them and if you go down the hedonistic nihilistic route then you're going to shoot for enjoyment all the time and you'll find an absence of fulfillment and i've seen this like many many many times the classic story about this situation is actually the story of gotham buddha who had all of the enjoyments of the world and he woke up unfulfilled and i've seen this a lot with people who are you know financially well off and what they find is that like their life is not they have luxury and they have security which are absolutely important contributors to happiness there's been research on this right because it's hard to seek fulfillment when you are worried about putting food on the table and having a roof over your head so you should absolutely do those things first right we're not saying that those aren't important but it's just it doesn't stop there and this is where it in the yogic tradition there are four major goals of life life dharma artha kama and moksha duty wealth pleasure enlightenment so this is the cool thing i like this philosophy for this reason they're not saying don't enjoy things they're not saying don't get financial security right what they're saying is that you should do your duty first and then by all means you should get you should enjoy some amount of wealth right so get your financial security enjoy what life has to offer don't live like an ascetic if you want to eat a slice of deep dish pizza like eat a slice of deep dish pizza and you know for people who are curious this is the kam sutra this is even a religious text about like maximizing your pleasure which is like a part of the path and then at the end pursue enlightenment so like take what life has to offer don't deprive yourself of it but don't stop here this is the problem with hedonism is hedonism is like just this one right then there are the tryhards who are just this one but the truth is that i and once again this is from one particular tradition you guys don't have to accept this i personally i like it because it sort of says like yeah you should be spiritual you should do your duty you should be a good person but like you should enjoy life too like life is there to be enjoyed and so if we're talking about finding fulfillment look for it with awareness and so i'm going to give you all just one last option to get you started because awareness has to be cultivated it's not just like experiencing an emotion it's being fully aware of what you experience so what i'm going to ask you all to do is go for a jog okay so like health stuff aside so if you have any contraindications to this medically and things like that don't do this but i'd say go for a jog for 15 minutes make sure you hydrate a little bit ahead of time and then the first thing that you're going to want to do is drink water when you get back right what i want you to do grab a glass of water go sit outside and wait five to ten minutes and then see how fulfilling that glass of water is wait with it just watch yourself just watch yourself notice what happens like you're going to get these biological impulses you're going to feel thirsty you want the water you want the water you want the water and just you know obviously if you're like dehydrated it's very hot outside or don't do anything that's like dangerous like then drink the water but just watch the other thing that you can do is meditate in a hardcore way what does this mean so i'm going to teach you all the first step to hardcore meditation okay so the first step to hardcore meditation is to sit somewhere and not meditate so find find a place to sit that's relatively comfortable and don't do anything don't engage in like thinking like don't like start thinking about something don't create stories in your head don't think about what you're going to be doing later don't let yourself do anything if you want to try to meditate you kind of can but just sit somewhere for 10 minutes and watch what happens to you observe all of the impulses that happen right so there's a great exercise which is watch stare at a wall so some people have done this even up to an hour and it's going to be so incredibly difficult because what's going to happen what's going to happen is like your dopaminergic brain is going to be like i need something i need something i need something give me give me give me give me give me give me give me give me give me bored yes do you know what is the most frightening thing in the world to most people is boredom what is there to be afraid of in boredom it's 10 minutes what are you going to do in that 10 minutes otherwise browse reddit look at a meme what do you have to lose and see how quickly your mind rebels this will teach you awareness once you have awareness you can do it in 10 minutes will teach you awareness once you have awareness engage in activities and ask yourself what is the nature of fulfillment because how the hell are you going to find fulfillment if you don't understand what it is in the first place and this is why everyone's stuck because everyone's like oh like how do i find fulfillment like what's the point in anything like why should i do anything it's like you don't even understand what you're looking for all you're doing is substituting whatever logic or intellect you have for any kind of understanding understanding of experience and then half the time when your logical mind is telling you to do things it's actually hijacked by a subconscious like dopamine addiction so all it's trying to do is like ah there's no point in anything guess i'm going to play more games today because that's life guess i'm gonna play games oh no right now i'm gonna do it guilt-free because what's the point what's the point of anything why bother man look look at this look at how scientifically valid this is we're all just specks of dust on a rock whirling in space which itself is a speck of dust in an unfathomably vast and complex universe what does it matter if i start working on my term paper today in the grand scheme of things it's all irrelevant so when it's irrelevant what do you actually end up doing let me watch watch something on youtube for a little bit just today because in in the complete absence of meaning that your mind creates your addictions are unrampant right it protects you no guilt bro forget about the guilt don't beat yourself up for procrastinating it doesn't matter you can keep doing it there's it doesn't matter man a thousand years from now 10 000 years from now what difference does it make whether you start your term paper today or tomorrow how's it going to impact the grand scheme of humanity so be careful about where your thoughts lead you be careful if you find yourself it's a good question to ask like where does fulfillment come from why shouldn't i just be hedonistic and this is where i'd say like sure i could give you all sorts of answers like oh like you have such a powerful impact on the world man like try to be a good human being forget about all that let's let's be a little bit yogic about it let's follow the the path of the yogis and ask yourself first what is fulfillment define it like what the hell is it define it like what the hell is it then we can figure out how to like find it we have to know what we're looking for first how do we do that be careful about your intellect which is going to want to give you answers in as substitutes for taking actions very tricky so seek new experiences embrace adversity so ideal that those experiences are not like super easy and then do it do so with awareness and if you start doing these things you will understand the nature of fulfillment i also had one other exercise which i'll leave you with which is to find a moment of pure happiness and understand what are the components that are requisite for pure happiness and the only way you can do that is to study happiness in all of its different shades and the answer that i discovered was mind-blowing about the true nature of happiness but you can't i could tell it to you but then you won't explore your mind will come up with answers right now it's saying oh it's this it's this it's this it's this but remember this is like it's like tasting a strawberry like you can talk about it you can learn about neuroscience you can you know watch other people eat it all you want to but you're never going to taste it yourself until you actually like take a bite of the strawberry so try to find for yourself this is hard find a moment of pure happiness and understand what are the prerequisites for it yeah you want to know it now right so let's think about this if you're saying i want to know it now what happens if you learn it now what does your mind get to avoid if you understand the answer if i tell you the answer what do you get to do right you don't have to bother because the thing is it's hard so the harder it is the more you want to like you know get a helicopter ride to the top of the mountain like you don't need a helicopter ride if you're climbing to the second floor of your house you need a helicopter ride if you're going to the top of everest right so be careful about what your mind wants the harder it is the more your mind is like i don't want to why can't we just play games sit in front of a wall and stare at it no i don't want to just tell me what i'm going to learn anyway so that i can be intellectually satisfied and i don't have to change anything about my life if you want life to be good i don't know how else what other word to use generally speaking hopefully it'll be easier it doesn't mean that it's free of pain right just understand yourself man or woman or anything in between just understand yourself and how the hell you work just understand that and like life becomes so much more manageable not saying that it's all because remember like if fulfillment and enjoyment are two different things that means that you can live a fulfilling life that is absent of enjoyment that's true too that's what victor frankl figured out he's like oh being a holocaust in a concentration camp sucks and yet i can find fulfillment and meaning so the two are actually like somewhat independent right when you talk about the science of it there's more relations there right so we know that security and a certain amount of financial stuff we know that for example commutes over 45 minutes for married couples lead to sharp increases in divorce rates right so there are like all kinds of interesting factors that we know from science which you should absolutely take advantage of but don't use logic and intellect as a substitute for experience and be careful about how your mind tries to like dodge all kinds of stuff that is good for you because that's why you're stuck right because you're like listening to your mind you
