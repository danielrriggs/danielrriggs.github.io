 So, egoless intellect is how to make good decisions in life. That's what should be in control. You can even acknowledge that, hey, I'm disadvantaged in these particular ways. But when your ego is out of the picture, disadvantages become problems to be solved, not reasons to quit. This is the huge difference. Do you all get that? This is like night and day in terms of whether you put your life together or you don't put your life together. When disadvantages become reasons to quit, then you're going to stay stuck. When you step away from your ego, they become problems to solve. They become paradoxically not things that make it impossible for you to proceed, but they become your order of operations for putting together your life. I can't get this job because of reasons A, B, and C. Well, we're going to start with A, then we're going to fix B, then we're going to fix C. You can't get the job, but the individual components you can actually fix. Why don't we approach it that way? Because of our ego. Because there's a part of us that says you can't fix them anyway. You've tried and failed. You're a failure.
