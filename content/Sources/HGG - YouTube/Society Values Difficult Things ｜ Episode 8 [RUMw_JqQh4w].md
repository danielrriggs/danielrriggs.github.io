 But if you look at society, human beings throughout history have valued things that are difficult. So like, you know, if you meet the mayor of a city versus the president of the United States, there's people in general, I mean, hopefully I can use that example like a few years from now. But generally speaking, we value people who accomplish hard things, right? And so there's something in our brain that gets a lot of gratification from completing a hard task. And this is what we want to do for our kids, right? We want to encourage them to like feel proud of getting an A, and they do feel proud of getting an A. We encourage them to value overcoming difficulty and succeeding. So what a video game does, so the interesting thing about a video game, I read a fascinating paper which talked about the reason that video games are addictive is not because of the reward, but because of the denial of a reward. So if you think about a video game, you know, they're not easy, right? If they're easy, they're no fun. So if you really talk to people about what they enjoy about playing the video game, especially something like Fortnite. So a Fortnite is a game where like 100 people fight against each other in an arena, and there's only one winner. So 99% of the time, statistically, you're going to lose at Fortnite. And that's why it's addictive. Because that 1% when you are king of the hill, your brain doesn't differentiate between graduating from medical school and winning a game in Fortnite.
