 If I have some kind of negative emotional experience, processing it while I'm conscious will be painful, right? So if I got like bullied by someone and I start thinking about the bullying or process the bullying during the day, all of that pain will arise. So our brain has learned a really interesting evolutionary thing, which is, hey, we're gonna actually process emotions while you're zonked out. And you may have noticed this as well, that if you go to bed one night and you're kinda upset, oftentimes you will feel better in the morning. So the question is, hold on a second, where did those negative emotions go? Why do you feel better? Is it just because you're rested and your brain has like sort of cleared adenosine? It's actually way more than that. There's this emotional processing going on, which people kind of coined as de-learning because it's kind of getting rid of stuff.
