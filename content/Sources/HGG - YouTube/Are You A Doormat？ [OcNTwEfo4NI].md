 Once we have an identity of I don't have a lot of value as a human being, now what happens is we become dependent on the responses of others to pump ourselves up. So on a weekend, if I spend three hours doing something for myself versus spend three hours picking up someone up for the airport, and then that friend from the airport, which by the way, they never give me a ride, which is okay, right? Because I'm okay making sacrifices. That's worth more. And our friend says, hey, thanks so much for giving me a ride today. He really helped out. And we're like, oh my God, that feels so good. Oh my God, so good. Oh my God, give it to me. Tell me I'm worth something. I need it from you because I can't get it from myself. And then when they don't reciprocate, we feel bad. And what do we do to counter that feeling of badness? We construct this identity of like, I'm going to sacrifice. And that's what makes it okay. So when other people walk all over me, I'm going to cognitively reframe that as sacrifice. And then I'm going to feel good about myself. And then think about what you've done. You've created a dynamic where for you to feel better about yourself, someone has to take advantage of you.
