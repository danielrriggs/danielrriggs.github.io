 Yeah, I think it's a mistake that a lot of people are told like, hey, you're so close, like you have so much potential, if you just push yourself, you'd be amazing. And they never do. I think they need to be told like, hey, you're actually dumb as bricks because you're unable to execute your potential. Yeah. So you know, it's interesting because that is very effective. Like so just from a psychological perspective, what I'm understanding is if we say that ego, right, the preservation of an identity that you are smart is what short circuits someone's ability to actually try. If you call them dog, what you're doing is removing ego from the equation. And now they have free range to try. It's actually really elegant. My take is a little bit different. It's unprofessional for me to call people dog. I think it would hit really hard in the button down. You call someone dog in the button down. They're like, oh my God, I think it would hit hard. Yeah, maybe too hard. I'll ask people because I think a lot of times when everyone's like, oh, like you could like you should live up to your potential, you should try really hard. No one ever asks them, what do you want? It's not about what you should or shouldn't do. It's like, what do you actually care about? And then work towards that.
