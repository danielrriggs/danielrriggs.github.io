 So clarifying question, I know a lot of these games are designed to spike dopamine, designed to create craving. What is the difference between craving and addiction? Yeah, so I think craving could be a feature of addiction. I mean, I had a breakfast taco for breakfast this morning and I had a craving for a breakfast taco. Am I addicted to breakfast tacos? My wife may say yes, I would say no. So a craving is just a feature of the brain. Like we can crave all kinds of things. And addiction, what we really think about is where do I draw the line between is my kid addicted or is my kid not addicted? That's where I come down to impairment of function. So if the gaming is interfering with your physical health, if it's interfering with your mental health, if it's interfering with your relationships, causing problems in your marriage, with your kids, with your parents, with your significant other, we've seen that a lot. If it's causing problems professionally or academically, what we really look for is that impairment of function.
