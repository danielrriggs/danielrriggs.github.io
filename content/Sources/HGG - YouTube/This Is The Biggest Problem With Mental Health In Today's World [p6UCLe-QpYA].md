 We have a mental health crisis, but underneath the mental health crisis, honestly, we have an economic crisis. We have a generation of young people who cannot work hard to achieve satisfaction or security. That's the biggest problem with mental health right now, was that if your life sucked and you were depressed, like 100 years ago or 50 years ago, let's say 50 years ago, you could do something to change it. How hard you work changes the circumstances of your life. The challenge right now that honestly that I see is that you can work really hard and like it's not clear that that will actually substantially improve things. That you can't pay effort for security anymore and that's devastating. It's not even about money, it's about security.
