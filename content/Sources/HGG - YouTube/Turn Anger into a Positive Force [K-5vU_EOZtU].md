 Now how do you develop a healthy relationship with anger? Start by understanding that all emotions exist for a reason. So if you can't forgive yourself for being angry, because that's what a lot of people will try to do at the very beginning, understand that emotions are information. And start by asking yourself, what is the anger telling me? Because if we don't want to judge ourselves for being angry, we have to understand it, we have to listen to it. Doesn't mean follow what it wants you to do. Listening to it means literally listening to it, or not, I guess, metaphorically listening to it. It doesn't mean following its direction. Because anger, like why have human beings, all human beings are capable of exhibiting anger, feeling anger? Why is this conserved through human evolution? It's because anger is a useful emotion. And the place to start if you have a judgmental relationship with anger is with information and understanding. So oftentimes anger manifests as a sign of something like disrespect. As you start to feel angry instead of suppressing it, ask yourself, what am I angry about? What is the anger telling me? And then you may find something that's really, really important, which is that, oh, I'm being disrespected.
