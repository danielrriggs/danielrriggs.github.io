 The problem is that we become overly outcome focused. And the main thing is that we become unintentionally outcome focused. We've started to be controlled by outcomes. And this is where, if you wanna be an artist, what I would recommend to you is that you don't try to become a best-selling artist. What you try to do is make the best book. And that's a subtle, but very important difference. So write the best goddamn book you can. Paradoxically, it's the people who worry about becoming best-selling authors that have the hardest time becoming best-selling authors. And it's the people who don't try to become best-selling authors and focus on writing the best goddamn book that they can that wind up as best-selling authors. Now you may have to make some adjustments and stuff based on like markets and stuff like that. So I'm not saying you're ignoring all that stuff. But generally speaking with artistic pursuits, the best games are gonna come not out of like formulaic understanding of things, but someone who's like, I wanna play a game where I can do this.
