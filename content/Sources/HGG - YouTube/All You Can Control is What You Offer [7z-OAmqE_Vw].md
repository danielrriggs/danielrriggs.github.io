 So if you're having trouble with a presentation, think about what you have to offer, not about what they think or what they will think or how you'll look, because that's not why you're there. So even today, oh my God, how do I know if I can answer the questions? I don't know if I can answer the questions. What if I give the wrong answer? What if I give the bad answer? That's a problem and I can learn from it, but I'm here to offer what I have. That's it. And that's what I focus on. It makes it really easy. Hey, I'm giving you all a presentation today about the French Revolution. And in these next 20 minutes, I've read hundreds of pages around the French Revolution, and in these next 20 minutes, I can boil down what the French Revolution was about, why it was important, how it started, and what we can learn from it. That is even applicable today. That's how you put together a presentation. Think about what you have to offer, not what people will think, and then offer it 100% authentically. And if they don't like it, they don't like it. You can't control that, right? You can't control what people like and don't like. All you can control is what you offer.
