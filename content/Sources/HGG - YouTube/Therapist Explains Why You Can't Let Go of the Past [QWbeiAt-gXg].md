 We try to like hold on to the memory of who we were because things in when you're a teenager can be sort of bright and fun and then when you're 20s sort of roll in you can lose sight of that bright hopeful person you used to be and then we sort of try to hold on to that person. That person used to be like excited to do things they used to be excited about the future and then when we have setbacks we sort of lose sight of our positive self and then we're kind of left with this vacuum of not being internally motivated because that person feels like they're gone and all of my motivation came from that person. Then what we try to do is we try to figure out okay how am I supposed to navigate now like if I don't know who I am and then what we do is we cling to our image of former self that person back when they were 20 years old would have done this.
