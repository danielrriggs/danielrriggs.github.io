 why men are oftentimes not attractive. So one is that we're not conditioned to it. I think a second thing that tends to happen with men is that people don't compliment men's appearances very often. I grew up in a time where any kind of positive affection or even comment in the physical realm about another dude labeled one as homosexual. So I grew up in a highly homophobic environment. Heaven forbid you say that a dude looks attractive, like, oh my God, that means that you're gay. Oh my God, we can't have that. The other thing that tends to happen is that men don't get compliments. So we don't feel attractive. And if we never get positive reinforcement, we're not going to go out of our way to look attractive. And part of the reason that we never get compliments, it's not just women's fault or other men's fault. It's because frequently we as men get confused when someone compliments us. This person is complimenting my appearance. When I compliment someone's appearance, that means that I'm attracted to them and want to sleep with them. So if they are complimenting my appearance, that means that they must want to sleep with me.
