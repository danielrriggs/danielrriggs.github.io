 You know, everyone's worried about the impacts of AI on mental health. And there are definitely cases where people have like emotionally leaned on AIs to the point where things get kind of crazy towards the end. And there's evidence that shows that basically the the more you talk to an AI, the deeper you go into a conversation, the weirder the AI becomes. So the first five questions that you ask an AI about your mental health will be like pretty okay. But then if you ask 50 questions, 52 questions, 53 questions, the deeper into a conversation you go, the less data the AI has. Because all these AIs are trained on the internet, and the internet is usually surface level conversation. So people will sort of worry about that. But actually the impact that I'm the most concerned out in terms of AI and mental health is not some hypothetical impact, but is the very real impact of how AI affects people's jobs and livelihoods.
