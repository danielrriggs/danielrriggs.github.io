 So the problem with the millennial generation is that we were sold a formula for success that did not work. So when I was growing up, they all said, go to college, get a degree, go to graduate school, you'll be special. And then with this thing behind you, don't worry about student debt, by the way, with all the stuff behind you, you're going to be successful. But what had happened is everyone had sort of figured out, at least in the US, that everyone's going to college and everyone's taken out loans and 18 year olds don't understand the value of a dollar. So we're just going to keep on jacking up loans and education prices and loans and education prices. And they even passed legislation in the United States that you cannot declare bankruptcy and get rid of your student loans. Corporate malfeasance? You ran your bank into the ground? You can declare bankruptcy. Commercial real estate? You can wipe that debt clean, baby. Let's go. You can wipe all the debt clean you want, except for student loans. That's the one thing we're going to saddle you with no matter what. So this generation, my generation, got screwed.
