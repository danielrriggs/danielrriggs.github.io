 I think the main thing to understand is that the happiness that comes from security is what money buys. Absolutely. Yes. The challenge is that for a long time when we're unhappy, we believe, and this is true, right? That like more money and more stuff will make us happy. Like, oh, I want a, I want to buy this game and I can't afford the game. And then I get the game and now I have the game and now I'm happy. So our whole life, we actually learn that getting stuff will make us happy. But the problem is all of the happiness of those things is temporary. And it never ends. Until you learn how to appreciate what you have. You can have one piece of jewelry and then you can still like appreciate it on a daily basis. But that requires like a cultivation of appreciating what you have as opposed to chasing something else. And appreciating what you have, that's just eventually learned? No, you have to learn it. You have to learn it. I mean, I think the people who are lucky eventually learn it. But I think the sad thing is that a lot of people don't. A lot of people don't learn that though, right? They don't, yeah.
