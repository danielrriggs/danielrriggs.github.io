 The problem is until we start questioning our perception, then the cycle of depression will continue because the inputs we're getting that are making us depressed are not actually accurate. They are distorted in some way. And since they're distorted, we see the world in a negative light. Then we draw conclusions about the world. Our mind loves to overgeneralize. Then we draw conclusions about ourselves. And then once we believe that we are not good, then all kinds of problems will arise. The question is, how do you short circuit this? The way you short circuit it is by actually training your perception. So if we can look out for these cognitive biases, the selection bias, the interpretation of ambiguity as negative, and the overgeneralization, it will change literally the way that you see the world. And once the world becomes a different place, it is way easier to be less depressed.
