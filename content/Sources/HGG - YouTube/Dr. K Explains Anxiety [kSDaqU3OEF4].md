 And so what do you do as someone who's anxious? You try to control the situation. Because if you can control the situation, your anxiety will come down anyway. I'm afraid someone is gonna break up with me. They could break up with me. This is a real situation. My anxiety is high. How do I fix this? I'm going to get them to promise never to break up with me. I'm going to engage in behaviors to bring down, to control the situation. Because if I can control the situation, then the anxiety will come with it. You see, these two things are tied. And so what do people with anxiety do? They try to control the world around them. Controlling the world around you is difficult, arguably impossible. And if you can't control your partner or your boss or your professor or your friends or your parents, what do you do? You keep trying in your head over and over and over again. And why do you never solve your problems? You never solve the problems because it's someone else. You can't control another human being. Then why don't you quit? Why do you keep trying to solve the problem? Because that is the survival mechanism that you learned. Right? That is anxiety in a nutshell.
