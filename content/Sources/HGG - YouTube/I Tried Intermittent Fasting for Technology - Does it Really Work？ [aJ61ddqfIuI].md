 So we're about one week in into intermittent fasting for technology, and the experience has been really interesting. So the first thing that I kind of noticed is like how much time I waste on technology, and being able to really like restrict technology usage to eight hours a day has completely changed the structure of my day to day. I try to spend at least one hour a day outdoors, and what I found is that actually instead of just like waking up in the morning and like sitting down at the computer and figuring out what I need to do for the day, which is usually what used to happen, I would sit down, like look at my calendar and like just try to figure out, check my email, check Slack. I used to just spend an hour or two just like checking stuff without actually doing work. And what I found now is that what I'll usually do is since I don't want to break my fast, I'll come outside with a piece of like paper and a pen, and I'll actually just think a little bit about, okay, what do I want to accomplish today? Like what do I need to do? And so rather than having like the internet or technology prompt me about what's important, I start to spend time really like thinking about, okay, like this is what I need to accomplish today.
