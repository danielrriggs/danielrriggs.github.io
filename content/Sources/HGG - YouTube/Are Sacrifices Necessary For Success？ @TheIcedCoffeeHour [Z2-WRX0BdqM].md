 almost everyone who's really ultra successful has said this, that you need to give something up to focus on the one thing if you want to succeed at it. Maybe that means you can't have the social life that you want to, maybe it means- Sleep a lot of the time is a pretty big sacrifice. You could sacrifice sleep. I mean, there's a lot of things that you could give up in favor of pursuing an outcome that is greater than the average. What's the point of pursuing an outcome? Desire of that outcome. Okay, so I mean, I think if your goal is desire of an outcome, then by all means make sacrifice. What I have found in my life is that the fewer sacrifices that I make, the more successful I become. Relentlessly pursuing a desire can absolutely come with a lot of sacrifice, but I don't think that's the only way to reach success. You know, I don't make many sacrifices now. In a sense, I make a lot, but they don't feel like sacrifice. I just make choices, that's all it is. You can't make a sacrifice unless you're attached to something, does that make sense? When you can enjoy writing a book just as much as you enjoy playing a video game, are you making a sacrifice by not playing the video game? No.
