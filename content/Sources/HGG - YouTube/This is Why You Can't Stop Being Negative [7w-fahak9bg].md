 The thing about people with rejection sensitivity is their brain is wired to interpret neutral stimuli as negative. And their brain is wired to discount positive stimuli. And their brain is wired to amplify negative stimuli. So you have a filter that doesn't let you see the good, turns the neutral into bad, and amplifies the negative. And that's how you arrive at the conclusion that these people don't like me. It's because you're literally ignoring 70% of the information. And that's like scientific. That's like literally what happens in the brains of people with rejection sensitivity. They've done studies on this stuff.
