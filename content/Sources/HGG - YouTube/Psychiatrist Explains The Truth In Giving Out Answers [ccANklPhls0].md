 So, Fallon Artorias is saying by not giving them the answer, you're actually giving them the answer. So here's the key thing to understand about giving people answers. Is giving people answers doesn't fix problems. Discovering answers fix problems. So what coaching really is, is a process of facilitated discovery. If I want to learn math, and I go to a math tutor and I say, I don't know what 4 plus 7 is, and the math tutor says 4 plus 7 is 11, you say, ah, I have the answer. You jot it down, you get the homework right. But you never learn math. If you actually want to learn math, you can't get the answer from someone. What someone needs to do is teach you the tools to find the answer. And they kind of understand, right? Okay, so what this person needs is addition. I need to teach them addition. So that's what's like so tricky about this is that they have to understand, okay, do we need addition? Do we need multiplication? Do we need division? And then they'll facilitate your movement in a particular direction.
