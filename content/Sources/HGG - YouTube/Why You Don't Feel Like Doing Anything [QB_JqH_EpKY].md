 When we say, I don't feel like it, which part of our being does that relate to? And it turns out that it's actually emotions, right? So you don't really notice that you don't have an emotion, right? It's kind of, I just don't feel like anything. You sort of feel emotionally neutral. And what is feeling? Feeling is an emotion. And so now the question kind of becomes what determines your emotional state in response to a task, right? Because if we don't feel like it, we have to cultivate the right kind of motion. So even though this scenario is exactly the same, our emotional response can change depending on our perception of self. So depending on how I think about myself. So if I think of myself as I enjoy dancing, then my emotions, when it comes to dancing, will be positive in nature, exciting in nature. And if I think of myself as not a good dancer, I don't know how to dance. Then my emotions will be negative and I won't feel like doing it. Literally the difficulty of getting on the dance floor depends on the emotional response that I have and the emotional response that I have depends on my sense of identity.
