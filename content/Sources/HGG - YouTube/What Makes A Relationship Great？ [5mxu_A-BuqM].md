 So you sacrificing for the sake of your partner is not toxic or non-toxic. The only thing that makes it toxic or not is whether your partner is willing to do the same for you. And the best relationships are when I am willing to put someone ahead of me, and they are willing to put me ahead of them. And when both of us prioritize the other person, then it's actually really healthy. It's great because now you have someone who cares about you more than they care about themselves. And that person's like on your team. That's awesome.
