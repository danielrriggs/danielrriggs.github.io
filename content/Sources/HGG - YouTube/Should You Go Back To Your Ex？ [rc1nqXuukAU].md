 Someone's asking, what do you think about getting back together with your ex? So here's what I'd say, not knowing anything about the situation. Let's talk about exes for a second. You should only get back together with your ex if both of you are committed to working on the problems that made you exes. It's not about them having changed or you having changed. Both of y'all have to be committed to fix whatever crap caused y'all to break up in the first place. And if people are committed to that change, then it's not a bad idea, knowing nothing else about the situation. But if people aren't committed to that change, then you're in trouble.
