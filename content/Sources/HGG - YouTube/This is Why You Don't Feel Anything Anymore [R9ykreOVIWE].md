 So alexithymia is the inability to experience your internal emotional state. And what I kind of view this as is almost like an emotional colorblindness. We don't really realize, but a lot of our problems actually come from an inability to experience our internal emotional state. And there's actually a lot of science that shows that being unaware of what you're feeling can lead to all kinds of problems. So alexithymia has been associated with problems with motivation and finding direction and purpose in life. And alexithymia is also a culprit for problems in relationships. When we don't understand what we're feeling, it creates all kinds of stresses in relationships. We start to send mixed signals because someone asks us, hey, is it OK if I go to this party without you? And you're like, yeah, it's fine, like, whatever. And then you kind of feel resentful, but you don't know how to vocalize that resentment. And so as a result, it kind of sabotages your relationship because you said it was OK, but now you're punishing this person for something that you gave them permission for.
