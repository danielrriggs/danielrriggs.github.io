 The second reason that people plateau in therapy is because we go to therapy and we do what we think therapy is. So when I go into therapy, I'm supposed to go there and talk about my problems. And that's sort of what we do in therapy, but sometimes that actually doesn't work. So if you kind of think about it, you know, we have a bunch of people on the internet nowadays who will trauma dump. And we have a bunch of people who are emotionally needy. And you may have someone in your life who's kind of like this, where every single time you talk to them, it's the same kind of record that's getting played over and over and over again. We're listening to the same complaints on repeat. I feel so insecure about myself. I'm always going to be alone. Everyone in the world hates me. It's kind of this like this sort of endless source of emotional venting. And sometimes when people come into therapy, that's what they think therapy is. Hey, I'm supposed to talk about my problems, right? So here I'm going to share all of this sadness and this loneliness and all this kind of stuff. And if I share it over and over and over again, eventually it'll get better. But that's not actually how it works.
