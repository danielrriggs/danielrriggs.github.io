 So the big irony is when you start losing your mind, you were afraid that if you go to a therapist, you will confirm that you have lost your mind. Because who goes to therapists? People who are crazy. Yeah, which is just unfortunate that's the stigma. Yeah, you're losing your mind. You don't want to be losing your mind. Crazy people go to therapy. And the big irony is that when you go to therapy, what you discover is that you're actually sane and that you've been sane all along. Yeah, it's bad, but you wouldn't know that until you go there and you're resistant to go there because you don't want to admit it. And so it's frustrating. It's really bizarre, but I've never heard it phrased that way. But it's beautiful that that therapy is actually where you discover how sane you are, not when you discover how crazy you are. And the big irony, the really sad thing is that people feel crazy, but they're actually way more sane. Yeah, like, you know, it's like mentally like the stuff that's going on there, you need to unpack. It's like going to your doctor, ultimately, you know, you just need to go to the doctor to try and work something out, you know.
