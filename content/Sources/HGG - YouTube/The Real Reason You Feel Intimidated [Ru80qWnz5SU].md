 Actually, the reason that you feel intimidated is because you are capable of what the other person is. You just need to make some changes. And in the short term, one thing that you can really do to avoid that retreat and avoid getting trapped in your own head is just express appreciation towards that person. Even if it's a little bit uncomfortable for you, certainly makes their day, right? So like that's pretty cool. And acknowledge that, hey, I really appreciate this thing. That's why I feel intimidated. You don't have to share that, right? So you just walk up to them and say, hey, I really appreciate this. Follow it up with a question. And if they choose not to engage with you, because maybe they're embarrassed by the positive feedback and they don't know what to say, then you can say, hey, I just wanted to share that. Thank you so much. It was a great presentation. It was nice to meet you. And then you walk away. And even if that is scary, you can go through this introspective process of recognizing, okay, what do I see in this other person? And how can I take one step towards that? Don't try to become the other person, but what can I do? Just one step forward. That'll help me move towards this goal because I know I'm capable. If you didn't know you were capable, you wouldn't be intimidated by it in the first place.
