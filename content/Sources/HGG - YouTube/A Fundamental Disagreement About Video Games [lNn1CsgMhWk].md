 And I think the other problem that we sort of see is that when you are emphasizing the dangers of technology to a parent, and then that parent goes and sits with their child, what does that conversation look like? You've got to stop playing the video game. Don't you realize how terrible it is? Oh my God, I just read this thing. There was this student who was playing this video game, and they got doxed, and they were stalked, and someone followed them. And so that paranoia and fear is front and center with the parent. Now when you sit down and you talk to your kid, how do you think your kid is going to respond to that? Do you think they're going to agree? Of course not. No, I play this game every day. There's nothing wrong with it. So from the very get-go, the parent is coming in with a completely different perception. And so parent and child are not on the same page. And then it becomes a push and pull, where I'm trying to convince you, no, it's okay to play a video game. I've been doing it my entire life. And the parent is like, no, no, no, it's not okay. So there's a fundamental disagreement.
