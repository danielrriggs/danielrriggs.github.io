 This is what really screws men. As men, we are socialized and conditioned to only feel anger. This is the only emotion you are allowed to feel as a man growing up. And this is the one emotion that gets demonized when you're older. So I'll give you a simple example. So when I get bullied in school, like what am I supposed to do, Stephen? In school, it depends if you can fight back. Absolutely. Like you didn't say, talk to the teacher. You didn't say, cry about it. Because if I cry about it, what's gonna happen, Stephen? You're gonna get bullied more. Absolutely. So men experience anger is something called an umbrella motion. We literally suppress and are conditioned to suppress all other emotions except for anger. And then if you talk to men about their experience of life, anger is always the first thing that comes out of their mouth. Someone breaks up with you, how do you feel about it? Do you feel ashamed? No, that's not what we say. I feel pissed off. How could she do this to me? And then we vent that anger on the internet, and then this turns into misogyny. The men who are saying these kinds of toxic things are saying that for a reason. This is because of their upbringing. This is because of the world that they lived in.
