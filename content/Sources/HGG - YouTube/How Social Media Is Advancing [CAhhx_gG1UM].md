 I think what's happening is these platforms are starting to get to know you way better than you know yourself. They can even tell what your psychological vulnerabilities are. And once they understand what your psychological vulnerabilities are, it really opens you up to a whole level of manipulation. Sometimes we have people like toxic parents who raised us so they know what our psychological vulnerabilities are. But even they are going to be flawed and you're going to grow and change as a person. So the kinds of emotional manipulation that your family did to you doesn't work as you grow up. Whereas these platforms will constantly be learning. Every day that you wake up and you look at it, you may change a little bit. You may be a slightly different person. And if you're a slightly different person, they'll keep up with that. And so they'll constantly be able to pace themselves to whatever you're psychologically vulnerable about. And then they will use it to sell you things. Products and services that will make all of your problems go away. Makeup that will make you more beautiful. Penis enlargement supplements that will make your penis bigger. All kinds of other things that will improve various parts of your life. Just buy this thing and we will fix the problem.
