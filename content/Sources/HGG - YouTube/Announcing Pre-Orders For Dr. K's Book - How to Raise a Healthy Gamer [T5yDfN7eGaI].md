 Hi, I'm Alok Kanodja, but the internet knows me as Dr. K. I'm a former gaming addict turned Harvard-trained psychiatrist. I started an organization, Healthy Gamer, that has now helped millions of gamers develop healthy relationships with technology. As Healthy Gamer grew, parents started reaching out asking for help. Hey, Dr. K, how do I get my kid to put down the game without it being a fight every single time? So, I wrote a book about it. How to Raise a Healthy Gamer combines the latest in neuroscience research along with a decade of clinical practice. And by the way, I'm also the parent of two amazing kids who love video games. The problem with gaming is that it tricks our brain into being a substitute for life. Once we start to get our psychological needs met through the game, that's when we become addicted. How to Raise a Healthy Gamer offers a step-by-step approach that is evidence-based to raise a healthy gamer. To help your child create a life that is worth living, that is full with all of its ups and downs so that gaming can be what it's supposed to be, a source of fun and recreation. So whether you're dealing with a kid who has a full-blown video game addiction or you're trying to prevent one in the future, How to Raise a Healthy Gamer can help.
