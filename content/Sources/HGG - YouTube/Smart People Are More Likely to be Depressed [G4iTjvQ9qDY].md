 The higher your IQ is, the more likely you are to be depressed. So if you look at the general population, about 9.5% of people are depressed. There are some studies where researchers have looked at the top 2% of people in terms of IQ. So they took the smartest 2% of people in the world and they assessed how depressed they are. And if you're in the top 2% of people, you have a 36.6% chance to be depressed. We're talking about a four-fold increase in risk of depression. Even though these studies have some methodological problems, there's some really interesting supporting evidence on sort of understanding why is it that smarter people are more likely to be depressed. A series of trials that really look at something called insight, which is your awareness of what your problems are. If you get diagnosed with something that's like really bad, like cancer, the awareness that you have, your ability to analyze and accurately assess your situation, correlates with suicidality. So the greater your insight is, the more aware you are, the more suicidal you are.
