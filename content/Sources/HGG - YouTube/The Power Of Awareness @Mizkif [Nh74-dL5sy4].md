 What's the emotion that comes with my ADHD is 10 out of 10? It can't get worse. It's like I'm joking, but I know it's like it hurts. Yeah, that statement is born of pain. Do you know what I hear when I hear that? I've suffered so much. It's been so hard to live my life. I've been struggling with this weight on my shoulders and it's every single thing I try to do. And anything that I've done successfully has been through sweat, blood, tears, luck. I've got a couple things that I'm good at and man, I have run those as hard as I can and every ounce of success has been like scraped together. It's all luck. There's that emotion. There's the joke. So even in that moment, you distract yourself from the negative emotion, right? Now there's some genuine. So you see the relief. This isn't a joke. Now this is, now you see it. This is the power of awareness. Now just feel it. That's hard. It is.
