 If you're struggling with a bad habit, what I would strongly recommend is that you engage in the habit with awareness. And this is also where you've got to be kind of careful because even if you screw up, even if you're not able to resist the piece of cake or using the cell phone or something like that, try to garner as much awareness as you can when you use it. Just notice, like look at it and say like, oh, wow, like I really want to use this phone right now. And it seems too hard to stop. So let me use it. It's OK. Or if you're trying to eat something, pause for a second and look at that piece of cake and be like, OK, I really want to eat this. Let's see how it tastes. And the cool thing is that as you do that over and over and over again, you will be strengthening this connection between your frontal lobe and your habit circuitry. And then you will discover this tipping point, which is exactly what happened to me. And this is why I decided to become a monk in the first place, because I struggled so much with video game addiction, all these bad habits. And I went to India and I was like, wow, this is amazing. Like suddenly things are becoming easier for me, controlling my own behaviors and my bad habits are starting to feel easy to handle.
