 So I'll give you an example, my favorite example from when I was in college and was terrible at dating. So, Aulok likes a girl. I'm Aulok, by the way, in this story. And Aulok wants to ask out a girl. And Aulok asks out a girl and girl says, no. Then I feel ashamed. But I'm not really aware of my emotions. But then what happens, I start making these statements to myself and to other people, to anyone who will listen. I'm not that into her, you know? Her loss. Self bullsh-t. Right? The self bullsh-t begins. Yep. Now, this is not like analytical. And so then literally what the ego does is it goes to your buddhi and it says, hey, bro, we're feeling bad. Give me a selective interpretation of this. Give me something that feels logical, that can help us feel better. So we're going to selectively ignore all the stuff that she's, I'm in love with her and she's amazing and all this kind of sh-t. And then just give us all, give us all the bad things about her. Because if we can put her down, we can feel better about ourselves. And then we don't have to feel ashamed of ourselves. This is how it works. Makes sense. Okay. I can see that.
