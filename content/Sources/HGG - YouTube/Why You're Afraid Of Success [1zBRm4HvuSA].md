 If you ask people who are afraid of success, like why are you afraid of success? They're like, I don't know. And then you ask them, Hey, in the past, when you've tried to put together your life, what ended up happening? I always screwed it up. So even then they succeeded. They got the job. They started dating someone. They went on their first date. They went on their second date and it always falls apart. And so then if you're someone who's lived like this, some part of you believes that even when other people succeed, you will screw it up. And then your brain, by the way, doesn't do things to screw you. Your brain works to help you. It's like, bro, you really want those like Doritos or whatever that like you're like hungry. Like I'm a, I'm a hook you up with like a 2000 calorie burger. Take care of that hunger. I'm going to take care of it for you, son. You're feeling bad about yourself. Like let's go look at pictures of your ex. I'm a help you feel like a piece of crap. That's what you want to feel like. Right. You're beating yourself up. I'm a help you when your brain fears success and fears failure. It's trying to protect you from the failure that is going to come after the success.
