 is games become more and more fun. How do they become more fun? It's because developers figure out, okay, we can scratch like another psychological need. And so if you think about games like now, there's like appearance and cosmetics, right? So we all want to look good. And since it triggers that sense of fun, what that sort of means is activating that circuit, the circuit that we have to want to be respected, to want to look good, except now we can sort of satisfy it within a video game. And what we're starting to see is that like, we can kind of satisfy some of these psychological needs in video games, although they're not like a complete satisfaction, but it's kind of enough. What's sort of happening is people are like starting to live their lives more and more like in the virtual world. And as they do that, they start to kind of get disconnected or fall behind in the real world.
