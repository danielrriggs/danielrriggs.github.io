 Urge surf. So urge surfing is a technique that we use in addiction psychiatry to help people withstand the cravings to substances that they're addicted to. And the general principle is that if we look at the mind urges or cravings arise, but if we're able to tolerate that for some amount of time, if we're able to surf on top of the urge instead of give into it, over time that urge will actually go away. So what we want you to do is just surf on top of that urge. Notice the craving and just don't give into it, right? What we're asking you to do, remember that following through is about doing something consistently, but what y'all may be way better at is doing nothing, right? That's so much easier to do. It's not actually because resisting a craving is difficult, but some of us are pretty good at doing nothing. We're pretty good at procrastinating and that's what urge surfing really is. No cravings will last forever. That's a natural tendency of the mind.
