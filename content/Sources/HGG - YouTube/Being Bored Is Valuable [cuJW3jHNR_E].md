 So in order to gain control of your wants, you need two things. One is meditation. The second is the tolerance of boredom. Once you learn to be bored, now just think about this for a second. Think about the value of being bored. If you no longer have to retreat from boredom, do you need to use your phone? No. Do you need to play a video game? No. Do you need to watch pornography? No. Can you go to the library? Yes. It's boring at the library, Dr. K. Oh my God, it's so boring. Well, boredom doesn't bother you anymore, so ain't no thing. Your life will be transformed with this one very simple trick. Learn to be bored. Be OK with being bored. You get very good at being bored. And then eventually something cool will happen. As you're bored, your mind will finally come crawling to you and it'll say, please give me something to do. It's like, all right, son, let's learn physics. And your mind is like, OK, fine. And then you will be in control of your mind and it will not be in control of you.
