 So I think when it comes to burnout and depression, one of the most underutilized tools is like cleaning and diet. I know it's kind of weird, but cleaning is almost like a poor person's EMDR, if you all know what that is. So eye movement, desensitization, retraining, or whatever, is a treatment for trauma. And what we essentially do in EMDR, have someone focus their eyes in a particular pattern, so it requires cognitive attention. And we ask them to recall or even we'll read back or have them talk about traumatic experiences. So normally when we discuss or talk about traumatic experiences, it triggers a physiologic response. Our adrenaline shoots the roof, our cortisol goes up, because recalling the trauma creates a flashback. But when we do EMDR and someone is focusing on something else, it blunts the physiologic response. And cleaning is really interesting, because when we clean, I think it does something very similar. Where our mind has 50% autopilot, it's just kind of processing. And then at the same time, we're sort of doing something a little bit physical, so we don't get lost in our thoughts when we clean.
