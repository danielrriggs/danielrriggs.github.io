 I'm also not entirely sure like I think it's healthy to share but I'm not sure that men like need to share right to be blunt So I kind of hear this from my wife where where you know, i'll catch up with a friend of mine You know like that i haven't seen in four or five years and she's like did you talk about their divorce and i'm like no We didn't talk about the divorce She's like but you haven't seen him in so long and like he got divorced like how could you know like no Like we talked about video games because that's what we do That resonates with me. So like we don't we don't need to talk like I know he's divorced He knows he's divorced, you know And then like the way that we connect and heal and the way that we bond is by like going back to a time That's happier and like i'm done and now being a fucking psychiatrist. I can analyze it and say like yeah I'm like showing him that i'm still accept him that nothing has changed I don't think any less of him Yeah I still think he's a good human being that I value him the same that i'm gonna be there for him in the way that I was 15 years ago and this is the way that we do it. Right, right and it makes a lot of sense
