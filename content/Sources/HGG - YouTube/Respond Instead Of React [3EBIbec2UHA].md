 I'm talking about like literally if you just understand the effect of your emotions on your behaviors. This whole thing where it's like there's no like modification internally. The capacity to internally modify. The capacity to respond instead of react. That's what you all should focus on. Let whatever comes in comes in. We can't really control that. I can do some magic in here and then what comes out can be different. And when you start controlling what comes out of you then your life will change because that's all you can control. We waste so much energy trying to control everything else.
