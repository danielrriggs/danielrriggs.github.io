 We always think about change as like a solo practice. We don't really realize that oftentimes it like it takes two to change one. Like you need all the effort that you can put forth and you need someone else's help. Now it doesn't work if they're trying to change you and you don't wanna change yourself or you're trying to change someone and they don't wanna change. Then that's toxic. But to go to your partner and say, hey, this needs to change. I want you to change this and lay out your reasons why. And for them to say like, yes, I'm willing to do this or not willing to do this. I think that's super healthy actually.
