 And so there's an alternative to going down the route of self-love. And if you're someone who gets incredibly frustrated by like, I don't want to love myself. I don't deserve to love myself. I actually want to make something of my life. You don't need to force yourself into doing something that feels unnatural. Instead, what you need to focus on is building grit. And building grit is about not about doing it or accomplishing, because let's remember, if you lack a confidence, you can't accomplish anything. Instead, building grit is just about not giving up. And so if you are able to make this cognitive reframe and instead of focusing on even succeeding, what you really need to focus on is, I'm going to keep trying and I'm not going to give up no matter what. And if you're able to do that, this is going to be the alternate path to transform your life so that if you can shape the circumstances around you by not giving up, then you will deservedly feel love and pride and confidence for what you've accomplished.
