 And this is what happens in emotional relationships or manipulative relationships. When you try to set a boundary with someone, they're going to evoke guilt. And guilt is like the nuclear missile of like emotional manipulation, because it makes it your fault, right? And what does the narcissist want to do? They want to absolve themselves of all guilt and they're going to make it your fault. When you try to set a boundary, if you're doing something wrong and I can convince you that you're guilty, you're going to cave your own boundary and then you're going to come like crawling on your hands and knees to me to make me like happy, right? That's like, just think about the psychological crap that goes on in your head when you try to tell someone that they are doing something hurtful and somehow they do this f**king jiu-jitsu where it's your fault and you feel bad, right? You originally criticized them, but now you're like making it up to them. Like what the hell is going on there? It's because it comes down to guilt. They're going to make you feel guilty.
