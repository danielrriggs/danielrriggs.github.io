 So as a doctor, right, I can go to work and I can do a really good job and I can try my hardest, but I can't necessarily save a life. And that's what's so tricky is that when we work really hard, we think, oh, I deserve to save this life or I did everything that they could. Why isn't this person living? It's just not how it works. So medicine teaches you how to walk that tight rope really well, which is that in this life, all you can do is like control your actions, but you can't control how anyone else responds. And the really beautiful thing about this is as you start to really focus on what you're doing instead of expecting other people to behave in alignment with what you want, it actually frees up a ton of brain space because instead of worrying about how this other person is going to behave and how can I get them to do this and how can I make sure I get promoted instead of worrying about all this, that's the kind of stuff I'm going to focus on my work. I'm going to focus on what makes me happy. I'm going to focus on how I want to live this life. And if these people want to recognize it, the value in that, that's fine. If they don't want to recognize the value in it, why do I want to waste my time being upset that someone doesn't recognize my value? That doesn't help me at all.
