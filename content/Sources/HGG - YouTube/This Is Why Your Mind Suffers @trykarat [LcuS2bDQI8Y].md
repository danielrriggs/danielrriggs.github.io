 And that's what I really loved about sort of like studying to become a monk is it was very like scientific. It wasn't about belief or whatever. Like my teachers were like, okay, like here's what we think the mind is. Here's what we think you are. So go and experiment, right? So try to understand where your desires come from. What is the ego? And they kind of teach it to me, right? They'd say that attributes of the ego are that it's comparative. So anytime you make a comparison to another person, that is actually coming from your ego. And so you go and you test it. You tell us if this is correct or incorrect. And it turned out that they were right like 99% of the time. So it's very grounded in not, hey, it's how you feel and this like vibes. It's very like, no, like this is our understanding of the mind and the world and the changes you need to introduce to yourself to improve. It's less woo woo. And it's more like they're like, well, your mind, like it suffers because it tries to compare to other things. Like, I guess I didn't expect that, honestly.
