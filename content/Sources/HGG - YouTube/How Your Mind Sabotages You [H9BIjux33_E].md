 If you are ashamed of yourself because you're behind, you don't believe in yourself. If you don't believe in yourself, your mind calculates your attempts as failure. So like your mind is thinking, okay, we're pathetic, we're behind. So if we try, we are destined to fail. If we're destined to fail, then that hurts, right? Because we're going to put forth all this effort and we're not going to get anything from it. That sounds like a bad deal. Imagine I came up to you and I said, boy, do I have an opportunity for you. I'm launching my new crypto coin and you can buy it today for 10 grand and you will get one HG Dr. K coin and the HG Dr. K coin will give you nothing in return. Would you ever take that? Of course not. I guess we're going to start our own cryptocurrency now. And this is what your mind is thinking. If you are ashamed of yourself and if you don't believe in yourself, it believes that all efforts will lead to failure. And if all efforts lead to failure, it is going to try to convince you to not buy that cryptocurrency. It is going to do everything within its power to protect you from that failure, which is precisely why it tries to sabotage your attempts to move forward.
