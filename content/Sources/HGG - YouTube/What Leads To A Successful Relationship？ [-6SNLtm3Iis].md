 I know it's kind of weird, but I encourage you to really think about the impact of red flags on your relationship. I want you to think about the impact of green flags on your relationship. Is this the kind of situation where I'm looking for perfect and something always falls apart? And if you really think about it, you're losing out on something that's really important, which is finding a partner who's willing to change, who cares about you enough to change a fundamental aspect of their life. And that's probably the kind of person you want to end up with. I'm not saying that y'all should chase red flags. I'm not saying that red flags are good and the more that you have, the better off your relationship is going to be. What I'm saying is that I'm noticing an increasing trend of people looking for perfect. And the more that they look for perfect, the more that they delay conflict resolution. And if you really look at what leads to prognostically very successful relationships, it's the ability to navigate conflict and compromise. And oftentimes as we discount people with red flags, we don't give people a chance to change and to grow and to whatever. That's actually shooting us in the foot. So it's just something for y'all to think about and hopefully balance a little bit.
