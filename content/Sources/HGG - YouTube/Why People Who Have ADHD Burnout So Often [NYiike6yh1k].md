 Burnout usually comes from trying really hard and not seeing a result, right? So I'm going to kind of focus on this, which is very common for people with ADHD. So what happens when you've got ADHD is you have a world that is designed for brains that are not yours. And so what you have to do is try extra hard or develop adaptations that are more costly, right? So other people can move through life relatively easier, but everything causes a lot of friction for you. It's hard to make friends, even like socializing becomes something that you have to spend a lot of effort in because you know you shouldn't be interrupting people. You should be paying attention. You just introduced yourself and you forgot what this person's name is. And so if you look at sort of the experience of people with ADHD, they're very burnout prone because they expend a lot of effort and it requires twice as much effort to get what a neurotypical person may get.
