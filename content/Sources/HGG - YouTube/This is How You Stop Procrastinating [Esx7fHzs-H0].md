 And what are we actually trying to do? We're trying to stop procrastinating. So what we're trying to do is get started. But when we layer in that second victory condition of this needs to be perfect so that people will love me, like that's really hard because you can't get people to love you. And now it's like, I'm playing an RTS game, or let's say I'm playing an FPS game, and the victory condition is like something that doesn't exist in the game. It's like there's one victory condition which is score like 15 points by hitting 15 bullseyes. And the second victory condition is get elected as president of the United States. Like that's not even in the game. That's what we're doing. Like if you're trying to like study and your mind is adding this thing of, if you don't get an A, your parents won't love you, like how are you even supposed to study? Like there's nothing in the textbook about making your parents love you. That's something you're layering on top. So separate those two things. It's the only shot you've got is to separate those two things.
