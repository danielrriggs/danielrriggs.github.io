 A ton of the people that I've worked with, patients, clients, even friends who are getting married for example, will get married a year from now, but they will commit to having a particular suit size or dress size that is one or two sizes smaller than what they're wearing right now. So they're sort of forcing themselves to have a wedding dress that may not fit them. And the shame of not being able to fit into your wedding dress actually motivates you to get into shape. And this is the key problem is that we've stopped utilizing shame. So what I want you all to do is pick whatever it is that makes you ashamed and then try to pick a target 30 days from now where you are going to do that thing. And then ask yourself, okay, if I'm going to do this or I'm going to do this 30 days from now, what can I do between now and then that would make me feel less ashamed about myself? What can I do between then and now that will help me get good and feel less of that shame and harness that motivation, that fear of shame because it hurts so much to actually make progress towards your goals.
