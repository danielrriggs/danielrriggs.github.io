 So here's the wild thing. When you don't talk enough and you're in a social setting, no one is ever going to get that feedback. The person who talks too much is never going to realize, I need to be quiet. And if they never realize I need to be quiet and they don't give you the space to speak up, you will never speak up. And this is the problem is that we assume people who don't talk a lot, you think it's an individual problem and I need to learn how to talk more. But it's not an individual problem because speaking is relational. Someone else has a certain component to it. It's not just you need to speak up more, other people need to shut up. But there's no place for people to be told that. You can't go into a group of friends and say, hey, I'm having trouble participating because every time someone asks a question, you open your mouth. You're totally happy to talk if someone invites you into the conversation. And in fact, what you're looking for is an invitation to the conversation. So one person wants to talk, one person doesn't want to talk. It's really simple. Get the person who talks too much to bring the other person into the conversation.
