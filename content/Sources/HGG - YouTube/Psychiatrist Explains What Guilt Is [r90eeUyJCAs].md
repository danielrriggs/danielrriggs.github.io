 Let's remember that negative emotions are drivers for positive change. So if I get angry at someone because they steal from me, instead of like processing that anger with a therapist, I can use that anger to set boundaries with them and block them, right? The other thing is if we look at emotions like guilt and shame, like we can go into a therapist's office and we can metabolize them with the therapist, but why do we feel guilt? We feel guilt because sometimes we do the wrong things and guilt is an emotion that helps us do the right thing. That's how we know the difference between right and wrong. If we didn't have guilt, we wouldn't have an internal moral compass.
