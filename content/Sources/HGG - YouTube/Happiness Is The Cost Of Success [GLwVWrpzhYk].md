 The stuff that makes us miserable is the stuff that makes us successful. So if we look at even things like the human brain, the human brain is geared for survival, not contentment or happiness. If we look at what it takes to succeed, that's what it takes to succeed, not what it takes to be happy. Completely independent stuff. And the biggest mistake that we tend to make is that we think that enjoyment is happiness. So we turn to dopaminergic things, eating good food, driving nice cars, having a nice place, playing video games, like whatever. And this is what we've seen with about 400 content creators now. You'll see this pattern where it's like they're so good at ladulating themselves towards success. They will sacrifice everything. And at the top of the list is their mental well-being. That's the first thing to go and it's the thing that they will trade out as much as possible. I'm willing to sacrifice my internal well-being for external accomplishment.
