 And so if AI can ever cross the barrier of substituting for a therapist, what this fundamentally means is we have now trained a computer or an artificial intelligence to replace an actual human being in a relationship context. And if we ever cross that barrier, I think what we should be worried about is way more than making a job obsolete. Because if an AI can actually substitute for a human being, it'll be able to substitute for human beings in other kinds of relationships, like friendships, maybe even parental relationships, maybe even romantic relationships. And the really funny thing is that this is actually already starting to happen. With this concept like waifus, there are some human beings out there who have relationships with imaginary or virtual people. They'll go on dates with their waifu. And so what I'm really concerned about is if AI ever replaces human beings in relationships, I literally don't know what's going to happen to the human race.
