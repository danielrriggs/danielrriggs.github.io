 I'm going to give you all the little hack that I use to pretend to be smart, which is that I write about everything before I open my mouth. So before I did my first stream on Twitch, I was writing a book or I wrote a book about the neuroscience and psychology of technology. It is this 160 page mammoth tome that is absolute garbage. But what that process of writing when I wrote 160 pages and like 88,000 words, it clarified all of my ideas so that when I opened my mouth, it made me sound like I was a smart person. So when it comes to clearly communicating, the most important thing that you can do is write out your thoughts. You don't have to repeat them or memorize them or anything like that. But if you look at the neuroscience of writing and speaking, when we go through the process of verbalization and sort of writing this stuff out, this is when we actually clarify our thinking. And now the cool thing is when you open your dumb mouth, all of the thinking has already been done so that when you start speaking, it comes out super clear.
