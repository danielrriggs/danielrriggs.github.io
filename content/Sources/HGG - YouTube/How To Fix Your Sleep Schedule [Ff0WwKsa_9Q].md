 If you want to go to bed on time, it's not even about bedtime. It's about daytime. You have to understand, okay, what is the part of my brain that allows me to sleep or keeps me from sleeping? Because you want to sleep, but something in your brain is not letting you sleep. There are a couple of important inputs that we need to understand. Number one, any kind of work that we need to do if your brain is not satisfied with what you've done today, it will keep you awake. So this first four hours of the day, you need to be as productive as possible. Next thing, any amount of pent up emotions or stress will activate your mind and has been artificially suppressed. So you want to spend one hour just with unstructured mental activity. Next thing is there are certain dietary things that we can do. Be careful about super high fat diets and have a decent amount of healthy carbohydrate before you go to bed. It's fine. I'm not talking about dessert. I'm talking about dinner. Complex carbohydrates will also leak glucose into your system and glucose will actually suppress orexin and help you fall asleep. So you want to have maybe a really solid meal two hours before bed and then no devices folks hate to say it, but that's how it is. And this is how people who don't have trouble sleeping sleep.
