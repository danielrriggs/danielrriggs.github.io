 Socially anxious people struggle with socially oblivious people. This is what creates your anxiety. Like, a socially anxious person is hyper aware. And the socially oblivious person is hypo aware. And these two things fit really together. Because if someone is socially aware, they're gonna acknowledge, they're gonna recognize that, hey, I should stop talking at some point, so that this other person can jump in. The problem is that socially anxious people think that they're screwing up, but that's because they're a socially oblivious person you're talking to. Who doesn't, like, think about when you should speak? And that a conversation is between two people. So stop beating yourselves up if someone else doesn't know how to talk. And that's something that we don't acknowledge, right? So like right now when we think about social anxiety, we're like, oh my god, it's a problem in me. Fix me, fix me, fix me. But any social interaction involves two people. And oftentimes socially anxious people grew up with oblivious communicators.
