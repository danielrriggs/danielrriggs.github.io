 We've sort of gate-kept the idea of learning behind universities, but most of what we do, most of what we learn is not taught at a university, right? Like that's what's changing. It's becoming a tragedy that like universities are becoming assembly lines. They're not places of education. We do most of the learning on our own. So where is the most appropriate space to give a commencement speech? I think it's on the internet. To random people who are out there learning how to navigate their life and get their shit together. And so bravo to you.
