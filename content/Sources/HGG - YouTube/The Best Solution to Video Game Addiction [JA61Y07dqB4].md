 I think the challenge though is that if we really look at it, the best antidote to video game addiction is actually self understanding. So the challenge right now is that platforms are not regulating themselves, right? Their goal is to try to increase the amount of time that users use the platform. And furthermore, even if we look at policy and things like that, if we look at scientific studies, it takes five years to basically do a scientific study. And so the institutions that we've relied on to protect us are not moving as rapidly as technology is evolving, right? Does that kind of make sense to people? Like technology is just moving so fast. And so our approach at Healthy Gamer is that we can't sort of rely on the government to fix the problem. We can't really rely on video game developers to fix the problem. So what we really have to do is teach people themselves about their own attention. How do you control your attention? How do you understand what your desires are? How do you accomplish what you want? And so our focus is on the individual because we sort of can't rely on anyone else to fix the problem for us, so we've got to fix it ourselves.
