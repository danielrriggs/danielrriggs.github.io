 And I know it sounds weird, but when people are going through a war, this is where everyone who has it worse than you needs you to be the best that you can so that you can help them. Right. If someone is like drowning, if you can stand on firm footing and hold them, that's way easier. That's a way better chance to help another human being than if you're treading water. Right. When my feet are firmly planted on the ground, I can hold someone up. But when I'm treading water, it's so much harder to help another human being. And so this is where I'd say, like, you should prioritize your struggles. I'm not saying that you should do it to the exclusion of helping other people. But this is where I want you to understand that you have a responsibility to the rest of humanity to get your in order, because, like, we need you. The human race needs you. So get your in order as quickly as you can. You don't need to be ashamed about it. You shouldn't invalidate it. And at the same time, like you need to get it taken care of.
