 Anytime your mind tells you it won't be good enough, what is your mind actually trying to do? It's trying to protect you from pain. Oh, I shouldn't study for this test. Why? Because it won't be enough. You won't get an A. Then you may ask yourself, but wait, what is it trying to protect me from? It's trying to protect me from a B because I want an A. But if I get a B or if I get a C or if I get an F and I tried, I'm going to be so devastated. So your mind tells you it won't be enough. It won't be enough is a trick that the mind plays to reduce your desire to act. So if you really want to fix your life, the most important thing to do is to do things that are not enough. Every single one that I have taught to do things that are not enough has substantially improved their life. If you can start doing the insufficient, your life will change. Oh my God, exercising for 20 minutes is not going to be enough, so I might as well not do it. You're right. If you want to get whatever the f**k your goal is, you need to exercise for 90 minutes, but do the thing that is not enough. See, that's the problem is we all look for the thing that'll work. We need to start doing the things that won't be enough because the real success comes not from the thing that working or not working, the real success comes from the doing.
