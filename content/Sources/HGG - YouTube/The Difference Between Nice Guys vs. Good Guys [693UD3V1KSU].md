 There's a big difference between being selfless and being a nice guy. So a nice guy is someone who acts selflessly in order to get something in return. Oh, your boyfriend just dumped you? Let me take you out to dinner for Valentine's Day just so you don't feel alone. I'm going to do it out of like the kindness of my heart. And then after a few months of doing this, surely you'll fall in love with me because I have all the qualities. I'm not going to abandon you like your boyfriend did. I'm going to be such a sacrificial nice person. But at the end of it, nice guys want something. Nice guys aren't good guys. They're nice. Nice guys expect something in return. Good guys expect nothing in return. They're good because they want to be good, not because they're trying to use it as manipulation of you. When you say, I feel like I struggle to convey authenticity, why the f**k do you even care about conveying authenticity? See, if your goal is to convey authenticity, then you want something in return. Stop trying to convey authenticity. Be authentic. If other people see it, they see it. If they don't see it, they don't see it.
