 There's one key to understand whether your mind is functioning properly or improperly, and that is whether there is the presence of emotion or ego. If you have emotions that are active, then your logic will be flawed. And this is where people will say, no, but I am perfectly logical. If you cannot feel emotions, that means that they are active. That means that they are active and suppressed. Tons of fMRI studies that show that our emotional circuits of the brain are active all day and all night. You always have emotion. So if you can't feel the emotion, that just means it's active and you're unaware of it. Blindness and inactivity are two different things. So if you are aware of your emotions and they don't control you, then your thoughts will be good. The second sign that mind is that your logic is flawed is the presence of ego. And what is ego? I statements or comparisons. Anytime your mind says, I am dot, dot, dot, therefore I can or cannot do this. That is flawed. Anytime your mind says this person can do this, but I can't do it because I'm this. That is ego. Your logic will be flawed.
