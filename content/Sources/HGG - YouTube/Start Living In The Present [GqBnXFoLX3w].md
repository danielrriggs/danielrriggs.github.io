 So let us understand why do we do not write into the air. This is a deep spiritual concept. When we write on the paper, what happens to the writing? It becomes something to hold on to. So all human beings want to hold on to things. This is the problem. So why do we take a photo instead of enjoying vacation? I was on vacation at a beach and what I saw is no one is enjoying the beach. And what do they do? They take picture. And then I asked them, why you, all you are doing, a thousand people are taking pictures all the time. I asked, why are you taking picture? So I can remember. If you sit and actually enjoy, then you will create memory. What is your memory of vacation? Is taking pictures instead of actually living. We take a picture of a beautiful flower because we want to hold onto that flower forever. We will frame it and put it up, but instead you are right. We should write only in the air, live in the present. If you go to concert, no need to record on your phone. Listen to the music, enjoy the life, write in the air. Let go of paper.
