 If you are vulnerable to manipulation, what that literally means is that your emotions will induce your actions. So some human beings go through life thinking that the way to solve emotional problems is through action. If my significant other is mad at me, I need to buy them a gift. The way to resolve that emotion is by paying some price or inducing a behavior. And if I get them the gift, then the emotion goes away. I feel better about myself because, whoo, thank God they're not mad at me anymore. But think about that, right? What's happening? Now what you've done is you've reinforced this idea that the way that I'm going to fix my emotions is by engaging in some kind of behavior. And so I want you all to really realize that your ability to be manipulated is tied entirely to emotions and actions being tied in your mind.
