 So when a relationship is the most important thing to you, oh my God, relationships are the most important thing to me. Oh my God, I like, I need it. This is what they mean to me. They mean that there's love and there's commitment and there's like someone on your team all the time, someone there for you whenever you need it. And then you have this idea of, oh my God, like this relationship with this beautiful, what a beautiful relationship. And then some unlucky human being has to pick up that mantle. Some unlucky human being with flaws is now trying to interact with you. But you're not interacting with them because you have a preconceived idea of what the relationship should be. This is what I want. I need all of these things from, and then some human, just a human, just a person, is like, I don't know how to handle this. Like, I can't make this person happy. So they feel all of that pressure and it pushes them away. So paradoxically, the first thing that you need to do if relationships are the most important thing in the world to you is make them less important.
