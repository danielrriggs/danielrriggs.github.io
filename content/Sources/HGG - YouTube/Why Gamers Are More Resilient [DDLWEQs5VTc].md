 And then the other really interesting aspect of video games is that while they sort of discourage some levels of social activity, studies show that gamers were actually more resilient to depression during the pandemic than the rest of the population.

On the one hand, it makes us hard to sort of form new friendships in real life, and at the same time, we can develop a robust support system through the internet that we can take with us wherever we go.
