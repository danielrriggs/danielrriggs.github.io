 So if we look at opening up to other humans, it's kind of weird, but we think about it as an internal thing. How do I have the courage to open up? How do I overcome this weakness? I don't want to burden other people. So here's the key thing to understand when it comes to opening up to other people. It's no longer a solo game. Suddenly there's a relational component. So when you say, I don't want to burden other people, that's where the way that you resolve that is not through courage. You don't overcome your fears of burdening other people. There's a relational component. So what you do is talk to them. Ask for permission. Ask for feedback. Hey, is it okay if I talk to you about something that's like I'm struggling with right now? So the whole point of opening up to another human being is there's a relational component to it. It now involves more than one person. And what we try to do is solve all the anxieties in our head without ever interacting with the other person. And so the cool thing is that you don't actually have to have the courage to overcome all that stuff. Since this is relational, you can just ask the other person.
