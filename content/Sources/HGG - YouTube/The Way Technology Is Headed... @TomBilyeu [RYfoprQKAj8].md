 As a human race, like nuclear war is not gonna f*** us. It's gonna be stuff like haptic feedback and virtual girlfriends and things like that. This is what happened with video games. Someone is gonna figure out that with an AI girlfriend, the way to really get someone addicted is we have to approximate the real experience as much as possible. Which means once in a while, your AI girlfriend is gonna pick a fight with you. And she's actually gonna hang up on you when you call her. I don't know if this is true or not, but I would bet money that over time, this is exactly what we're gonna see. And as we do that, we're activating other parts of the brain and we're making this virtual experience approximate the real thing. Because I'm sure you're familiar with random reinforcement schedules, right? So right now, the problem with porn is that anytime I watch it, it's always available. The moment that someone figures out that denying someone their pornography, 20% of the time means that they're gonna come to your website more. That's so crazy.
