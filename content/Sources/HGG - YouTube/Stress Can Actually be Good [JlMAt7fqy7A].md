 There have been some really interesting studies on this concept of what we call eustress. So we're all familiar with this term distress, which is that when the stress level that we're in gets so high that it actually causes a negative impact in our performance. But there's also the science of something called eustress, which is the optimal level of stress for performance. Let's say I'm playing kickball with a bunch of two-year-olds. I'm not going to play the best kickball of my life because I'm playing against two-year-olds and it's just kind of boring and it's kind of completely lopsided and unfair and things like that. So when our stress level is too low, we actually enter into the boredom state. And as we enter into the boredom state, we're not going to be as productive. As the stress level increases, as we get more engaged, we actually enter this period of eustress, which is this middle zone where a certain level of stress is out that we're actually mentally very activated and focused on the task.
