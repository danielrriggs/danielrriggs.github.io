 We're going to teach y'all how to make friends using two rules in under two minutes. So friendship requires two basic things. First thing it requires is common cause. So people have to be there for a shared purpose. This is the first way that human beings bind together. The second thing that they need is regular unplanned interactions. So you need to see this person more than once without the two of y'all making a plan to see each other. This is why we make friends in places like classes, because we show up, we've got to study for the same test, and we get to see each other day after day after day after day without either of us forcing it. The problem that we run into nowadays is that we try to force interactions with people, so it feels like way too artificial and pressured. And the second thing is that you can't like randomly meet people and make friends with them because you have no common cause. So if you want to make friends, what you need to do is check these two boxes.
