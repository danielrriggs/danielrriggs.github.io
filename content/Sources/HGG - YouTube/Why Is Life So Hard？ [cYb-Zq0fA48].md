 So I'm spending 108 hours for one semester of calculus, and over the course of the year, I spend 216 hours of dedicated study to learn calculus. Now when it comes to living your life, how many hours of dedicated study do you have? Do you go to class where you learn certain concepts about how to live your life, and then spend two hours applying those concepts for every hour that you learn? Do you spend nine hours a week practicing how to live life with intention, where someone is teaching you what the principles are, and then you practice? Absolutely not. The reason that life is hard is because we don't spend time learning how to live life, right? You just kinda get bodied by life. You're sort of struggling over here, and then this thing happens, and you try to manage. You're managing, managing, managing, coping, coping, instead of ever intentionally learning. And as long as you are not doing that, if you don't know how to live life, of course life is gonna be hard.
