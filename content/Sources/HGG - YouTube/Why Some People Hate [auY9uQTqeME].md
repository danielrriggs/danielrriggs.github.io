 Let's say that I'm taught that homosexuality is bad, evil. And I grew up in a situation where homosexuality is viewed as bad. So as I start to have homosexual feelings, I feel homosexual and homosexuality is bad, therefore I am bad. And then it's very hard to go through life hating a part of yourself. What's way easier is for us to take that hate towards ourself and project it towards somebody else. And you'll notice this is true for many people, everyone basically. The things that you hate the most in other people are the things that you hate about yourself. I f***ing hate that I'm always late. And do you have compassion for other people when they're late? No, screw these people! I hate that these people are late. And so we have this very simple trick that we do that when I hate myself, because I can't fix it, right? It's who I am. So instead what I'm going to do is I'm going to prove to myself that I'm like, this thing is bad and I can punish other gay people. And the more that I punish other gay people, the more it aligns with my conditioning and I just sort of don't have to worry about the fact that I'm gay.
