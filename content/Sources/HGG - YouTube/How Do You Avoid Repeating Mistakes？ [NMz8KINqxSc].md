 What is the one evolutionary signal that our brain needs to signal to us that hey, this strategy is not working? How does the brain know that hey, we need to rethink how we approach this and we need to learn a new way of handling this? It turns out that the most powerful signal to rewire your brain is starvation. Because a million years ago when our brains evolved, here's the sort of idea, right? So like if I'm living my life and everything is going really well, then we're fine. We don't need to change anything. Because if it ain't broke, don't fix it. How does our brain know that we're starting to screw up when we can't find food anymore? Because our brains have evolved for survival, right? Not to live in this digital age where we're bombarded with all this stimuli. And so what's going on in today's society? We're actually inhibiting the starvation and fasting signals that induce neurogenesis.
