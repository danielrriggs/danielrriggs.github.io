 How do I develop healthy technology habits? I'll get this question from parents as well, like how much screen time is too much screen time and like all this kind of stuff. And then I thought to myself, well, what if we just took all the principles of intermittent fasting and applied them to tech? What if we restricted our technology use to eight hours a day? Because I think that solves automatically a lot of problems. So I decided to actually try it. So for about a two, now it's been almost three week period, I implemented intermittent fasting for technology. And what does that mean? That means that I restrict all of my technologies to eight hours a day. And you may say to yourself, but hold on a second, like how is that possible? Like how are you going to have fun? Right. Because like if I say something like that, what's your initial reaction? I can't restrict technology usage to eight hours a day. So you really can't do that, right? Because I have to work for eight hours and work requires technology. Right. So it sounds impossible, but this is where actually it's like really, really fantastic. And it is way more manageable than you could possibly imagine.
