 When we sleep, our brain does two major things. The first thing that it does is something called memory consolidation. So as we start learning stuff throughout the day, it actually fills up something called our short-term memory. And stuff in our short-term memory gets consolidated into our long-term memory through this part of our brain called the hippocampus while we sleep. So this function of memory consolidation happens while we sleep. And you can sort of think about this as like, let's say I'm working on like a paper or something. Let's say I'm writing a paper, I'm drawing something on the computer. So right now this information is stored in my computer's RAM, but in order to store it to the hard drive, I have to like save it, right? And once it's stored to the hard drive, I can close it and I can recall it. But if it gets wiped from my RAM before I ever save it, then I'll sort of lose the information. And if we kind of think about what happens in our brain when we sleep, when it comes to memory, that's the time in which our brain learns.
