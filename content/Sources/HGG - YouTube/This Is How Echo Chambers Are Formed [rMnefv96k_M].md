 If you think a piece of information is wrong and you're listening to someone else and your mind is Reflexively challenging it if you really want to learn and change what you should do is try to Understand how that information could be right so try to take the other person's point of view and question your own beliefs, right? So this is something that the internet doesn't do the internet is like hey, I think this is wrong therefore Screw them down vote cancel them We never question our own beliefs and this is how we create echo chambers and this is how we stay stuck So if you are someone who consumes some kind of content, this is really common by the way, right? So we see this a lot with like people who are consuming content that they disagree with this can be political where I'm gonna watch Videos of people who I politically disagree with and I'm gonna just poop on them in my head and I'm gonna feel better about myself So this is what our mind reflexively does So if you want to really learn something, I know it sounds insane, but try to understand the other person's perspective
