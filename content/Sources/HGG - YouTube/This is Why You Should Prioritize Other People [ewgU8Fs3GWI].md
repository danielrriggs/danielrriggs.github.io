 Last thing that we're gonna talk a little bit about is also something that I hear a lot from hustle culture, which is putting yourself first. So a lot of people out there will sort of say that, this is a dog eat dog world, and that if you wanna get ahead in life, you've gotta prioritize yourself. No one's gonna look out for you, so you gotta look out for yourself. In my experience, that's actually not the case, where what I've really found is that prioritizing other people in a lot of situations is actually the best thing in terms of your productivity and success. If you're always looking out for yourself and you're kind of number one in every situation, then other people are gonna start stop looking out for you. And if other people stop looking out for you, that's gonna create all kinds of problems in terms of lack of professional opportunities, in terms of people not asking you for help, in terms of all kinds of things.
