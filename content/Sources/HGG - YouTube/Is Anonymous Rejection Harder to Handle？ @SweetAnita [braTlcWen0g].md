 I like this girl. I see her at the grocery store all the time, but I'm scared to talk to her in case she rejects me. And they know nothing about her. How could she reject anything about you? She doesn't know you. If you're going to have one conversation with her and be scared to get rejected, like the most rejection you can get is that she doesn't want to hang out with you or isn't interested in the conversation. Yeah, this this makes a lot of sense. I would bet money that 90 percent of the men who are listening to this conversation do not believe that you need to be known to be rejected. Like, I think you have to know someone to actually reject them. Yeah. Like, I don't feel rejected if someone tries to speak to me and they're like, they don't. Something about the statement that you just made that you can't get rejected if someone doesn't know you, that runs contrary to so much of my experience. You can get rejected so easily. And in fact, I would imagine that a lot of men that I know would agree that it's easier to get rejected without people knowing you.
