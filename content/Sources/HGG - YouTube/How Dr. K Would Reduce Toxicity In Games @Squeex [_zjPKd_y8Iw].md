 A couple of really simple things I would do to reduce toxicity. There needs to be a much shorter time span between bad behavior and consequence. So right now the way that the gaming industry works is like, I get reported in the game of Dota 2. What happens? Nothing happens. Nothing forever. A couple weeks go by, it gets served up to some community person who now they have a community driven like judging system, right? And then like three weeks later, someone passes judgment and bans me. And so I did something bad and then last week I didn't do anything bad at all. And I log in and I'm banned for 30 days. So that doesn't, I don't correct behavior. I just get pissed. Yeah. And you're not even sometimes not sure why you even got banned in the first place. Sometimes not sure. The majority of people are not given a reason for why they were banned.
