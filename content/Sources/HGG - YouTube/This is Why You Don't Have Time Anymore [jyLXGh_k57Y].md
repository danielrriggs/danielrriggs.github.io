 This is what's really wild is like, I don't know if you all realize this, you know how long it takes to read a book. The average book is 80,000 words. The average human reads at the pace of 300 words a minute, which means that the average person can finish the average book in six hours. And we have 40 hours a week of free time. And we've already accounted for cooking, cleaning, exercise, errands and crap like that. So I read four books in two weeks because I don't have anything else to do. And it was actually really great. I just started doing all the stuff that is on your to do list that you don't have time to do. And why don't you have time to do it? It's because you spend four hours a day on your cell phone and seven hours a day on a screen. And only some of it is work. But the thing is, work doesn't have to fill out eight hours. This is the other wild thing. The average person spends eight hours at work, but they really only do between three and six hours of productive work a day. And you know this, right? Most of what you do at work is getting distracted and then eventually you'll do some work. So what would happen if we started making everything efficient? This is what intermittent fasting for technology has helped me do.
