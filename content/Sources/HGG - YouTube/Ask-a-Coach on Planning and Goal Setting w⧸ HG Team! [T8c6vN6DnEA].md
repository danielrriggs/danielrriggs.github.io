 happy day Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh All right, hello everybody welcome Welcome in no, this is not a doctor case stream Gigi's debated No, not really Cool hey everyone welcome to another stream welcome to ask a coach This is something we do often on the discord. Hope y'all are doing well Cool so how's everyone doing in chat today? Is The audio okay Alan can you say something just count to five for me for please for me, please one two three four five Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much All right. Awesome Cool. So excited to do this We do this on the discord every now and then I think we've done one ask a coach with about four or five coaches A few months ago and y'all like that. So we're doing this again Today we're talking about planning and goal setting and we're going to talk about that in the context of coaching and what we do at hg Just as an introduction I'm tech teller. I'm the community manager at hg. I often host these events Um, and we usually sort of take the time to talk about a particular topic that our community resonates with that y'all resonate with and we take that and we Put that in the context of coaching we talk with a coach in this case. I have here with me Alan Who's an awesome healthy gamer coach? And he's going to talk about the topic for a bit and then we have some questions that we've taken from the discord And we'll take some questions from the chat and we'll sort of play by ear and go from there But alan if you want to introduce yourself let's let's do that Awesome so as kabir said, my name is alan also known to many my client says Zzz 143 And I wanted to kind of frame today's talk in sort of a particular way Where a lot of clients come in and they're really kind of gung-ho Oh, I guess there's a motorcycle outside. They're really kind of gung-ho about planning and goal setting They like really want to take action And so I want to try to talk about like the number one confusion that I see with these kind of gung-ho clients And part of this confusion I think comes from a little bit of from like what we do so like I'm a mental health coach And one of the problems with that is that it's a little bit of wild west out there when it comes to coaching So anybody can kind of slap, you know I am a coach on their door and then use buzzwords like we're very evidence-based We're very data driven and then in our case, we're like actually trying to do that So we've got a lot of people like a scientific advisory board and a research manager and a director of coaching and a coaching operations manager We like try to make sure That we're measuring our outcomes in sophisticated ways and getting IRB proof studies and all that stuff So then we kind of like throw a lot of stats out here and that brings a lot of these kind of like gung-ho clients to us And then when they show up in a coaching session, they're like really confused As we just start asking them a lot of questions and they're like, I don't understand like you say you're data driven You say you're evidence-based once you tell me like how to actually make things happen and so there's a reason why we do this do it this way and there's kind of a Little detoured nuance here and then we can kind of get into some of the main models So when you have a question like why don't I have gills? There's like a scientific theory that can address that question So in this case, it's the theory of evolution where you've got like a ton of facts That have an interpretive framework. That's very unlikely to change over time Now once you start asking questions that are a little bit more complicated than why don't I have gills? Like why do people vote the way that they do? Then there's still a scientific approach but it's just different So if you ask why people vote they're like political scientists will put The models like okay, so some people vote because Of retrospective performance on the incumbent with regard to the economy Some people vote because of their partisanship some people vote because of their ideology Some people vote because they think that there's a candidate who's less corrupt Now are any of these models? accurate Well, no, of course not voting's way more complicated than that. They're they're evidence-based. They're good starting points But if you really want to understand voting You've got to take these models understand them to a certain extent and then kind of weigh them against your own experience and other people's experiences And then build an eclectic model to try to like get as close to understanding as you can because we don't have a scientific Theory of voting that doesn't exist. We just have models And there's a saying in social science that all models are wrong And just some models are usefully wrong So this is what we try to do with the reason we ask questions at the beginning instead of teaching I mean, there's some instances where we teach but for the most part we don't teach because that's the way that models are supposed to work So even then when I tell gung-ho clients this they're like, okay great like so so we're using models. We're not getting assigned to theory of You know how human beings change because we don't have a scientific theory of how human beings change We just have models that we expect to be wrong So if you have an inkling or a an instinct or an intuition like we actually want to know about that because like maybe you're on to something So once we Take some of these models the gung-ho clients will say say things like well, okay Some models are probably better than others And so I want to start in a kind of like rigorous way not all clients do this Some clients are really into kind of like speculative stuff or like going with their intuition right away But for the clients who want to say like hey, what's your best model? Give me your best model Like this is kind of what we start with So there's a particular phenomenon. So i'm gonna i'm gonna go over like the the most Not necessarily strongest model that we have because we've developed some models internally at hg So we've developed some models internally at hg that might turn out to be like really solid over time In terms of the most established model that we have There it's there to explain a particular phenomenon and this phenomenon is so common that like professors will joke about So perfectly intelligent people are people whose society is deemed to be perfectly intelligent or given an essay It's like you've got to write a 10 page essay. You've got two months to do it Okay, like we've all kind of been there or a lot of us have been there And then what happens you can sit down these these intelligent people can sit down they can write out a plan And they can say here is how i'm going to take action here are the goals and it's almost like the book of genesis It's like, you know on the first day I will create this draft and on the second day I will create this draft and on the third day I will create this draft and it kind of goes on and on and this day I will rest and then eventually I'll like turn in this pristine paper and like it'll be really solid And then what ends up happening is that You know for most people they end up kind of like delaying a lot or they end up kind of pulling an all nighter or two And then like turning in some word vomit and then like hoping that they can get some mercy from the professor And so You know, and then when we ask people about this they'll say things like like oh I need to plan better next time or I didn't plan very good or maybe I planned okay, but I just need to be disciplined or I was too lazy or My my conscientiousness stat is low and there's nothing I can do about it So the most established model that we use says that all that kind of talk is wrong Because for most people planning and taking action is a mistake And the reason for that is because when you sit down to write that essay no matter how good your plan is If you sit down and part of you wants to write that essay and part of you doesn't want to write that essay A house divided against itself cannot stand Or you can be in a slightly separate category where you sit down to write the essay and none of you wants to write the essay And what this model says this is called the stages of change model Is that when you sit down to try to plan that's actually stage three and taking action is stage four If you're in stage one or two house divided against itself, you've got to really think about that And try to get yourself on the same page now to be accurate it's not exactly thinking about it that makes the difference You'll probably know that intellectual analysis doesn't get you very far when it comes to how human beings change But you can like reflect and there's a big difference between reflection on a lot of this stuff Or contemplation and that's what these stages are called the pre-contemplative stage and the contemplative stage There's a big difference between contemplation and reflection and like intellectual analysis So there's like whole books and like dense texts that have been written on the difference between these things Of thinking and reflection, but I can give you all a sense of what that looks like in coaching So what it first looks like is like actually reflecting like we'll hear what the other person says like what our client says And then we'll reflect back what we heard not necessarily word for word, but kind of in your own words like a mirror And people start elaborating So this is a kind of core skill of coaching So there's some nuances in between How this kind of skill plays out in personal coaching where it's just kind of like a one-way relationship or like one-on-one coaching And group coaching because sometimes it's just me and one other client or two other clients when it comes to family coaching and sometimes it is a What's the motorcycle? And so sometimes it's a What was that my notes? Where's that my notes there? Oh, yeah so so sometimes it's it's Me and two other people in the case of family coaching and sometimes it's me and seven other people or maybe like a little bit Less than that in group coaching and in group we want to give you all core skills in terms of Basically skills that allow you to reflect and then have you practice them on other people So we've got reflective listening, which is kind of like saying what you heard in your own words And then you've got kind of digging under ambiguity ideally with open-ended Questions not kind of multiple choice or yes or no and we have something called rolling with resistance Whereas if someone says something that you disagree with and the other person it seems to be kind of attached to these things Like, you know, say someone says two plus two equals five and they're like really attached to that You actually try to express confusion and and curiosity Rather than disagreement or trying to debate the other person so there's kind of a wider bouquet of skills that we Try to teach people in group coaching But those three are what I think of as the primary skills if you kind of take care of those three A lot of the other skills almost take care of themselves And there can be an obstacle with this when it comes to polite So it can be kind of weird as a group when we think about politeness There's a version of politeness in the real world where you know, it can be kind of a good thing But at least in the context of group we think about politeness is a bad thing So the way i'll define it is that politeness is niceness That comes at the expense of kindness that niceness and kindness are two very different things And what we mean by kindness is trying to respond to shared values in the other person And there's three values that we ask y'all to strive toward in group and that's compassion authenticity and presence Now if that seems simple what i've said so far that's because it kind of is and if that seems easy it's not it's really hard So it's normal for group members to struggle a lot With their politeness what's really kind of not okay in group or what we try to make it clear that it's not okay in group is You know struggling with politeness and not like saying it out loud like if you're zoning out when somebody else is talking in session or You know if you really aren't connected to the other person because you think that they have no idea what they're talking about You can struggle with the core skills. You can struggle with the values But it can be Let's see what we're saying so it can just take time and the short answer as to why this process can take time when it comes to getting it from the emotional phase into the action phase is because Basically actions take consequences or actions have consequences. So let's say that you have You know someone who hasn't exercised in like 10 years and they try to run a mile It's not going to go very well for them so I know that kind of dealing with some of these emotions and moving through your emotional phase can seem daunting and there's a couple of other kind of like tidbits or patterns that i've noticed once people get into the action phase when they're actually ready to be in stage three or four of making change in other models but At any rate, uh, that's about all I have in terms of the overall topic. We can get into more specifics So thanks for coming everybody and uh, let's get into some questions Awesome, thank you for starting us off alan with some awesome insights. I'm already seeing really good questions in chat Um, but but just to kind of give people context Can you talk a bit about what is group coaching and like what what happens in group coaching? Why why do people do it? Sure, so a lot of people come to group In order not just to kind of get support for themselves but to understand like how groups in general work How can they kind of understand other people's perspectives with particular skills? and um What ideally what happens is you have? Uh seven members who show up for once a week for 90 minutes There's a facilitator who will kind of guide you through a tutorial phase Where you'll learn particular skills and then once you learn those skills You could like, you know reflective listening asking open-ended questions rolling with the resistance You can turn those skills toward particular goals and more of an action phase and uh, so Uh, let's see. Do you want me to get in more detail about that or is that kind of cover it so far? I think that's good for now. A lot of people are kind of asking Um, so people have trouble getting started and how does a group help with that? So I think group helps in a few ways so One way of getting started is getting people touched with emotions. So it's not always the case that Emotions are the key blocker for motivation, but it's the most common blocker for motivation and um I think uh Let's see So I think in addition to getting in touch with emotions I think group provides a place for accountability and accountability isn't so much about like It's not so much about punishing people or shaming them in a kind of toxic way as opposed to saying Hey, you said that you wanted to do this or you said that you wanted to meditate every week And then you didn't meditate each week. You know, what made that difficult? And then I guess the third branch that my mind's going toward is that when people have trouble getting started There can be a lot of different reasons for that So when you have a bunch of people trying to ask open-ended questions When you have a bunch of people trying to ask open-ended questions and like understanding Hey, like what is what what made you have trouble getting started with this thing? That can vary from task to task Cool, so hopefully that that helps clear things up a bit Um, so someone in chat is asking I have an intention to do something But when it comes to the action, there is something like an invisible wall. Can coaching help me cross this barrier? so yes, it can and there's also a Attention the way that we're talking about it because It is true that there's certain interventions that you can use with regard to intentions to help you move forward So the first thing is to try to clarify like what is an intention? So the short version and if you're interested in more detail, you can check out a workshop. Um, that's on youtube for basically a coaching Webinar I think is what it's called just called motivation and goal setting but there's four different types of intention So if you want to do something just because you want to um, then like let's say you walk past a Hot dog stand and you smell a hot dog your sense organs are affected and then you want that hot dog That's one reason to do something another reason Is because you should do something So if you just should do something because somebody else kind of from the outside came in and imposes it on you Like you should do this or else like almost like an external judgment Then that's another way of motivating yourself Now these two are in the category of external reward which tends to lead to less stable motivation So you can kind of use these to force yourself to do something like go to the gym But I don't know that it's gonna it's usually doesn't work for more than Two or three weeks on the other hand We've got things like um our values kind of like what we really care about on the inside and you can kind of get in Touch with that through silence and a few other means and duties. So what's kind of internally rewarding to you? Um that is has to do with more like sacrifice Those tend to lead to more stable motivation, but I can say that you can hear me say that you can watch Dr. K talk about it. You can watch it in the guide and that stuff is a lot less likely to work well Before people have moved through the emotion phase So, but in terms of you know, the overall trajectory that's where I would start it's like motion phase and then the action phase We would just start clarifying the intentions Awesome, I think kind of a follow-up question or this segues really well into the next one So this person is asking when I set a goal I get discouraged by it in a sense I seem to achieve my wants and desires better when I don't set a certain metric to my goals So my question I think also to expand this a bit is when someone comes into coaching Especially group and everybody has like certain goals. How does the group deal with getting discouraged and sort of falling short? So I think a lot of it depends on Why they're falling short the I can give you the most common example So a lot of the times when people get discouraged It's because the standards that they're using to judge success Kind of it's not exactly clear where they're coming from, but they're coming from like outside sources So if someone wants to run a mile once they come into coaching That's not exactly a doable goal If you're out of shape or even if it's something that you can do Let's say it's something that you you can like read a 500 page book in a week like it's physically possible But when you think you're not going to be able to do it You're not going to be able to do it In a week like it's physically possible But when you think to yourself, oh, I need to read like a 500 page book That's your your mind might try to do it and then just kind of like give up. So that's like, you know operational procrastination So I guess that's the the short answer to your question would just be understanding. So is it a type of procrastination you're dealing with? Is it? Some kind of emotion that's blocking you Is it some kind of you know counterintuitive trick that you might not know about in terms of organizing your mind It's like there's different Tips and tricks we can give and i'm sort of tempted to go down that route But I think even if that stuff helps a little bit the main Essential in what we're doing is just understanding and and what people tend to realize as they operate in coaching is that It's easy to get discouraged when you're kind of given a video game controller And you have no idea what the buttons do And like that's the position that most of y'all are in and what we find is that clients generally speaking aren't Incompetent. It's just that a lot of things like whether it's something as You know supposedly simple as doing the laundry or you know working out. It's not that that is uh, It's not that they're incompetent just that that's harder than it looks and that's another I think trap that we can fall into is that we think that the simple things are Um really easy when actually the simple things are usually really hard So kind of following up if a group members joins a group and They feel discouraged or they share that and they've felt short of their goal for the week How would the group sort of support them and how does that tend to work out? So how it tends to work out that the group will Um try to Support them through these kind of core skills and really kind of give them empathy It doesn't necessarily mean that the group has to agree with What the group member might think because they the group member might have an analysis of the situation that's wrong And in that case we want to just kind of like roll with resistance and really kind of meet them where they're at And then awareness just being aware of what's going on in the emotions can get them a lot of the way there And then from there we can draw on other resources like so for example if a group member is You know more into the action phase we might draw on something from The guide to adhd and doing stuff where you know There's like a counterintuitive thing that um, I think developed from our parent coaching program where you can like if you have a particular Goal, you can kind of go with what intuitively you think the goal is cut it in half and then cut it in half again So there's a place for you know, kind of advice or problem solving but It tends to happen post empathy Gotcha, so it sounds like um, there'll be some amount of challenge there will definitely be a big amount of empathy support And that will be followed up eventually, uh by the group by the person's own research via the coach through some actionable Um So I love this question because this just shows how Epic our community is becoming and how much they're learning. How do you switch from goal oriented to process oriented? Yeah, I love that question. So um I think when you have a particular goal in mind what you want to be focusing on are the next concrete actions that you can take Um, and there's actually I might have a sort of counterintuitive answer to this so I think Part of what you want to do when you're really focused on outcomes and goals is to try to take better control of your mind and Because your mind is going to like switch back. It's going to try to like Make you take actions that are a little bit more goal oriented than process oriented And once people are through the emotional phase There's one particular exercise that seems to kind of rise above the others when it comes to helping people take more control over their mind And then get them more Process-focused than goal-focused So that's the boredom exercise So if you want a kind of detailed explanation of it, you can see dr k talk about it and dr k. How do I focus? but um The the basic Takeaway is that if you have a task that you really want to do or something that you've been striving toward for a long time You can set aside a block of time And then either do the task uh Sleep, although you've got to be a little bit careful about your circadian rhythm and like disrupting your sleep schedule with sleeping or napping put you um, or Doing nothing like actually just doing nothing and people and your mind will come up with a million reasons not to do it It'll be like oh like isn't this a waste of time? It's like yes, actually if you do if you're willing to waste time if you like play chicken with your mind in that way That's the way you kind of take or that's uh, one of the best ways i've seen where people take control of their mind um, and uh, so Yeah, I think that I mean there's more answers I could give but I think that's the main one I would give for now Awesome Cool, um Yeah, by the way chat, how are you all finding this just want to check in real quick And if you have questions keep throwing them at us Because we're here to answer your question. Otherwise, I will make some up Oh in the meantime inside for Oh Okay, awesome, I see great questions, um, so just to keep going Somebody was asking So, can you tell me how to stop procrastinating? I've watched a lot of videos on it, but I I haven't got a clear answer How do I start? Um, I tend to start with the smallest thing but that doesn't work for me So it sounds like this person basically has gotten a lot of advice and it's not working uh, yeah, so The first thing that I would mention is that Procrastination isn't really a great term because it covers a lot of very different phenomenon um, so i'll give some of like, um, This sort of standard answer that we give and then get into some of the nuances so Um, there's a bunch of different types of procrastination Three types of procrastination that are most common so sometimes people procrastinate because They have kind of an idealistic or perfectionistic vision of the tasks that they're going to do and the Sort of um first past answer that we'll give is try to go out of your way To look for feelings of sadness and really mourn the kind of imperfection of whatever tasks that you're doing So it's it's almost like what I think about is the cognitive form of procrastination that you're using your mind to craft this elaborate image and then You you need to kind of go out of your way like cognitively to be like Oh, let me try to notice some feelings or try to find some grief oriented feelings And if you don't go out of your way to look for it if you're just kind of aware of your feelings in general It doesn't work as well Then there's kind of like the classic like avoidance behavior or kind of avoidance or emotional procrastination so when you have An emotion that feels bad about whatever tasks that you're doing Uh, then our mind's going to try to figure out ways to avoid doing it whether it's doing something productive like watching the dishes or distracting yourself so the kind of first pass that we'll take at it is Trying to see what being emotionally supportive to yourself looks like so we try to see okay What's the gap between what you would say to yourself and what you would say to a friend in this kind of scenario? And usually the friend isn't just kind of permissive It's not like oh you feel afraid of like writing this essay Go ahead and not write it the the friend will and the friend isn't going to try to like invalidate those feelings typically Although some clients struggle with that and that's okay The friend's not shape up this So there's there's kind of like reassuring the feelings themselves Whether it's through logic or through some other soothing way to try to make the feelings go away or there's problem solving It's just like oh haven't you thought about doing this that or the other thing? And both of those tend not to work very well when it comes to emotional procrastination because it's the emotions that are the problem um And or the emotions that are getting in the way they're not necessarily the problem so when you have an emotion like like fear or whatever you want to try to Validate that fear and basically say it's okay to feel fear And it doesn't have to be that formal. It can be kind of a casual like that's rough buddy or or what have you? um one additional trick to this that i've noticed is when people Write out the dialogue that they're having with themselves when they're emotionally procrastinating It's a lot easier to see the brain tricking itself because sometimes it'll be harder to get in touch with the emotions It'll it'll be like a oh I feel like and then offer some analysis or I feel that and then offer some analysis Instead of offering an actual feeling the third type of procrastination is Operational procrastination. So the classic thing where this happens the most I think is taxes where Taxes for most people aren't necessarily that complicated. It's not like it's going to provoke a whole lot of painful feelings It's just that there's so many elements to the task that your brain just kind of goes. I don't know where to start and um so the kind of first pass at that is kind of pretending that your head is cut off and then like observing your body and then All you can do is tell your body Very like literal things like what's the next concrete actions when it comes to doing taxes because doing taxes isn't really doable When your brain's overwhelmed like this, it's like oh open your laptop Okay, open your tab to free tax usa or like whatever just the next concrete actions that aren't moving into the future by like you know more than 90 seconds or so or even then and if the task is if um yeah, and then if if there's trouble there like you're it's hard to explain this but Like it's really easy for the mind when people try to avoid operational procrastination It's really easy for the mind to end up creating a task that's actually too abstract for the mind to handle the mind Can't handle that much of abstract tasks. It's like, you know, our working memory can only hold like three to seven things at a time um, and even then it's kind of switching back and forth between the two so a lot of it is kind of dealing with the shame of You know, oh, what does this say about me that I can't do this task or I have trouble Operationalizing when there's actually nothing wrong with you. It's just kind of like how the mind works So hopefully hopefully those first passes help I will say that um, we typically expect The those kinds of solutions to work a lot better Once people are more in the action phase of coaching as opposed to the emotional or understanding phase just as a caveat Awesome So I have a scenario for you that's based on a question somebody asked in chat So somebody comes to you as a client and they're like I want to study for eight hours How do I do that? How do you sort of coach them through that or what's your or what's your response? So that's a great question. So the first thing I would ask is um, Where did you get the idea that studying for eight hours is the right way to go? so for some people that is the great idea, but like dr k studied for I think it was two hours or so in medical school And then we can once once I understand where they're coming from Then I can start to maybe Yeah, once I understand where they're coming from on that then it would just depend on actually, let me think about how to structure this in my mind because That alan is saying he wants to think for a second. Yeah So I think that part of the issue is that I would just need to um Know if the client is actually in the bucket where stuff For eight hours for them would be a good idea or are they in a different bucket? so that might have to do with something we call motivational style where some people can kind of Naturally focus for long periods of time like, you know, eight hours 10 hours whenever and other people can't I think um Whichever strategy we end up taking I would want to start working with their mind rather than against it And I would just sort of ask them about some of their intuitions like In addition to where they got the idea that they need to study for eight hours Like what actually feels like something you could pull off or what you would naturally do And and this is a case where I might draw on a little bit of the action phase During the emotional phase because they might be in a position where they're in academic triage mode So if that's the case, um, I might like introduce something that like the one fourth rule like pretty early So coaching isn't exactly designed to like Help people in a crisis right away when they're in academic probation, but we can kind of give it a shot and um Let's see Yeah, and uh, other than that I would just um Yeah, I would really need to understand more about the client like what their ideas are behind like do they think it's because they're not disciplined Do they think it's because they're lazy or like whatnot and part of it would also depend on the subject they're studying So yeah, we would see Awesome, um, so I think this is actually a really good question for the context of group coaching. Um, how do you identify your own biases? So, um So when I think about some of the work on cognitive biases Um part of the strength of group is that it counts it accounts for the fact that we can't So, uh, if you want to learn about cognitive biases, I would recommend And I think dr case recommended this to a book called thinking fast and slow by daniel conamit so he was one of the researchers that um kind of discovered or at least like like um Well, you could quibble with the word discovered but he really kind of put cognitive biases as we know them today on the map and uh, and he's is um his partner amos chersky and um one of the things that uh, they'll say is that the there's something about a So so we learn kind of like critical thinking skills so we can you can you can learn like a list of cognitive biases But that's not quite good enough because When your mind is making a mistake that's a cognitive bias or Make even making a mistake that's sort of a random error your mind can't really realize That it's making a mistake while it's making a mistake So one of the major light bulb moments in group is when They can't you can't see your own biases But you can recognize your bias in yourself when you see what the other person is doing and you see how biased they are So I think that um in terms of recognizing their own biases i'm a little bit skeptical about Individuals ability to do that in the moment Or or in ways that don't like miss a lot I mean you can uncover some like through reflection or like meditation for yourself by like strengthening your frontal lobes I think the best thing is having someone there to help you Ideally a group of people to help you but we also do that in like one-on-one coaching, too We're just kind of like reflecting so people can actually see their own biases Yeah, great question, I think I think their exact quote was uh, something like the the the the idea of a Individual critical thinker is somewhat mythical Um, so another really good question and I think something that we see pretty much all the time in Coaching whether it's personal or group But someone's asking all my goals stemmed from my personal bias But someone's asking all my goals stem from fear, what do I do? Where do I move? So the short answer would be toward the fear Right. So so I think technically the the goals wouldn't necessarily stem from the fear itself The fear is there and then there's another part of your mind that we'd call the hum car or the ego that can Take that fear and try to move away from the fear by coming up with all kinds of comparisons Like feelings of superiority and inferiority or even kind of like bullying your logic into coming up with reasons why it's right So I think the process of distinguishing like and that's one of the models that we use is actually like the vedic model of the mind So like how do we account for the fact that our mind has contradictory thoughts? so it's like Do we have other like multiple people in our minds that are arguing with each other like sort of So we've got kind of like our body or kind of like logical mind We've got our manas or our emotional mind and we've got our hum car or our ego We've got other parts of our mind too, but those are kind of the main three and like trying to distinguish those And getting a sense of which thought is coming from where is a key part of observation And it's what we're there to practice doing whether we're in group coaching or whether in personal coaching We're physical trainers for the mind in that way Awesome Would you also talk a bit about the four sources of motivation and how that ties into this? Because I imagine and there's a lot of questions about this is how do I find like what I actually want to do versus What I am motivated to do by other factors that I would like to sort of Not have Yeah, so I think the the main factor that we have for Moving from kind of the should or want part of the graph To the kind of values and duties part of the graph is coaching itself and even if you're kind of like coaching yourself, so When we start to like ask open-ended questions or or reflectively listen and really get people to articulate What's going on in them? We get more information about which parts of the mind are active And then once we see how those parts of the mind are interacting with each other Then we can see which intentions are coming from where? And Eventually people can actually feel it on a physical level and people learn to turn of like test and trust their instincts in terms of what's aligned with their values like what they really care about and what's aligned with Something like that's more ephemeral like their wants or just kind of like short-term I mean there are kind of little tips and tricks that we can use like You know if you ask someone what what do you really care about and someone says? Oh, I care about playing video games for example, which we typically think about as a desire rather than like a value Like is it the case that you're going to care about video games five years from now 10 years from now? Probably not like like if that's all you did for the next five years for the next 10 years and so I I think that how it really relates is that one sort of like leads into the other so that the Um better work that you do through the emotional phase and the more kind of rapport you build with your fellow group members and your coach um, you know if you're in one-on-one then the more you'll be able to Really harness what we know about how intentions work Awesome, um, so I think similar question How can I solve the issue of feeling lost in life? I have about three options to follow but I just can't decide what to focus on because I have no idea which one of them will succeed So So part of me is a little bit torn because we have a few different models for dealing with this So for example, if you were in career coaching, we would probably use something called rap Um, which there's a book about that called decisive that y'all can check out if you want to but um, That's uh Basically like widening your possibilities beyond just like the two or three if possible um attaining or um, Reality testing your assumptions attaining your Attaining detachment and preparing for failure And so we would kind of like walk through that stuff and we tend to draw on that when it comes to more career oriented decisions When it comes to feeling lost in life in general um, we want to try to start with um, I mean, I guess there's a few different angles we can go with it So if I wanted to use the vedic model of the mind I would try to get a sense of like where does feeling lost in life come from because one thing that ego can do Is it can give us something like I I have a feeling like I feel like I am lost in life When we ask people how they're feeling but that's not actually getting it like what the emotion is And so then we can kind of like ask Again and again in different ways to get underneath the kind of a hum car and process that so people can process the emotions Alternatively, we can just you know, do a sort of similar process but in a more indirect way just through like motivational interviewing So that's the technique of like using these reflective listening or asking open-ended questions to find out more about just where you're coming from So we can like bring some of your the the answers that you need to the surface And then get you moving from kind of like stage One or stage two pre-contemplative and contemplative to you know, uh planning and action So one thing i'd be really cautious about Is assuming that the solution to your feeling lost in slight in life is outside of yourself You want to see like what's going on inside? Like where did that feeling come from? How long have you felt that way? that kind of stuff Yeah, great questions Yeah, so generally speaking in group how often or not how often but how much time do you see? sort of people Taking to go through these changes and how long do you sort of see results for clients? So I think we actually have data on this so for group in particular unless something has changed um, it normally takes about 12 weeks to move through 12 to 16 weeks to move through what we'd call the emotional phase So the reason it can take that long is that like literally we're literally Rewiring different neurons in the brain as we're doing these kind of activities. It's like exercise to a certain extent um And sometimes it can take a little bit longer. Sometimes it can take a little bit shorter, but I think that's the average Oh Awesome. And yeah, just also set expectations. This kind of varies like Alan said So depending on your issue with I think that ties into the next question Depending on your issue depending on sort of where you're at that could take longer or shorter Especially depending on the kind of coaching But yeah, I think that has into the next question So someone asked how do you know if you should do coaching therapy or speak with a mentor? So, I mean when it comes to coaching versus therapy Therapy is if you're concerned about having a kind of medical issue or you need medical treatment So if you think for example that You have depression you think maybe this is kind of like clinical depression. It's not just depression That's congruent with my life, but I might need medical treatment for it The answer is to go to the doctor and see if you need medical treatment I think that Dr. K does have a Guide to finding a therapist and I think there are maybe in other places. He recommends just getting like a general checkup Like you would at a doctor's office to see like okay like what's going on with me if I get like a medical Evaluation like is this something that seems like it requires medical attention or is this something that can be solved subclinical? Because that's what coaching is really focused on is subclinical When it comes to mentorship I know that as coaches were not Your mentors, but I would say what I just said about coaching would also apply to mentors as well So it comes to like a Medical issue or something that and if you're not sure like where the difference is you would defer to a therapist So, you know and we as coaches try to be a little bit informed about this too Where we have mental health consultants who? Can give us kind of like education about this stuff so that we're trying with that so that we're kind of moving forward in a way That's unlikely to You know inflame people's Mental health issues. So for example, if you're a therapist and you're a therapist You're not sure where the difference is People's Mental health issues. So for example, we have like a trauma informed coach who's on our scientific or Trauma coach who's actually on our scientific advisory board and other licensed mental health professionals including dr Kay teach us about trauma, but we're kind of like a physical trainer who? Knows a little bit about the injuries and how not to flare up flare up the knee injury If the knee injury actually flares up and you need surgery on your knee you would need a doctor for that So hopefully that kind of makes sense So there's a lot of different resources that go into more detail too about The differences between coaching and therapy on our channel and on the website, too Awesome Um, so someone is asking how do you deal with obsession with productivity? Sometimes I struggle to focus and work and then end up guilty and upset with myself and I can't allow myself to play Chill or watch a movie even on weekends Um So that's an interesting question because it's almost like there's a uh Upset there's like okay. I have an obsession about productivity How can I be productive about this and like solve that problem right away to make sure that i'm not? Um, I can be as productive as possible and figuring out how to not be productive um so I think um Yeah, I mean it's tough to answer that question because I think it varies so much depending on the client because there's a lot of different things that can get people obsessed with productivity and um I think the the main thing I would wonder about is where does the label of obsession come from? Like like what what do you when you use the word obsession? How are you defining that term because that that could also Um, you know influence how we might want to approach it or like which models I would want to draw on as a coach Um Someone's asking I set goals and make lists all the time, but I can't do any of them for some reason What do you think could be going on? Well, I know I mentioned the stages of change model and the um The kind of drive matrix model sort of four quadrants one and both of them have potential explanations for what could be going on um I I would think uh One thing that I would try to ask that is a little bit outside of some of those models in some ways is When you make lists Or when you set goals, what is that like for you? So if there's anything that People are doing where they kind of recognize that what they're doing isn't really that great or really that Or something they want to continue doing I want to ask like what what is that like because oftentimes it can feel good in ways that people don't want to acknowledge so if somebody like Drinks and they're like it's ruining my life And we'll try to ask them like like what feels good about drinking it and I would that would be one That I would have is like what what feels good about like making lists? And you know if if there's some kind of like feeling underneath there like we would find out but that'd be one place where I Would try to start taking Um, so this has come up quite often One even when we talk about stages of change there's this first step of understanding and a big part of that looks like sort of building emotional awareness um, could you talk a little bit about how Somebody in group or personal starts to do that and what the process for building emotional intelligence Um So I think the process of emotional intelligence um Is tricky in part because there's a lot that we don't actually know about emotions. So For example what an emotion is so there's a few different theories of emotions out there But there's no as far as I know scientific consensus about what an emotion actually is What we do know about emotions or what's generally agreed upon is that they're kind of automatic responses There's a lot of information both kind of like physical and mental and the emotion labels that we put These kind of physical and mental sensations Are what we would call emotions So we would try to look out for kind of like physical feelings and also different things that could get in the way of Getting in touch with those physical feelings So if somebody plays video games all the time or distracts themselves from their emotions That's going to suppress your amygdala and hippocampus And then you were not going to be able to really feel your emotions You're going to have what we'd call alexithymia or kind of like emotional color blindness So we look at kind of internal factors. Like what what do you actually think about your emotions? What have you been taught about your emotions? Where did some of those ideas come from? What do you actually think about them? You know, don't just tell me the textbook right answer that you might have heard from dr k or whoever But like what what do you actually think? What's your intuitions and we'll look at the external factors, too Cool awesome So next question, I think you'll like this one because they already seem to understand the stages stages of change Um, they're asking what are your strategies for managing relapse or recurrence in the stages slash cycle cycle of change? So I would say that varies pretty widely And uh, this is also Trying to think about how to say this in a way that doesn't it's not too wordy So I think that's probably one of my favorite parts of coaching So once you get through the kind of like action phase of coaching there's kind of an integrative phase where you know when when people show up to coaching we want to try to like build an eclectic model together, but there's You know not as much like building particular tasks or assignments together And so I think that's when you get into just really granular territory At least in my experience where how one person's mind works when they're kind of deeper into the integrative phase They don't struggle as much with you know emotions and taking actions And then they can like kind of really take off it, but that that's over the long term When it comes to the the relapse so when it comes to the Relapse How should I put this so I would say that one thing I would want to define is what What the person means by relapse and what's the difference between a lapse and a relapse if any and also like what does a relapse mean to you and then If you know you consider it a failure in some way We can kind of be aware of the emotions and figure out the way to manage them Because the more you care about it the more you seem to make process the more subtle and difficult the emotions can get Um, and another thing I would want to try to say is so we try not to lean on reassurance too much in coaching Especially at first but I do find a little bit of reassurance can kind of go a long way so it's completely normal in coaching like once or even if you're outside of coaching if you're just trying to Build structures around yourself that help you manage your emotions or build an external brain or whatever It's normal for when you're around week I think it's six or seven in personal and maybe like 10 or 11 in group to actually feel worse and that's because Your your chitta your your unconscious is kind of assessing the situation. It goes. Oh, there's Actually a space now that we can process like a lot of these emotions let's take all this stuff that's been, you know, repressed in the past and just kind of like dump it on the Uh the the pilot now the client now Um, so, uh, yeah, that's that's generally the way that I would approach it Oh Just want to take a second to check in with chat. Um, how are you all feeling any specific questions coming to mind? scrolling through Uh, but i'm also wondering now that you've mentioned some scars, um, I know people are interested in that concept So if you want to do like a really brief one-minute summary I think that could be cool. Um, and I know members will be excited for that because they've been Watching that for a bit recently So when we think about the vedic model of the mind there's a few different parts of it So we've mentioned both the or like the logical part of the mind manas or the emotional part of the mind and ego Um, and what the ego is is actually a collection of some scars So that is an undigested set of not just emotions but also kind of like beliefs and physical sensations that are kind of frozen and amber in time to the point where Uh, your they're they're stored in the unconscious and then kind of brought back to the surface when you encounter that scenario again The classic example, dr. Gay gives is like a fear of dogs So if there's someone who's like four or five years old and they get bit by a dog They don't have the capacity to process all of those emotions because it's like basically physically impossible And what they need is they need ice cream So like you you you pick them up you give them a hug you give them ice cream They kind of forget about the dog and then the next time they see a dog all that unprocessed stuff kind of like comes to the surface again and so then a lot of what we do in coaching is Help people kind of process some of these some scars and like help them look for them basically Yeah, great question Oh, yeah, just sort of curiosity how much of the problems that people sort of face and the things they come for in coaching How much of those are some scars? Uh the rough estimation So i'm gonna say 99 percent. Um, and the only reason i'm saying 99 is because I don't feel comfortable saying 100 percent um, so like yeah, like I think there's a big difference between what's um Natural for us as human beings and what's habitual and like what we've been habituated into is really um Quite bad for our mental health for the most part It provokes a lot that just creates a lot of different some scars Oh Well, I think that's most of the questions that we've had today we are almost up on time So just want to take some time to wrap up Um, could you talk just a little bit about your experience as a coach alan and you know what that's like and how you feel about it? Yeah, well, um, so I love being in a position to contribute to other people's lives and it's been um, really awesome to um See people at all the different stages of coaching You know sometimes There are clients who don't quite kind of get the results that we would like But one thing that's really cool about our organization is that when coaching doesn't really seem to work for someone they get a call and like we try to collect as much data we can about what works and what doesn't and so um, it's really cool when I step into a session with a client not just to feel like i'm just trying to help them myself but that Me and all of my colleagues or mental health consultants and um, Dr. K and you know all of y'all who are like filling out surveys and giving us feedback on like the subreddit and stuff like that Even if you're on a coaching You know, well, I guess I don't really have very good words for it. It's just like a lot of really positive feelings and um, i'm just really glad to be able to talk about that today with you all and um, You know, I hope it was helpful Awesome, well I share the sentiment. Thank you so much everybody in chat for your awesome awesome questions um, if any of this was helpful, that would be awesome, um, and we are Uh, we have group spots open. So if you want to sign up, um, you can check out the website healthygamer.gg um And yeah, thanks so much for coming Thanks everybody, uh questions anyone before we wrap up? Are we good? Oh, actually final question for you. Alan. What made you want to become a coach? Uh, well, um, I was working, uh in um a few different political contexts and I was really um Troubled by The degree to which the mental health of not just staff members, but also candidates are taken for granted um, and I could really see how that impacts policy and it didn't really seem like therapy was the solution especially for some of the stuff that people were struggling with like burnout and you know imposter syndrome, which there's some therapists who are equipped to deal with those but Even though there's a lot of studies on burnout itself um That's not like part of the standard training for like a typical psychiatrist is like how do you deal with burnout? so we're doing those studies and um so anyway when I just looked for who in the um, you know mental health space is focused on subclinical mental health, um, I found hg and I thought that um, coaching would be A really great way to contribute to other people's lives and use a lot of the talents that i'd been given And um, yeah, it's just it's just been very fulfilling Awesome. Well, thank you for sharing um And yeah Just to kind of the reason I asked that question was just to kind of illustrate which chat that coaches pretty much come from all walks of life and everybody has different life experiences, but like We'll just go through like the same curriculum built by dr. K And like it's really about the methodology and there's a lot of diversity here um, but yeah, thanks so much everyone and Take care. We'll see you when we see you next. Dr. K will replace us as the streamer next time Cool. Thanks everyone You You
