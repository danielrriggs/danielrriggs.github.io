Different perspectives on motivation -
Neuroscience - People do brain scans to figure out what motivates people to do an action.
Addiction psychiatrists - sit with people struggling to overcome a substance.
Advertising - people are trying to figure out, what motivates people to spend $?
Global Macro Trends - Behavioral Economics - economists are trying to figure out what causes the stock market to move?

What is motivation? There is no Sanskrit word for motivation.
It's an emergent property; it isn't a discrete thing. It happens, or arises, out of other factors.

Motivation is individualized. Despite all the science we have, no scientific paper will perfectly explain to you how you work. We can understand principles of neuroscience & psychology, but it may not all apply to you. You'll have to figure out what resonates with you and set aside that which doesn't.

"Good diagnosis precedes good treatment." We need to understand the nature of motivation before we can get to solutions.

What we call motivation has 3 discrete components:
We need to optimize all 3.
1) Intent - we may have goals in life, but we don't tunnel down enough on why it's a goal. 
	- Half the reason we don't do what we're *supposed* to do is because we actually don't really are about it. If the goal comes from outside of us, then chances are it will be hard to get motivated towards it. What goes into the intent of a goal? If we can optimize our intent, we can build a powerful *why* that helps us move forward.
2) Resistance - even if I've decided I have an important goal; I've discarded all of my conditioned goals, we can still fail to bring ourselves to execute on a well reasoned goal (authentic goal).
	- Resistances comes from 2 major places:
		- Emotions 
			- ex: a lonely person has a well reasoned desire for companionship, but emotional blockage prevents them from going out).
		- [[Ego|Ahamkara]]. Our sense of identity can hold us back.
			- If I view myself as lazy, what does that do for my chance of success? It reduces the possibility for success & decreases motivation. Our brain doesn't do things it thinks will fail. We only engage in tasks we think will be successful. In this case, we need to let go of part of our identity.
3) Action
	- The [[Frontal lobes]] take an abstract goal (like, throw a party) & breaks it down into bitesize pieces. Sometimes the brain doesn't know how to break up a larger goal we set for ourselves. The hardest step is usually getting started.
		- Practical techniques on how to set good goals.
		- How to operationalize tasks.
		- How to cultivate an environment that cultivates motivation.
		- How to set good technology habits.

Motivation isn't something you can increase.
	*Analogy - like flight for a bird. Is flight in the bones? In the wings? In the feathers? Is it the height that the bird starts from? Is it the wind that's blowing? Flight includes all of these components.*
	When we try to just "do stuff" (motivate ourselves), we're looking for "flight" without understanding the elements of flight.

We're need to figure out which of these things applies to me.
Is the reason I'm not motivated because my goals are internalized from parental expectation? Then no wonder you don't want to do it.
Is the reason you can't act because you're ashamed of yourself? Or that you'll look like an idiot? That comes from your [[Ego]]; no wonder you can't act.
Or do you not act because your goal is so abstract that your brain doesn't know what to do - "I need to find a purpose." How are you even supposed to get started on that?
