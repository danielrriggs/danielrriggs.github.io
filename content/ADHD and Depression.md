- People with ADHD are **five** times as likely to be [[Depression|depressed]].
- They're also **five** times as likely to be [[Suicide|Suicidal]].
- They're **three** times as likely to commit [[Suicide]].

- Based on epidemiologic studies, [[ADHD]] has a causative effect for [[Depression]].
If you take 100 kids with depression, 2.7% of them will grow up to have ADHD. On the other hand, if you were born with ADHD or you get diagnosed with ADHD in childhood, there's a 50-70% chance that in adulthood you'll have depression. That is a staggering correlation, and sort of suggests that something about ADHD in childhood leads to depression in adulthood. We have plenty of research that sort of helps us sketch out how having ADHD as a child makes you more likely to be depressed as an adult. It starts with the brain.

What are the core features of ADHD that predispose people to [[depression]]?
- Inattention
	- *Inattentive kids underperform at school. Then they get yelled at at home. And they have social problems (space out of conversations).*
- Emotional Dysregulation
	- *They have temper tantrums more; get into fights more.*
- Impulsivity
	- *They get in trouble more (yelled at).*

Features connecting [[ADHD]] & [[Depression]]:
- Academic underachievement
- Social isolation
- Discordant relationships
- High IQ + [[ADHD]] = "do better, try harder to be normal / apply yourself" > leads to formation of "something's wrong with me" [[Ego|identity]], which results in feelings of [[Shame]], then [[Loneliness]]. As you avoid (stop going to things), stop caring about things, & isolate, you set yourself up for [[Depression]]. 

###### Ways to manage emotions
- Develop [[Adaptations]] to compensate from having less emotional control. One of them is [[Avoidance]]. Developing [[Avoidance]] to protect themselves from emotional pain.
- [[Suppression]] is rarely used by kids or adults with [[ADHD]].
- [[Cognitive reframing]] - the healthiest way to manage emotions. If you aren't taught how to do this, someone with [[ADHD]] may never learn how to do it. This is what a therapist does. They'll teach people how to [[Cognitive reframing|Cognitively reframe]].

This situation may seem impossible; that thought may be a consequence of the [[Ego|identity]] you've formed. The different seeds of [[Depression]] give us a roadmap to diagnose & treat your actual problem.

###### What to do if you have ADHD & Depression
- First, forgive yourself
- Second, understand yourself
	- *The problems that you face are not random or out of your control They can be scientifically traced and understood. Once we understand it, we can start to act on it.*
- Third, get help. [[ADHD]] is isolating; kids with [[ADHD]] are in discordant relationships.
