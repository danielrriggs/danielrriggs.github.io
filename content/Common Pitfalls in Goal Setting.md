Before focusing on how to accomplish our goals, we need to be critical about how we set them in the first place.

 **The most common pitfalls people fall into when setting goals are:**

- **Compensatory goals:** Trying to **overcompensate** for **past** failures by setting unrealistic goals.
	- *These goals are born of emotion. Be careful of goals born of shame and resentment. We're trying to fix an internal emotion with these kinds of goals through a sense of triumph.*
	- *A goal that is all or nothing can encourage the mind to quit instead of encouraging us to continue.*
- **Fantasy-based goals:** Setting goals that are based on unrealistic **expectations** or dreams.
	- A dream (desire) that's translated into too high of a practical goal does not encourage us to move forward.
	- Neuroscience: The reinforcement for actual progress doesn't reinforce our motivation. It does the opposite.
		- Video games do the opposite of a fantasy goal - they give you lots of tiny (artificial, positive) reinforcement. Every step is progress towards ... maybe even no end goal.
- **Moving goalposts:** Continuously increasing the difficulty of a goal after achieving initial success, leading to eventual failure due to excessive expectations.
	- Sabotages your ability to be consistent (consistency is most important).
