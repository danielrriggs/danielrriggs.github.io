Clean Your Room

Pick up the heaviest thing and carry it

The Pareto distribution seems to apply to everything, including the distribution of stars in the universe

You don't know what you are up to

Be careful about good intentions - they aren't sufficient to do good

What would it be like if you embodied what you say you believe

Your actions reflect your belief, not your words

What you do matters

No one ever gets away with anything

Do not let your kids do anything that makes you dislike them

If you can think speak and write, you are a monster

Layers of analysis

You have ideas to that they can die so you don’t have to

Stories are not arbitrary

If you were in Nazi Germany, You’d be a guard at the camps

The ideological fights of the 20th century have an answer with respect to good and evil

Facing your fears is a way to transform yourself to grow bigger than your problems

Burn off the dead wood to build anew

Do not lie

Women terrify men

Be precise in your speech

People need so little encouragement

Kids need rough and tumble play

Speech is thinking, free speech is free thought
