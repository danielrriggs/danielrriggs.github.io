When we're in limbo, we aren't paralyzed by fear, we're paralyzed by our attachment to the positive potential we have created in our mind. As long as we're in limbo, the positive story in our mind has a chance of surviving. **The paralysis is born of the strength of your love.**

Overcoming this [[Samskara]] doesn't just involve overcoming a negative emotion. It actually involves overcoming a positive emotion. Taking a risk means accepting that things may not work out. If you're stuck in limbo, you need to first let go of the positive & mourn the death of your positive dream. Paradoxically, the more you can let go of the possibility of the positive, the more free you are to act. We can work on conquering the negative emotions, too, but the most important thing with this [[Samskara]] (and the aspect that is often overlooked), is detaching from the positive emotion.

###### Key steps:
- Recognize the [[Samskara]]'s action in the present.
	- *How do you feel (about yourself, others)? What do you want? What's holding you back? Look for positive emotion in addition to negative emotion.*
- Get to the source of the attachment / hope.
	- *Where did it come from?*
