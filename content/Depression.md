Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by persistent sadness or low mood for at least two weeks at a time and lasting up until about a year.

###### Statistics
1 out of 3 adults will experience [[Depression]] at some point in their life.  It usually starts around puberty, but then strikes most heavily between the ages of 18 and 29. From a gender standpoint, women are anywhere between two to three times as likely to experience major depressive disorder, but personally I think the number is far closer to like one-to-one. If you look at studies, it appears that men are far less likely to engage with mental health professionals and treatment. So my guess is that there's a large number of men with major depressive disorder who simply haven't been diagnosed. From a genetic perspective, if you have a nuclear family member, so like either parent, child or sibling with depression, you're about twice as likely to get it yourself, which still means that the majority of people with family members with depression are still fine.

There are 2 "buckets" of disorders that can lead to depression - mood disorders, and personality disorders.
#### Mood Disorders
###### Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) Diagnosis
Someone needs five out of these nine symptoms, including sadness, for at least two weeks.
**Mental Symptoms:**
- Low mood (feeling down, sad, irritable, or angry).
- Anhedonia (decreased interest or lack of enjoyment in activities).
- Negative self-attitude (guilt, worthlessness, hopelessness)
- Suicidal thinking
- Low concentration
**Physical Symptoms:**
- Low energy, fatigue
- Changes in appetite (increased or decreased)
- Changes in sleep (insomnia, hypersomnia, early morning awakening)
	- The most specific sleep pattern in MDD is early morning awakening (Waking up at 4-5 AM with racing thoughts).
- Psychomotor changes (restlessness, slowed movements)

Clinical Depression is an **episodic**, **unipolar** (unipolar, meaning always toward the depressive side; as opposed to a bipolar disorder, for example) illness. An episode of depression lasts anywhere for two weeks to up to about a year. Even clinical depression will get better on its own without treatment. Clinical depression may be caused by a neurochemistry imbalance and the body may take a few months to recalibrate back to normal.

Depression is characterized by weeks of feeling sad, low energy. It will actually get better with time.

Medications are aimed at reducing the duration, frequency, and severity of the depressive episode (shorter, less painful, occur less often).

[[Congruent Depression]] (Non-Clinical depression) has a different set of solutions.

Changing something about your life may not actually change clinical depression.

Clinical depression responds to treatment; things like: medication, psychotherapy, mind-body practices like [[Yoga]], exercise and nutrition. It doesn't necessarily mean fixing the problem that your mind perceives. The whole point in clinical depression is that your mind is actually malfunctioning. It's creating problems that may not actually exist.

[[Dysthymia]] is what [[Psychiatry]] calls [[Congruent Depression]], or, what Bhudda calls [[Dukkha]].

###### Personality Disorders
Personality disorders are a common cause for depression, but aren't necessarily responsive to the treatments for depression. Adverse experiences in younger years can shape a person's personality / psyche which wires them in a way to make them vulnerable to depression.
Example of this:
- [[Borderline Personality Disorder]] - isn't episodic. MDD creates a neurochemistry imbalance which you can then rebalance. Someone with BPD is wired differently.
