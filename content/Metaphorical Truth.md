The quality of an explanation where the explanation, if acted in accordance with, allows a replicator to be better at replicating than if the explanation wasnâ€™t acted in accordance with. Metaphorical truth is orthogonal to literal truth, meaning that literally true explanations can be either metaphorically true or metaphorically false without their literal veracity being affected.
