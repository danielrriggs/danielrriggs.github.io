Researchers studying the link between [[ADHD]] and [[Depression]] found three factors which linked the two:
- Academic underachievement
- Discordant relationships
- Emotional regulation
	- Emotions get out of control, which can lead to [[Depression]] in adulthood. Depression manifests as powerlessness, hopelessness, a lack of motivation, a very low self-esteem, negative self-worth, low self-attitude.

Children with ADHD are less likely to be invited to birthday parties.
Kids with ADHD develop into adults with low [[low self-esteem]].

Impulsivity, inattention, and inability to regulate emotions cause problems.

What was born as a seed of shame then becomes a tree, and then becomes a gigantic tree, and it bears flower and fruit and grows more and more trees, and then you wind up as an adult with depression.
