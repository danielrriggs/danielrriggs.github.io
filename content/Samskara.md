A collection of experiences and undigested emotional energy that gets stored in your mind.

A memory impression. Thought generating machines that live in our [[Citta]] which generates thoughts at the right time.

In the east, they understand the western term "[[Personality]]" as a collection of samskaras.

A lot of what hold us back and propel us forward are samskaras.

Samskaras can exist to protect us in some way.
- *For example, we may have an attribute of our identity which prevents us from looking at other parts of ourselves.*

Our [[Citta]] has a storehouse of all of our samskaras. The [[Buddhi]] is constantly scanning for the appropriate samskara to use in a given environment.
- *For example, if I have a phobia of dogs because I was bitten by a dog as a child, that samskara isn't going to be active when I'm riding on the subway. But the moment the doors open and a guy with a big dog walks onto the subway, it's activated. The [[Buddhi]] calls up negative emotional energy, in this case.*

A samskara is like a memory folder in your [[Mind]] with lots of files which are your prior experiences that share a common thread. If you have some negative experiences with dogs and some positive experiences with dogs, you can feel both negative and positive emotional energy. Like, wanting to pet it, but also some fear.

Samskaras retain the emotional age at which we had the experience. We may grow up, but it gets saved in the [[Mind]] in the current form.
In psychiatry, there's an emotional defense mechanism called [[Regression (psychology)|regression]]. This is caused by [[Samskara]]s activation. Your [[Mind]] can get transported back to a previous point in time.

Sometimes in therapy, we examine memories to bring them from primitive stages to more mature stages, thereby processing them.

Oftentimes a samskara is at the root of [[Resistance|self-sabotage]].
- *Example: Someone who's been abandoned before behaves insecurely in a relationship & then, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy & the partner breaks up with them, and the samskara gets strengthened even more*

Samskaras are responsible for what we call [[Personality]] (traits) in the West. ("*I'm lazy; I'm undisciplined; I'm unlovable; I won't be able to be as good as this other person*")
It's also responsible for positive things in our mind; like a cancer survivor oftentimes is left with a powerful positive samskara. "If I've beaten cancer, I can beat this, too".

###### How to digest negative samskaras
You have to be able to define & find a samskara to start working with it. This is done by paying attention to your emotional state. There may be times in your life where you respond disproportionately to a situation.

Attacking a samskara ("that's not true, that's not true, that's not true") backfires & actually hardens the samskara. Our [[Ego|ahamkara]] is stronger than our [[Buddhi]], so no amount of logic will be able to unpack it. Instead of trying to convince yourself you can still be successful despite the samskara, you need to figure out what the samskara is protecting your from.

**First**, **notice** the samskara in the present. Try to understand the features of it.
- *Example: I'm feeling afraid, abandoned, ashamed; physically, my stomach is queasy, I feel like throwing up, I don't feel hungry. There can be mental sensations & physical sensations.*
Remember that this is emotional energy which is carried over from the past, so there will be times in your life where you felt that same way.

The **next** step is to ask yourself, "when have I felt this way before"? If you're really careful, you may find some weird examples of when you felt that way.
- *Example: After soccer practice, you were the last kid there & your coach needed to leave & you were left wondering if my parents are ever going to come pick me up? You felt fear, ashamed, queasy in the stomach. That's an instance of something being added to that "folder" of abandonment.*
In psychiatry & therapy, they train in common experiences. Therapy works by digesting samskaras.

Sometimes when you re-examine prior experiences, as you recall those memories, the feelings will actually return (in the present). As you bring up that emotion, **watch it**. Every time you **bring the emotion into the present and observe it**, it actually melts away; it's like you're deleting a "file" from your samskara "folder" and the samskara gets a little bit weaker.

This process can be facilitated by therapy, coaching, journaling, or meditation

The key thing is that you have to feel the feelings in the present and then let it go & metabolize it.

###### How to implant positive samskaras
Just like negative samskaras, positive samskaras come from powerful emotional experiences.

When the [[Mind]] is "one-pointed", a samskara can move past the surface layers of the [[Mind]] and implant deeply in the unconscious. If we think about a traumatic experience, we are so intensely focused on it that the [[Mind]] is" one-pointed." If we can train our minds to be still and send a message into the depths of the unconscious, then a positive samskara will arise.

Do [[Yoga Nidra]] to achieve a deep state of relaxation. Then, when you're very very calm, take a [[Sankalpa]] & plant it deep into your unconscious.
