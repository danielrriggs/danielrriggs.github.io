Use Case Guidelines: **INVEST**
Independent. This means that you can schedule and implement each user story separately. This is very helpful if you implement continuous integration processes.
Negotiable. This means that all parties agree to prioritize negotiations over specification. This also means that details will be created constantly during development.
Valuable. A story must be valuable to the customer.  You should ask yourself from the customer’s perspective “why” you need to implement a given feature.
Estimable. A quality user story can be estimated. This will help a team schedule and prioritize the implementation. The bigger the story is, the harder it is to estimate it.
Small. Good user stories tend to be small enough to plan for short production releases. Small stories allow for more specific estimates.
Testable. If a story can be tested, it’s clear enough and good enough. Tested stories mean that requirements are done and ready for use.
