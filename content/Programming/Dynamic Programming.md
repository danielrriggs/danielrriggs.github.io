Top down or Bottom Up

- Combines the correctness of **brute force** and the efficiency of greedy algorithms
- Common use cases:
	- Finding an optimal solution
	- Counting the total number of solutions for a problem

1) Identify the subproblems to solve
2) Find the base case
3) Find recursive formula for general solution

Add memoization to speed up.
