Aliases: mesolimbic circuit, dopamine circuit, Incentive Reward.

Our **mesolimbic circuit** (found in the [[Nucleus accumbens]]) is our **reward circuit** and is governed by [[Dopamine]]. Sometimes people call also call it the dopamanergic circuit.

We'll have a behavior, get a **reward**, and then *learn* something from it (reinforce that behavior). This is what we call 'learning'.
- **Our mesolimbic circuit governs the relationship between behaviors, rewards, and reinforcement (or, learning).**

###### What happens when you mess with this circuit (with addictions)?
When you use a substance of abuse like cocaine, marijuana, or opiates, there's direct chemical activation of the reward circuit, so our behavior becomes so powerfully reinforced to the point where it overrides everything else.
- *People who are addicted to something like heroin or cocaine can have all kinds of problems - about to lose a job, about to get divorced, are running out of money, getting in trouble with the law, are mortgaging their house, start stealing from people; despite all these negative consequences, they still persist in the behavior. This is because they're directly stimulating this part of the brain.*

[[Dopamine]] is not just about reward and pleasure; it's also about **learning**. We call the process of reinforcing a behavior *learning*.
Once we're addicted to something, we tamper with this circuit, and people don't *learn* from their mistakes.
- *"I'm never drinking again". How often do people learn from that experience?*

#### Technology Use
We're seeing the signs of [[Tolerance]] developing in technology use. We don't actually know this to be true (because there haven't been studies to do biopsies done on people who watch tons of YouTube), but we see all of the effects of physiologic [[Tolerance]] with technology use.
- *Think about binge watching a show / marathon gaming. We binge consume because it engages us so much, but think about the 1st hour of watching / playing vs. the 18th hour. Which hour is more fun? Those later hours are less fun. Despite the fact that it stops being fun & you don't enjoy it at hour 18, you can't seem to stop.*
Nobody plans on waking up on Saturday and wasting 8 hours of their day on the internet (doom scrolling Reddit, binge watching stuff, etc). When you do this, you feel regret at the end of that day. You didn't even have fun, let alone get to any of the work you *should* do. And then you do it the next day all over again. We don't seem to learn from our mistakes, despite making them over and over again. One of the confusing things is that, the most addictive parts of technology aren't even things that feel rewarding at all.

###### The brain has a bias towards negative emotions
The content that rises to the top is the most emotionally engaging / activating. A lot of people assume that 'reward' means positive in some way; but, the emotions that our brain is most concerned with are actually the negative ones. Negative emotions are much more powerful at shaping our behavior. The brains that don't bias towards negative emotions don't survive.

The [[Reward Circuitry|mesolimbic circuit]] can be stimulated by opiates, getting an 'A' on a test, or twitter. As our brains adapt to heavy technology use, that brain has difficulty motivating towards other actions. When you try to read more, you get bored more easily. The reward for reading isn't sufficient compared to browsing social media, which is why you're reaching for it.

###### Hijacked Dopaminergic Circuit signs
- Reaching for Tech constantly
- Increased Use = Less Enjoyment
- Difficulty learning from mistakes
	- Our ability to learn from our mistakes & get positive reinforcement & engage in behaviors we enjoy seems to be messed up. Your brain never adapts. It's always a struggle.

By better understanding the different parts of our brain, we'll better understand how to reset them.
