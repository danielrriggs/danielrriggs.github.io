#### Western Medicine
Western medicine likes to divide and conquer to understanding the smallest piece of things to try to get to the truth of it (where the source of illness is).
- a psychiatrist focuses on the mind,
- a neurologist focuses on the brain, 
- a cardiologist focuses on the heart,
- a pediatrician focuses on children,
- an obstetrician focuses on pregnancy.
Western medicine separates out people from diseases. It's designed to treat diseases, not people.

The gold standard of western medicine is the [[Randomized Controlled Trial]]. It removes individuality (by using populations), to obtain the purest disease process possible (for the population) which then produces the purest treatment possible (for the population). The challenge is that when you take the purest treatment possible and you apply it to a person, it doesn't actually translate one to one because disease exists within a person (not a population).

Ayurveda is about the opposite of dividing & conquering. It's about pattern generation & building things up. Ayurvedic physicians don't try to look at one thing as small as they can. They look at as many different small things as they can and develop an idea of an overarching pattern that encompasses the whole.
