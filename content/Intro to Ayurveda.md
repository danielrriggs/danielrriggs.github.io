#### Western Medicine
Western medicine likes to divide and conquer to understanding the smallest piece of things to try to get to the truth of it (where the source of illness is).
- a psychiatrist focuses on the mind,
- a neurologist focuses on the brain, 
- a cardiologist focuses on the heart,
- a pediatrician focuses on children,
- an obstetrician focuses on pregnancy.
Western medicine separates out people from diseases. It's designed to treat diseases, not people.

The gold standard of western medicine is the [[Randomized Controlled Trial]]. It removes individuality (by using populations), to obtain the purest disease process possible (for the population) which then produces the purest treatment possible (for the population). The challenge is that when you take the purest treatment possible and you apply it to a person, it doesn't actually translate one to one because disease exists within a person (not a population).

Ayurveda is about the opposite of dividing & conquering. It's about pattern generation & building things up. Ayurvedic physicians don't try to look at one thing as small as they can. They look at as many different small things as they can and develop an idea of an overarching pattern that encompasses the whole.

Ayurvedic physicians noticed that certain physical and mental characteristics correlated in people. In an attempt to figure out a language to describe these patterns, they came up with the concept of a [[Dosha]].
- *People with slow metabolisms are more prone to depression.*
- *People with fast metabolisms are more prone to ADHD.*

Everyone has different levels of each of the three [[Dosha]]s: [[Vata]], [[Pitta]], and [[Kapha]],
Everyone has a base level of each of the three [[Dosha]]s, which is called [[Prakruti]]. This is determined at birth.
- *We can't measure a person's [[Dosha|doshic]] levels, but there is some budding research in [[Ayurgenomics]] which is strarting to do some genome analysis on this.*

We have a natural level of each [[Dosha]], and then things like diet, environment, and behaviors can raise or lower each [[Dosha]]. This is called [[Vikruti]]. By controlling these factors, we can imbalance or balance our [[Dosha]]s.
- When [[Vata]] gets too high or too low, it results in [[Vata]] diseases or disturbances.
- When [[Pitta]] gets too high or too low, it results in [[Pitta]] diseases or disturbances.
- When [[Kapha]] gets too high or too low, it results in [[Kapha]] diseases or disturbances.

Â In the Ayurvedic view, disease is fundamentally tied to a person - their individual genetic / [[Dosha]] makeup. The way to attain health is to balance your doshas so that you can get out of disease ranges.

The Ayurvedic view doesn't separate mental & cardiac functions (for example, we know from Western medicine that people with diabetes are more prone to [[Depression]], and that people who are prone to [[ADHD]] are physically restless & tend to have lower weight).
