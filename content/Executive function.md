"Maturity" has a lot to do with the [[Frontal lobes]].
- Execution and planning of tasks
- Organization and prioritization
- Impulse control and directing attention

Our ability to direct and restrain attention largely comes from our [[Frontal lobes]]. my mind's ability to listen and actually do what I tell it to do has to come with the [[Frontal lobes|Frontal lobe]]. The [[Frontal lobes|Frontal lobe]] is the master controller for the other parts of the brain; it's responsible for suppressing or inhibiting other parts of the brain as well (can restrain emotions; has effects on [[Reward Circuitry]]).

- The stronger your [[Frontal lobes|Frontal lobe]], the better your ability to:
	- Direct attention.
	- Inhibit other parts of the brain.
	- Organize.
	- Prioritize.
People with [[ADHD]] are deficient in these abilities.

###### Executive Function Interventions
- You can grow out of [[ADHD]] (your [[Frontal lobes]] strengthen with age).
Research on adult ADHD suggest that it's not binary; for example, like [[Depression]] or allergies, there could be times in life when it's worse. This is good news, because that means that it's preventable.
- Stimulant meditations (boosts transmission in the [[Frontal lobes]]).
- [[Meditation]] - the most overwhelming data for meditation is that it strengthens the [[Frontal lobes|Frontal lobe]]. One of the things [[Meditation]] done in meditation is redirect attention back to one place. The attention deficit part of [[ADHD]] is a [[Frontal lobes|Frontal lobe]] deficit; [[Meditation]] can clearly strengthen this.
- [[Prioritize|prioritization]], [[organization]]
	- [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|CBT]] for [[ADHD]] is like organization and planning skills.
