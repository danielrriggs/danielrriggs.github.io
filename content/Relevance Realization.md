#JohnVervaeke
The process through which a person decides (usually by an act of imposing their will rather than trying to make any sort of bottom-up analysis) which aspects of a potentially infinite number of attributes of any given thing or action to pay attention to as the ones worth being considered, well, relevant. This happens so automatically for a human–sometimes even on the level of pure intuition–that the process is incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to reverse engineer in order to build or train artificial intelligence to optimize.
