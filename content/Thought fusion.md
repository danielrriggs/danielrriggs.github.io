A state of being in which the self becomes one with the thoughts (or, the mind). People fail to appreciate that their thoughts are not actually reality.
	*Example*: Someone with social anxiety gets invited to a party, but they're stuck thinking "no one wants me here, no one wants me here" (they're thinking too much about themselves) & they're losing track of other things, like the fact that they were invited in the first place.
