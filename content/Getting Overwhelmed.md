You aren't a hero in a movie. When things go wrong, you can't just dig deep, work extra hard & beat the setback. In real life, when things go wrong, you are actually just set back.

There's a very, very subtle relationship between motivation and tasks that pile up. As tasks pile up, or as we get closer to a deadline, we'll see sort of a natural increase in our motivation. But if we're not careful, we'll cross this critical point where we start to feel overwhelmed, because now the task is too large.

[[Frontal lobes]] break down & sequence abstract goals. If the task is too big, we need to [[Operationalizing a problem|Operationalize the problem]].

Overwhelm can come from caring about something too much & create task paralysis. The more we care about something, the more perfect it needs to be & the less likely we are to compromise. Harder to compromise = harder to start (because the first shot must be perfect). We can practice [[Vairagya|detachment]] to get started, which is often the hardest part. We need to make appeasement; we don't need to go the whole distance.
