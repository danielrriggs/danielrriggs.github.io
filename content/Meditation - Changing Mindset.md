This isn't a formal meditation practice. It's a technique to change to shift from a [[Fixed mindset]] to a [[Growth mindset]].

First, let's understand how mindset shifts happen. Neurons that fire together, wire together, so our neuronal patterns develop into [[Habit|habits]]. A mindset is a [[Samskara]]. How can we change a mindset? The mind is like a flowing river. We change it the same way we alter the flow of a river. With practice. By very intentional, tiny, tiny movements. The more we practice, the more our neurons will change. How do we do this?

Here's the process:
- 1) First, with tools of [[Awareness]], **catch** the mindset when it comes up.
	- *If we have a [[Fixed mindset]] & encounter a setback it creates a negative emotion.
		- *We know from psychiatry that we reduce negative emotions by validating them, not by resisting / invalidating them.
- 2) **Acknowledge** the mindset when it comes up (your thoughts & feelings). Don't invalidate the way you feel.
	- *"I can understand why you would feel that way" isn't an endorsement. It's an acknowledgement.*
	- *When you validate / acknowledge these emotions, something interestin happens - they actually **decompress**, and it makes it easier for you to shift towards a [[growth mindset]].*
- 3) **Find the "magic words"** which you can **authentically** say to yourself to shift your mindset.
	- The sentences that cause our cognition to be restructured are personalized. It depends what you need to shift. For example, Perfectionism? Comparison? Etc.
	- *For example, when speaking to yourself, imagine you were speaking to a friend. What would you say to them?*
	- *Even if you go through this process and you don't find the magic words, at least what you're doing is **disrupting the autopilot** of the [[Fixed mindset]].*
		- *In the [[Fixed mindset]], one thought leads to another which leads to another, etc. If we can disrupt this, then your neurons become a little bit more malleable; less fixed; then you'll start to shift in the other direction.*
	- *Takes introspection. What tiny amount of wiggle room can you five yourself?*
		- *Ex: "Even though there's a 99% chance I'm going to fail next time, I have to admit to myself that it isn't 100%, right?"*
		- Don't bully the mind by forcing yourself to think positive thoughts that are bullshit. This has the opposite effect & will keep you stuck.
