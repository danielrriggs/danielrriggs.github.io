Mutually reinforcing set of activities, practices that catalyze specific steps of anagoge for a specific individual. Developed through trial, error, reflection and informed by cognitive science. 

A successful ecology of practices would allow for an individual to:

- recognize and correct for his or her own cognitive biases, including but not limited to:
	- [[Hyperbolic Discounting]]
	- Confirmation bias, the tendency to seek out and interpret information that confirms oneâ€™s own existing beliefs
	- Halo effect, the tendency for a person's positive or negative traits to "spill over" from one personality area to another in others' perceptions of them
	- Loss aversion, the tendency to prefer avoiding losses rather than  acquiring equivalent gains
- reduce modal confusion
	- Consumerism, advertising and market interests try to convince people (often with great success) to satiate being or developmental needs by buying things, which would be a solution to a having mode (physical needs) problem.
- cultivate healthy, sustainable and productive: mindfulness, habits and relationships
- Avoid addiction aka reciprocal narrowing
