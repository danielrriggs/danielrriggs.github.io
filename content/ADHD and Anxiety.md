[[Mood disorders]] such as [[Depression|Major Depressive Disorder]] are statistically way more likely than [[ADHD]] and [[Anxiety]], but clinically, most people are worried about [[ADHD]] & [[Anxiety]].

There's a 25 to 28% comorbidity between ADHD and anxiety. That means is that if you have [[ADHD]], there's actually about a one in three to one in four chance that you also have an [[Anxiety]] disorder & vice versa.

When we look at the comorbidity between [[ADHD and Depression]], we find a causative relationship. That is, having [[ADHD]] earlier in life can lead to depression as a teenager or adult. Is the same true of ADHD and anxiety?

There may be a subtype of [[ADHD]] that includes anxiety (emotional dysregulation). Sometimes people with [[ADD]] really struggle with things like impulsivity and getting angry quickly, but it also appears that there's some specific connections in the brain between [[ADD]] and the parts of our brain that experience fear and anxiety.
- Some of the first line treatments for ADHD (stimulant medications) can actually exacerbate anxiety (restlessness, fidgeting, insomnia).
	- Studies show that stimulant medications can actually improve anxiety by strengthening the [[Frontal lobes]] ability to suppress negative emotion. 

For a neurotypical brain, fear and benefit of an action get integrated together. A neurotypical brain relies on the [[Frontal lobes]] to suppress the action of the [[Amygdala]] & [[Limbic system]]. 
For people with [[ADHD]], the reward of a behavior doesn't get integrated into its fear. The [[Frontal lobes]] have reduced inhibitory capacity. Their ability to block impulses is lower. This is also true of people who have [[Anxiety]].

People with ADHD appear to be at times very fearless, yet there's also comorbidity between [[ADHD]] and [[Anxiety]]. How can someone be both fearless and anxious at the same time?

Here are two different flavors of [[ADHD]] and anxiety
- If you act more **impulsively and fearlessly**, you should slow down & think more about the cost of behaviors. Recruit a little bit of that fear or anxiety to help you integrate into making the right choice.
- On the flip side, if you find yourself being overly **controlled by anxiety**, chances are that's because your frontal lobes are not as good at suppressing your emotional circuitry.

###### Interventions
- [[Meditation]] has been shown to strengthen the frontal lobes. It doesn't matter what diagnoses you have or don't have.
- [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|CBT]] can entrain us to slow down & not engage in impulsive behavior.
- Stimulant medications.

If you have both [[ADHD]] and [[Anxiety]], the problems are related. Studies show that your problems aren't necessarily more difficult.
