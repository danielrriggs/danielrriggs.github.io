Limbo of eternal preparation. Why does our mind keep telling us we aren't ready?

What is the nature of readiness?
- *There's confidence, effortlessness, & positive emotional experiences associated with readiness*
- *There's shame and embarrassment and fear and anxiety associated with unreadiness*
Readiness is an antidote to uncertainty and failure. With this [[Samskara]], our mind is trying to keep us from struggling. It's trying to prevent us from fear, embarrassment, and potential failure. Readiness is a feeling, not a measurable thing.

This [[Samskara]] (like all [[Samskara]]s) is born of an emotional experience.

How to tell the difference between the [[Samskara]] of readiness & actually being ready:
- When you take a step forward (for example, when you do some homework / training), does the feeling of readiness actually increase?
If instead, when you do some preparation, your mind keeps telling you "you aren't ready yet", it's setting up a staircase that goes forever.

###### What do we do about this?
- First, notice these thoughts in your mind.
- Second, when you have these thoughts, what does it motivate you to do? To get more ready? Or to not bother trying?
	- In the case of actual preparation and readiness, usually an awareness that we have work to do should create some amount of [[motivation]]. But when this is a samskara, what it'll do is it'll either create some kind of fake activity, like it'll tell us, oh, we need to research it, and research it, and research it, instead of ever actually doing it. Or what it'll do is tank our motivation entirely. That's your clue that this isn't about actual preparation; it's about an emotional root.
- Third, we have to go back to where that feeling of emotional unreadiness comes from.
