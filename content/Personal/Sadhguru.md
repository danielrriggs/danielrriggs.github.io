Human Being - Soul, Mind, Body

Yoga - the science & technology which allows the human being to function at its highest possibility (to go beyond the limitations of the physical). To know life in its full potential. Transmitted, not taught. Transmitted as a live process.

Yoga - moving from a piece of creation to the creator. The creator (the manufacturer of the human being) is within. You ignore it through busyness. Living on the surface is living as a piece of creation.
Perception
Deeper understanding of life (not on the level of your mind).
"My mind, my body" > we call this Me. ("I am not the Body. I am not the Mind"). Yoga's like a GPS system trying to locate you - "Where are you?"

More exploration just brings more confusion. Trying to know existence from the outside. Turning inward takes you beyond sensory perception. If you know this piece of life, you know almost everything worth knowing. It's easy to know.
Wanting to know by dissection is the wrong approach. This is not how you get to know life.

Sense organs are outward bound.

Why body scans in bodybuilding is important.

When I eat a piece of food, how do I feel?
How fatigued am I? Do I feel soreness or tightness? Why? What's the cause of how I feel? Too much coffee? Why did I reach for the coffee? How was I feeling when I reached for the coffee? If I feel the impulse for coffee, bodybuilding can cause me to stop and say, "should I do this? There IS a cost to drinking coffee. It can interfere with nutrient absorption and stuff, but, more importantly. I can feel it in my veins. Idk what's happening with the adrenal glands or cortosol levels or whatever, but it FEELS acidic. I feel the buzz. The high. And the weakness it brings (depends how much you drink). I feel my body temperature increase. I feel my mood and focus start to take a shape. Oftentimes it's on the aggressive side. I feel the forehead & face harden. My breath becomes deeper and more conscious. My focus becomes heavy."

Neuroscience tells us that what we perceive through the 5 senses isn't actually what reality is.
Infrared glasses.
Electromagnetic field which the heart emits.
Waves in physics are very strange. Light behaves like a particle sometimes, and a wave other times.

Mastery over life energies.
Mastery over your mind - 50 - 60% of life destiny will be decided by you.
Other 40% - 

To be human - means, you can mold the situations as you want.
Most people react to the situations in which they're placed.
Why was I placed here? (My parents, place in world, etc.).
Everything you know as myself today is an accumulation of impressions.

The water doesn't long to go to the ocean. If you open the dam, it will flow just because of its tendencies.

Transformation (not change) is a rewiring of oneself. It can happen in 24 hours.

Destiny is in your hands.
> Learned that in bodybuilding. There is always great power in the hand. Always. Whether you're a master or a slave.

Mind & body is here to serve life. But right now your life & body is enslaved to you.

Karma - accumulated mass of experiences (like memory. It's the backup system for the software). Like a smell. What's in your head is how you smell. You'll attract 
Accumulated impressions is a software you wrote for yourself unconsciously.
Whatever yo do unconsciously, you can do consciously. If you start writing a conscious software, you will write on of blissfulness & liberation. Not of bondage & misery.

The still lake doesn't know what is peace. Peace is a concoction of disturbed minds. You don't have to do anything to be peaceful.

Question is a test. It is vain. Not interested in knowing tools. Only in testing your conclusions. You want to make a fool out of those you have asked. You are not interested in knowing about yourself. Not in your growth or transformation.
Karmic substance reverberates & multiplies.
Just do it. It will slowly transform. It's laborious.
The common wavelength was perseverance. Because they think they understand. Back then they knew they didn't understand.
