Factors
Grind Fineness
- Affects water flow through time (aka extraction time). Longer = more flavor. Finer = stronger. If it's too bitter, go coarser. Finer means more aroma (including bitterness).
	- Dark: Coarser is recommended; Light: Finer is recommended.
Water Temperature - doesn't affect coffee taste. Personal preference.
