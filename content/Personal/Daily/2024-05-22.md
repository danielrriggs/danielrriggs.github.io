# Log
Went to 1 yoga class on no food. Now I am tired, weak from hunger but no appetite. Coffee only. Makes it hard to study. Makes impulse stronger. I don't want to eat.

Noting this so I can avoid the negative energy balance in the future.

Negative energy factors - 
- Some, but limited momentum
- Poor sleep (little caffeine yesterday, started a little behind schedule?; wasn't fully fed or rested)
- Inadequately fed

- LeetCode failure resilience
- CoH as soothing alternative?

## Reflection
What's one thing that wasted your time?
Why are you excited about achieving your long term goal? What's that going to feel like?
What are you grateful for?
What did you accomplish?
What could have been done better?
What do I want (the result)?
### Meditation
