## Reflection
What's one thing that wasted your time?
- Missed a meal due to kitchen conflict. Missed Fred's class. Stayed up all night.
Why are you excited about achieving your long term goal? What's that going to feel like?
What are you grateful for?
What did you accomplish?
What could have been done better?
What do I want (the result)?
