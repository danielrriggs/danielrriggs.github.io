Created [[Organizational System Goals]]

Goals for my organizational system:

- Energy support
	- Prevent undereating
		- Make it easy to eat in the morning. Morning is when I don't like to eat.
	- Prevent overeating
		- Overeating mid day
			- I overeat when I:
				- Overtrain
					- The day before, I need to be remember how important it is to wake up early and eat a large breakfast. Eggs. Steak / protein. Carbs (chop potato prior day?). Butter. Cheese. Stuff I actually will cook & eat.
					- Reasons I overtrain:
						- To get a high ... dopamine?
						- Social contact
							- Ego? To feel desired.
				- Over work
					- What's the end goal?
					- Why am I over caffeinating?
			- Don't overtrain so much that you skip a post meal walk. Remember that it will benefit you.
		- Overeating at night
			- Remember what it will do to sleep. Visualize how miserable insomnia is.
			- Let go of attachment to hypertrophy.
	- Sleep on time
		- I have difficulty sleeping when I:
			- under work
			- Over caffeinate
