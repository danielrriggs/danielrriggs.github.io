Created [[Information Processing, Mindset, & Motivation]]

In cafe, strong ego from teenage girls.
"I am a dancer, so I know ... blah blah blah"
Reading bad definitions like "love is a strong feeling of affection"; not perceiving the problems with that.

The memetic rhetoric - it's all external. Reading stuff ... "sits on his throne in radiance" ... mapping that onto ("it's like one word = maximum power / force) - even the concepts are material in nature.

Materialist navigation tools. Navigating material. In the worldly realm.

Not recognizing that they lack understanding (subjective experience).
