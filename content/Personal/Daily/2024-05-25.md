todo:
- Add JBP's rules for life to concepts folder.
	- Left off - [(1) The Way of Walking Alone - Jordan Peterson (Best Motivational Speech) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZP8cxDwNL0)
- Read through those Go Super Brain transcripts and take notes
- Fix the Router situation
	- Sonic Boom has been dropping connection at night constantly for list 2 weeks. Device limitation. Don't think it's very strong. Lookup product specs.
	- Talk to dad about whatever's plugged in and try my router?? Extra hop might be slowing things down.


Find: Dan Dimartini - write things down that bring a tear to your eye (The Ether by Glasslands). Find where he said this.
Link what you're doing (behaviors) to your values.


Theme:
Ameliorate inhibition first, hit the gas pedal second.


Glockse reading of 123 @ ~ 4:00.
I ate a little this morning, had 2.5 coffees? Drank sugar during 2 yoga classes. Ate some pasties and might have had a protein shake. Think I drank a Macchiato at 3:00ish?

Blood pressure 116 / 50.

Mam log - phone call to take out the trash.
Stories of childhood powerlessness told to McWharters ... "I was so good at this, but they wouldn't let me."

## Reflection
What's one thing that wasted your time?
Why are you excited about achieving your long term goal? What's that going to feel like?
What are you grateful for?
- Being around good vibes during morning class. Mom's Pasties.
What did you accomplish?
What could have been done better?
- Food readiness. Get hearty food in you faster after training. I was going to eat a shake, but was saved by pasties, which is much better (shakes are super inflammatory).
What do I want (the result)?
### Meditation, Journal
###### Oura Ring Data Correlations
I looked at my Oura Ring data to see what does (and doesn't) correlates most strongly with HRV. It's average resting Heart Rate.

Observation: My average **bedtime** since 2021 is much later **than** I thought (past 1 AM). I think this is due to revenge bedtime procrastination, adhd, depression, not wanting to wake up tomorrow, low dopamine, inadequate social contact (quality of friendships), low control over environment and circumstances, low hope, anhedonia.
