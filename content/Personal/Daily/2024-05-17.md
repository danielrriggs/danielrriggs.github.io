# Log
Tony Robbins on goal setting -
Figure out what you want, set a standard, implement ritual. Ritual is what powers progress. Don't focus on action, focus on outcome.

"**Raise your standards**" > means, reframe should to musts? Duties. Resolve. Make a resolution. Resolve. Duty.

## Reflection
What's one thing that wasted your time?
Why are you excited about achieving your long term goal? What's that going to feel like?
What are you grateful for?
- Gym friends
What did you accomplish?
What do I want (the result. Think in terms of outcome.)?
