By Swami Rama

4 fountains responsible for emotion: food, sex, sleep, self preservation.

Pg 70. 
Atman - hub of a wheel (metaphor) - center of consciousness.
You identify with the spokes. They move and change.

4 different functions of the mind: 
Manas - sensory / motor mind. Thinking mind.
	 Sankalpa vikalpa - constant doubt from the Manas.
Ahamkara - ego. Separates you from the whole. Makes you petty & selfish.
Chitta - storehouse of all knowledge through which you receive knowledge. Merits & demerits. Power of becoming from within & knowledge from without. Intuitive library.
Buddhi - counselor within you. Discrimination. Judges. Decides.

Manas & Ahamkara are the lower faculties of mind.
Polishing the mind - lead the Ahamkara towards Chitta & train the Manas toward buddhi.

Tamas - lazines or intertia. Negative habits are formed when bad habits are repeated.

The number of minutes it takes to get out of bed is how lazy you are. If you remain intert in bed, you are wasting and energy, and at the same time you are forming a bad habit that affects you on both the physical and mental levels.
Lethargy & sloth - come from overeating, or eating foods that create lethargy. Also from not doing things on time, not forming habits which are helpful to you, or not having control over your appetites. Training the physical habits has a direct result in training the mind.

Vedanta philosophy - we are ultimately self-illumined.

Your habit patterns weave your personality.

Attention and memory come from interest. If you forget something, you never paid attention to it. If you forget something, why did you not pay attention to the things you should?

Whatever you do, learn to take a real interest in it. Doing things without interest weakens & dissipates the mind & creates internal conflict.

To develop the memory, learn to consciously relax for a few minutes each day. Sleep is an insufficient form of relaxation. The relaxation must be done consciously.

Exercise: sit in a comfortable & steady posture. Can use a chair if you're untrained & can't sit on the floor.
Steady posture - head, neck, & trunk are in a straight line.
Breathe diaphramatically (on exhale: ab muscles will come in & expel the spent gas. ab muscles assist the diaphram in expanding).
Count from 1 to 100. Count from 100 to 1. Note the mental distractions. Eventually you can extend this exercise up to 1000.
