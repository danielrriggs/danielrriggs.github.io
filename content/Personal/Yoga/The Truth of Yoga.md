vratya - Single men. Violence + sacred. Pent up energy - spewn on land. Thought to fertilize.
[[Brahmans]]
Veda - means knowledge
Vedas - brahman hymns (teachings)
Brahamanism - academic word for Hinduism.
Vedanta - last teachings of the Vedas. School of philosophy based on the Upanishads & similar ideas in the Bhagavad Gita & Brahma Sutra.
(example of non verbal knowledge):
Advaita - "not having two parts." or, "non-duality". Oneness encompassing everything.
Atman - innermost self. Identical to everything else in existence.

Aitareya Upanishad 

Embodied Liberation
Jivanmukti - Vedantic commentaries call this "emancipation (from desires) while being alive". It's how Brahman is attained in this world.
However, this term isn't in the Upanishads or the Mahabharata or the Yoga Sutra. In the Yoga Sutra, the liberated state is called kaivalya, or, "aloneness".
Liberation arises through insight.
- Bhagavad Gita (2.54) - one is "steady in wisdom" and able to act, not obliged to do nothing awaiting deliverance after death. "Renunciation and the yoga of action both lead to ultimate bliss,"the Gita teaches. "But of the two, the yoga of action is better than the renunciation of action" (Bhagavad Gita 5.2).
Purusha - conciseness
Prakriti - matter
Purusha - "person". All beings contain a purusha.
Samkhya - "counting". 24 constituent "principles" (or, tattvas).
- The great elements, the sense of ego, the intellect, matter in its non-manifest state, the eleven senses, and the five objects they perceive. (Gita 13.5)
- The elements are earth, water, fire, air, and space, from which all things evolve. The sensory apparatus includes mental faculties (along with the ego and intellect), in addition to sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell, plus physical instruments of action (the hands, feet, voice, anus, and genitals). Finally, the objects of the perception are visible form, sound , sensation, aroma, and flavor.
According to Samkhya philosophy, all objects are made of three gunas, or, "characteristics".
gunas - formless.
- Sattva - Radiance. Wholesome light. Also a distraction, though. Clarity.
- Rajas - Dynamism. Creative. Firey. Jittery. Material qualities of passion.
- Tamas - Dullness. Dark. Heavy. Grounding.
All objects have varying quantities of these 3 gunas.
There are six darshanas - "ways of seeing"
- The orthodox (those that do not dispute the authority of the Vedas) - astika.
- The heterodox (the ones that do, such as Buddhism) - nastika.

Pitanjali's Yoga darshana is based on Samkhya.

Yoga means **samadhi** - "absorption" in meditative states that end mental activity.

Kaivalya - a state of "aloneness" implying a withdrawing from material existence.
Patanjali's premise - life makes us suffer because of desire & misunderstanding.
// Confusion was the cause for reincarnation (I think).
He says we suffer through "turnings of thought", or chitta vritti.
The inclination to cling is one of five mental obstacles. Each of these kleshas ("torments") obstructs yogic practice.
Attachment (raga) & aversion (dvesha) are closely related.
The urge not to die - abhinivesha; which is sustained by mistaking the self for the voice in the head that declares itself "me" (asmita). All of these problems are driven by ignorance about our true nature (avidya). We tend to misidentify with what we perceive, instead of the consciousness perceiving it (2.3-9).
The states of mind produced by kleshas are eliminated by meditation, but the kleshas are more entrenched (2.11).
They are weakened by the "yoga of action" (kirya yoga), combining self-discipline, study, and devotion. These practical methods help to steady the mind to reach samadhi. The heated effort of tapas removes impurities, while svadhyaya - reading sacred texsts - addresses ignorance. The final component, ishvara pranidhana, is submission to divinity. As in the Bhagavad Gita, it can be understood as "abandonment of all hankering after the fruits of action," says the original commentary on sutra 2.1.
Kaivalya - absolute freedom of the seer (2.25).
Mental states are the basis of karma, containing traces of previous behavior that shape future action. These subliminal imprints have two forms - samskara and vasana.
- Vasanas - dormant potential.
- Samskara - active.
Samskaras are linked to samsara, the never-ending cycle of births and deaths. They store the impacts of actions, thoughts, and feelings on the mind, which fuels more activity, making more imprints. The mind's undisturbed flow occurs due to samskaras (Yoga Sutra 3.10).
The karmic chain can be broken by silence, allowing the emergence of "truth-bearing wisdom".
"When absorbed in meditation, one is not afflicted by the dualities of the opposites" (2.33-34). This can be applied to explore a middle way between extremes of emotion.
Another technique that helps to settle the mind is "the cultivation of friendship towards the happy, compassion towards the suffering, joy towards the virtuous, and indifference towards the nonvirtuous" (1.33).

[[niyama]]

[[Kriya Yoga]] Yoga
[[Raja Yoga|Ashtanga]] -  Begins with ethical guidelines of yana ana niyama, followed by posture (it bears no resemblance to modern stretching).
[[Eight Limbs of Raja Yoga]]
[[Asana]]

Patanjali's general approach is a balance of "practice and detachment," abhyasa and vairagya (1.12).
Abhyasa - the effort to be fixed in concentrating the mind [and] becoming firmly established when it has been cultivated uninterruptedly and with devotion over a prolonged period" (1.13-14).

Vairagya - "The controlled consciousness of one who is without craving for sense objects" (1.15).
The two work in tandem to steady the mind.

Once the body is settled and steady, the breath is controlled in pranayama, which helps to turn the senses inward (prattyahara). The final three elements form a progression from concentration (dharana) to meditation (dhyana) and absorption (samadhi). Each part of the system is known as an *anga*, meaning "limb". Together, they support the ultimate goal of yoga, defined as a state beyond the mind.
Samadhi - putting toegether the subject & object of perception.
Once the mind is steady, there are multiple levels of deeper focus. The first four have parallels to the Buddha's pre-awakening meditations: "Absorption with physical awareness, absorption with subtle awareness, absorption with bliss, and absorption with the sense of I-ness" (1.17).
/// left some detail out on pg 95; 96.
Pg 98 on entanglement. Focus on the qualities of heaviness, vitality, and brightness in all things.
Magic Powers
Signs of progress begin to appear as sustained concentration develops awareness. Observing the cycle of cause and effect leads to powers of prediction: "When samyama is performed on the three transformations [of characteristics, state, and condition], knowledge of the past and the future ensues" (Yoga Sutra 3.16).

pg 104 - become more harmonious with others vs leave the world behind.
Patanjali would say that using yoga to be more skilled in society keeps us entangled.
