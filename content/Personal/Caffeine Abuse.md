Medically speaking, this answer is spot on. A key criteria of addiction is that it interferes with normal life and has detrimental effects on you. Since caffeine is so freely and cheaply available these criteria are never met.

EDIT: For those asking, here are the criteria used for classifying "substance dependence" and "substance abuse" that is used by mental health professionals to assess what we call addiction. For those asking if rich people can never get addicted, that's not the case because there are still many "maladaptive" behaviors that they can demonstrate.

Substance dependence, or addiction, as defined by the DSM-IV, is indicated by the presence of three or more of the criteria listed below in the last 12 months. Note that all but the first two criteria reflect some form of loss of control over the use of or effects of the drug.

Tolerance: Does the patient tend to need more of the drug over time to get the same effect?

Withdrawal symptoms: Does the patient experience withdrawal symptoms when he or she does not use the drug?

Continued use of drug despite harm: Is the patient experiencing physical or psychological harm from the drug?

Loss of control: Does the patient take the drug in larger amounts, or for longer than planned?

Attempts to cut down: Has the patient made a conscious, but unsuccessful, effort to reduce his or her drug use?

Salience: Does the patient spend significant time obtaining or thinking about the drug, or recovering from its effects?

Reduced involvement: Has the patient given up or reduced his or her involvement in social, occupational or recreational activities due to the drug?

Substance abuse, as defined by the DSM-IV, involves a maladaptive pattern of substance use resulting in significant negative physical, social, interpersonal or legal consequences. Unlike substance dependence, the criteria for abuse do not include tolerance, withdrawal or a pattern of compulsive or uncontrolled use.
