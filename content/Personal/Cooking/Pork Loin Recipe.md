cut in half
cut such that piece is not 2 ??

water should be half the height of the meat.
saute buttons. put whatever season you want. brown all sides. 2-4 m per side. nice & brown. pull pork out. deglaze the pan. little water or stalk. 

Deglaze:
Use stock or water. You don't want more than 1/2 cm in the pan. just enough to cover the bottom.
 the rapid boiling will break that stuff of f the bottom of the pan.
	 This is how stocks are made. Take a spoon. scrape the bottom to break up stuff off the bottom. Now you have that flavor in the liquid. And, deglazing will keep it from buring. You can add spices. Thyme, red / white wine. At that point, it's a blank canvas.
	 Deglazing is important for 2 reasons: 1, you get the flavor, 2 you get 

Deglaze immediately.

Pork loin. Put in the pan. Add water or stock up to half of the loin in the pan (instant pot) 8 minutes for pressure cooker.

The way muscle works when it's cooked is that it's tightened. It forces the liquid out. If you slow cook it, you find those little moisture pieces to find in the meat in the strands.
	45m rare - allow the center to de-pressure allowing that moisture to stay in it. Ribeye act as a natural moisturizer. Turkey & chicken - no fat easy to be dry as hell. BBQ low & slow mentality for the center of it. Keep it moist.


45m. it'll be depressured. Pull meat out. Hit saute on instant pot. Bring liquid to boil. Make a sauce out of that dripping. You're essentially making an aju. Take the liquid that that meat cooked in. Plus it's got the seasonings from the deglazing. Plus it's got the seasonings from the meat.

Taste it. See if it needs more salt / pepper. Don't adjust it.
Because, when you reduce it, its flavors will be amplified. For example, if it needs more salt and you add more salt.
It should have good depth of flavor, but it can be bland.

1lb of pork will take x amount of salt & pepper; it's not worth being that preceise. we're baking, not cooking. we don't need to be precise. cooking; we aren't cutting 
	Unless you're measuring everything, it might not be worth measuring anything.


Reduce it down. (Cook out water). Taste it. Reduce it. Taste it. Etc. Flavor will get stronger. Viscosity will get thicker.

Then, we need to thicken. (Turn it from a broth to a sauce)
Easy way - add corn starch
Demi-glace (half-glaze) is super reduced stock.
Demi-glace is thickened with 
	You get gellatin naturally from the bones; that's why you want to use lots of knuckle bones, ...

Making it in big batches.

Grain Fed Steak - fattier taste
Grass Fed Steak - 

Reduce to half. Season to taste. Cut a chunk of meat into bite size pieces. Ladel broth over the top. Eat as is. Or, you can make a sauze.

Easy way - add 1 tbsp of corn starch. You can't add corn starch to a hot product or it'll clump up (it's heat activated).
Take a small bowl. Add a few tbsp of water. Little mor than that. Maybe half a cup of water. Add a tbsp cornstarch. Use a wisk to wisk it together. Cold water. It's gotta be cold water. Then, once it's cloudy water. Go back to your bowl of liquid and pour it into your liquid while wisking.

Traditional way - make a Rue. A traditionally thickening process. You need a second pan. More steps & you need a second pan.
Take some oil, or butter. Traditionally you would use butter. Clarified butter, actually. If you use regular butter, the milk solids will scorch.
	Clarified butter - butter you've melted & separated the milk solids out of, leaving only the liquid fat.
		That would be a further adendum.
	Heat it up so it's hot. Add flower to the butter. 
		Stir it together. It should have the consistency of wet sand. When you're at the beach and you have sand such that it won't hold its for. You can stir it and it'll hold its form for a second then collapses. Very wet sand.
	Why you're doing it that way - you're using the flower to thicken the liquid. 
		Raw flower tastes terrible. Technically, you're deep frying or sauteeing the flower, depending on how you think about it. By cooking the flower, it's no different than making toast. Eat a raw piece of bread. Fine. Toast. More flavor. If you add raw flower to your liquid, it wouldn't taste good. That's how you make dumplings. It would be doughy, bland. So, you cook the flower through the butter or oil and.
			Technially 3 types of rue
			white, blonde, brown. Only difference is how long you cook it.
			If you're making a cream sauce (a bachumenl) a white gravy, you would use a white a rue. ?? ... ??. Brown rue like gumbo.
			It'll start off white and get darker as you cook it.
			Darker will have a bit more flavor.

Let the Rue thicken (cool down and jellify - it's like a )

Turkey Gravy is Rue and Turkey Stock.

Nappe - wood spoon. lift horizontally. the sauce should coat the spoon. that's how you know you have the sauce properly thickened.
