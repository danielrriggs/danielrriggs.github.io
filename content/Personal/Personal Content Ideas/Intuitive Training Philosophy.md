Analogy: Tai-Chi vs Kung-fu (Wu-shu) vs Karate vs Hopkido philosophies.

The difference is that my training has no purpose. I follow bodybuilding kind of protocols sort of, but I'm not attempting to employ  HIIT / Mike Mentzer style philosophies, which are concerned with minimizing systemic fatigue in order to maximize hypertrophy.

This doesn't mean I'm not going to limit my systemic fatigue. It's just that I do so because If I don't, it will put me out of balance & I will have brain fog, insomnia, low appetite, etc. My aim isn't necessarily to maximize hypertrophy.

One key difference is how much time I spend on higher loads. I spend much much more time on lower loads, and then pyramid up a bit and do lowish volume on higher loads. I like the experience of high volume training. I believe that this method is likely to be sub-optimal for maximizing hypertrophy.

Find a rhythm. Don't overtrain. Don't undertrain.
