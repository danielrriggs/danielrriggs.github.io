You Must Be The Master of Your Own Kingdom

Inspiration: [[You Must Be The Master of Your Own Kingdom]]
On this idea of being interested in a narrative's body as opposed to its' soul.
The essence of a story vs its facts.

"Religion has done to the spiritual significance of narrative what the businessman did to the suit. He's literalized it. He's doing it for others (for convention), not realizing that wearing a suit is something spectacular. He isn't doing it for himself." By literalizing narrative (by seeing only a narrative's exterior aspects), we see the world upside down & aren't interested in the essence of the narrative (that is, interested in the narrative's body as opposed to its soul).
