Seeing the self & the relationship with the divine.

Don't get stuck on anything (religion, self help, or anything). Also, Don't be a junkie. When you find something that works for you, commit to assimilating it.
Watch fewer youtube videos & do more practice. The gym isn't a wholistic.
The mind gets addicted to information and knowledge. It can't assimilate & integrate it.


Think the gym can take you places & in a way that other places can't; but, I'm realizing that it's a very rare person that is able to tap into that stuff and go to those places.
Like, some of the most receptive people to feedback were engineers with no ego - able to feel & see clearly. Looks like natural talent. Ahmed; poor; from Tunisia. Takes some people months to learn some of the ABCs - eliminating mechanical advantage, not using momentum.
Psychologically, engaging aggression - obviously a huge spectrum. Seep in aggressive music for years - big difference between rock music and rap, for example.

The psychology of Free climber - Alex xyz - someone who's like on the verge of suicide; the gym can be a baston for development (if you're running on ego, you aren't going to have the pure force of desperation behind you). Desperation isn't necessity. It isn't necessary for Alex to be doing his free climbing, but I bet if you talked to him, he would say like, I have to do it.

Not trying to speculate on why it's there or to render judgments toward it, I'm trying to first just observe it - point it out - basically saying, I see a resonance between the gym and that culture.

As a result, like, the messages people profess from their physical practices, I don't resonate with:
I don't resonate with the idea that the gym is a place to
- Be disciplined - implies some kind of resistance to overcome. Very strongly disagree. It's the other way around. If I'm forced to deviate from my diet & don't have access to a gym because I have to travel or something, that's when I feel the worst & start falling apart. My routines are necessary in order to maintain my current mental - physical homeostasis. Might be some level of attachment, but it's not the same kind of attachment that comes with things like drugs (caffeine, THC, alcohol, corn) - I bet the neuroscience & psychology of so called "extreme" physical practices are probably largely unexplored and likely widely misunderstood.
- Work hard - I strongly disagree that the gym is hard work. Very strongly disagree. I wouldn't describe the activity as easy, and I see that some people seem to not be cut out for it, but I think the word *hard* is not right. Implies painful, or unpleasant. There's like a way to transmute that stuff into pleasure - even to an extreme where it becomes obsessive and compulsive.

It's a drug experience up there with the drug of a deep relationship, divine union, & plant medicine.
I don't know that career or fulfilling your duties can take you here.
