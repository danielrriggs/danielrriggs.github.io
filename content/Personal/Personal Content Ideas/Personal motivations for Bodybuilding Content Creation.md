2) Helps me write. Writing an outline helps me organize myself, shapes my perspective, find where information & domains intersect, & integrate my subjective (personal) experiences.
	1) I think I can come at my throat chakra from both the top and the bottom. I've been leaving out coming at it from the top-down (thinking); I have been approaching my problems as mostly physical (bottom-up). Writing & preparing these is helping me to find my voice.
3) Introduces opportunity for more frequent pattern interruption - Need to do something different.
	1) The feeling in the body when writing (&, connecting ideas) is different than consuming (watching a YouTube video, which is different from reading).
4) Experimental form of meditation (writing, Obsidian documentation, learning) - different feeling in the body than other forms of meditation (mindfulness, moving, mantra, Yoga Nidra / NSDR, guided, focused, etc.)

Observance: old memories sometimes crop up - ex: a song I haven't thought about in years. Etc.
