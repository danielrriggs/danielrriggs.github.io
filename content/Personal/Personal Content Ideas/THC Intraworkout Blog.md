What I've learned from THC + Gym.

Document physical observances.

What's happening? How do you feel? Can you integrate this back into sober state?

How to integrate altered states of consciousness?

I think this is a [[Samadhi]] experience.

But, I think it applies to the dimension of your context. For example, you will transform, but, the transformations will be within certain aspects or dimensions of you and not others. I think this is the value of pursuing another path instead of just one. The experience from other paths is different.

And then, maybe integration (or something like that) itself is even it's own path. Is this the contemplative??
Writing in obsidian is helping me connect ideas.

Perhaps there's an intuitive limb, and a conscious limb.
