Hotkeys to create a new note Ctrl + o (instead of ctrl + n) so you can see if you have something created like that already.

Style
In Obsidian, is there a back button to go back to the previously clicked block?
Bi-directional block links
	At the top of the program, have a breadcrumb with previous page (resource) & current.
		Keep a stack of resources. Whenever opening a resource, push it onto the stack.

Idea:
Online collaborative Obsidian.
	Github repo
Different operating models:
	- Master (1 guy who owns it, but allows others to make PRs). Primarily intended to be consumed.
	- [[Community]] [[governance]] models - ??

Ideal:
- Edited online
- Realtime editing & publishing
- Changelog(s)?

Good enough
- Github repo
- Where will it be published?
	- How to auto pull to publish

- What about cross cutting projects?
	- How can I control some of my own 
		- Vault within a vault?
	- Critique: Won't that just turn into wikipedia?
		- Levels of interpretation
			- Individual
			- Group
			- Global (like wikipedia)
		- How does the platform filter or change things?
			- Differing aim (objectives, deliverables, purpose(s))
			- Different levels of Tolerances wrt what's -holy-? Acceptable; sins; etc.

We live in a world that lacks [[Epistimological]] confidence.
	Related: Epistemicly weak. Epistemic confusion.
		What do you mean by weak?
			Related: power.
	Unrelated - how can i link derivations of the same concept - ex epistemic. epistemically; epistemology; epistimological. White list Related:?
		Do I have to manually catch these in an index?
	Downstream discussions - lack yield #
What I'll need for multiple people to use Obsidian - 
	- Style guide
	- Methodology
What does it mean to be epistemically weak?
		

Obsidian as a Service.

What's the purpose of:
	Publishing an Obsidian Vault
		- Sharing information
		- Building a brand
		- Offering value in order to trade *information*. Trade, exchange, connect, synthesize, use, have, 
	A collaborative Obsidian Vault
		- Receive information

It could be:
- To do your work
- To feel good
- To fulfil your purpose
- To increase oneself
- To increase some cause or idea


What is a relation composed of?


Mode of exploring an idea - 
- Start with a concept, like, 'what's the purpose of publishing an obsidian vault'?
	- That heads towads, 'what's the meaning of life?'
	- As we head that way, can we backtrack back to our starting point, or circumnavigate, in order to produce tilts or modifications?

This is like the S Town guy; or maybe like the image of Mike.

Better to sacrifice consciously & then work 100%.


Ideas to explore:
from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLp0ElEl0k0
Visual PKM
	Our tools shape us. Our traceability tools suck. Things that suck: working too much?? Real problem - lacking autonomy, a proven key motivator.
Host Online Idea Exchanges.
	The Obsidian tool needs to be ready to go and highly accessible.
Structural capital ??
Time crafting


The Ideaverse
Sensemaking vs meaningmaking


Structure: The Research Roundtable

Rebasing obsidian?? sounds complicated.


Single vs multiple vaults
Single brain = single vault.
But separate folders for broad areas. Ex: Evergreens are in the root, daily notes in their own folder, source/lit notes in their own folder, work-related project notes in their own folder, etc.

What about work - life segmentation?? Is that all one?


What about Hotkeys?

Some problems with Obsidian:
https://forum.obsidian.md/t/option-to-create-a-new-note-in-the-current-directory/153/4
I want to be able to create a new note in my current directory.
OR: If I could Paginate the side drawer, that'd be nice.
