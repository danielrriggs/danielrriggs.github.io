Ch 1 - Meaning vs Matter
Ch 2 - Copernican Revolution (sun @ center of solar system)
"Meta Cognitive" - a model of mind is not defined.

Copernican revolution - earth @ center implies that our focus is on earth as the more important thing over the technically accurate fact that the sun is.

"A naive perspective provided humans with a full understanding of their role in the universe and the spiritual purpose of existence." - ???

What's wrong with just saying, "If you rebel against God, you'll end up wandering in Exile." Idk how that works but I believe that it does.

Divine knowledge - ??

Genesis 1 & the Copernican revolutions are microcosms of materialism?

Ch 3 - Telescopes and microscopes warped our perspective. Take a tree centric view.

Ch 4 - Earth = lower half. Heaven = upper spiritual half.
Cosmic categories - Heaven, earth, time, space.

"water means fluid".

// Tai Chi - rising movements are fire; falling movements are water.
// todo - elemental references in MA's meditations.
 
 Ch 5 - earth !== matter; heaven !== energy
Heaven = spiritual meaning.

Materialism's fundamental duality is matter & energy.
// cult of quantum physics

Knowledge - ???

Ch 6 - language = interaction between corporeal (marks) & spiritual (infused with meaning).

// Turing test; limits of computation (simulation); 
LLMs; Transformer Architecture; high dimensional vector space.
The meaning (or reasoning) from LLMs (or AIs, Alistar) is emergent - emerges from their networks.
Fitness functions trained over generations.

Experience vs Knowledge.
We don't think of language as a storage medium because we're so immersed within it, and we think in words. But the whole of human experience is encoded into language.

LLMs don't encode or decode anything.
It doesn't have any of the human experiences that make words meaningful to us. It doesn't make meaning, but it doesn't have to.
Sees how the language shifts and flows, how it orders and rearranges its symbols in a very specific way to create coherent word-chains out of incoherent word-pools.

They can take new information and expand its context.

Ch 7 - Everything in the universe is analogous to a written word in a divine language.
Fact & meaning coexist.

Microcosm - representation of cosmic pattern.
Microcosm vs symbol vs metaphor.
"signs".
