Top of dominance hierarchy: acceptance/transcendence of suffering.

Rooted in Biology and culture.

"Morality is some second order cognitive problem"

Instantiation in your nervous system: you have a counter in your brain that keeps track of your status and it regulates the sensitivity of your emotions. If you're at the bottom, everything overwhelms. Any more threat and you're sunk. You have no extra resources. You become very sensitive to negative emotion and maybe also impulsive so that you grab when the grabbing's good. If you're near the top in the dominance hierarchy and counter tells you that then your serotonin levels go up, you're less sensitive to negative emotions… you're oriented to the medium and long term future.

Yung believed that.

Humans are watching the dominance hierarchy:

What are we up to?

What constitutes acceptable power? What constitutes acceptable sovereignty?

Who should lead? Who should rule? What should be at the top?

The Mesopotanians figured that out: Speech and vision and the willingness to confront the unknown. That's Marduk. That's what should rule.

What would you want to be king of the world of king of your soul? What do you want to subordinate yourself to? How about your heroic willingness to encounter the unknown and articulate it and share that with people. To the degree that you do that, you will be successful (assuming your society isn't entirely corrupt). You will be selected by men, selected by women. You'll be admirable…valued.

Watch the people you admire and figure out what's common across them. Draw your own conclusions. When you're being tortured by your conscience because you aren't doing what you should be and you know it, what is it that you're torturing yourself in relationship to? You have a vision of your own ideal and you torment yourself if you aren't matching it. What's the ideal? Well, you don't know. It's kind of incoherent and poorly articulated but that doesn't mean it isn't trying to manifest itself and make itself known to you. That's the purpose of religious education - to make the ideal articulated.

Orient yourself towards something. What goal would justify the suffering of your life?

Clean up your room.

Schedule your time.

Stop saying things you know to be falsehood. That violate your conscience. That make you feel weak.


Intelligence.

In large part, it's speed.

Stress tolerance (neuroticism)

Contentiousness.

Creativity

Agreeableness (competitiveness)

Jobs at the top of dominance hierarchy require high levels of intelligence and insane levels of contentiousness as well as high levels of stress tolerance.

As you move down the hierarchy, jobs get simpler or they're repetitive.

IQ predicts to some degree how rapidly you learn something, but once you've learned it, it doesn't predict how well you'll do at it.
