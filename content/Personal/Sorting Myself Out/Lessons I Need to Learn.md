- Drinking milk + whey protein wrecks my concentration. Idk why, but stop doing it. Any protein shake creates massive inflammation. It is not worth it. Don't do it. Eat real food. Drink some oj if lazy.

- Undereating
	- Morning is when I don't like to eat.
	- Because I want to overwork (work more in fasted state)
- Overeating
	- I overeat mid day to compensate for undereating.
	- I overeat at night
		- It wrecks my sleep
			- *Visualize how miserable insomnia is*
			- *Let go of attachment to hypertrophy*
	- I overeat when I overtrain
- Overtrain
	- I overtrain to get high
	- Ego? To feel desired?
	- *Question: When do I overtrain?*
- Sleep on time
	- Under Working
	- Over caffeinating
		- *Let go of evening workout high performance*
- Semen Retention
	- Impulses seem to be strongest from like 11am - 1:30pm or so. Same time focus is hardest.
	- Impulses are very strong when doing the hardest things - leetcode (hardest), reading (hard).
		- *Prepare your expectations ahead of time. Allocate time budget for [[Urge Surfing]].*
			- *Visualize the future gain (instead of resisting w/ willpower)*
- Sleep Aids - the downsides are worse than the upsides. I think I need to quit them for life & address insomnia root causes.
