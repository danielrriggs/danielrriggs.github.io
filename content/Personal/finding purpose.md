Finding your people (tribe).
1) People don't think about it
We used to live in a world of give & take. If I give advice for free, people would speak well of me. This doesn't work if you do what you're told working in a call center.
Don't ask "what do you want to do when you grow up?" Wrong question. Ask, "what problem do you want to solve?"
2) What problems matters to you? It could be small, like, the gym isn't open at the hours you want to go. If you start thinking about problems that bother you, your mind wakes up and starts thinking about other things. If you start thinking about what problems there are which you can solve, it will help you find purpose.
3) Matching what you do in your day & what your purpose is. This could be easy. You need to truly know yourself. Find your purpose.
4) Don't go at it alone. 1+1 = 11.
