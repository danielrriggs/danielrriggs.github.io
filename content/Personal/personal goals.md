#### Self-Reflection Exercise
Dissect out the intent of your goal in the Desire / Value / Should / Duty chart below to determine where your motivations for this goal lie.

```mermaid

quadrantChart
    title 4 Dimensional Intent Model
    x-axis Worldly --> Internal
    y-axis Costs --> Gains
    quadrant-1 Values 'Care About'
    quadrant-2 Desires 'Wants'
    quadrant-3 Shoulds
    quadrant-4 Duty 'Dharma'
```

**How can you reframe your motivations so that it aligns with the right column?**
*Example: For a goal of getting a job, we can shift the motivation of "wanting prestige among peers" or "should get a job be cause your parents expect it of you" to focusing on values of self-independence.*
