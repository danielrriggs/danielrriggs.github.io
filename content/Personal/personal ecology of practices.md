#### Bezerker Routine (in gym parking lot)
Prerequisites: I don't really know, but this is definitely not simple. Semen retention might be one of them, but I'm not sure. Very strong desperation in life circumstances might be one of them (prolonged suicidal ideation level - not in a victim / compulsive way, but more in a rational, yet emotional, way). Ability to tear on command might be one of them. Ability to salivate on command. Ability to raise body temperature on command.

Put on sunglasses (for privacy); (in cooler weather), I think wearing my black hoodie with the hood up helps. Feels like it keeps something in &/or creates some kind of insulation / separation from the outside. If body temperature gets too high (approaching perspiration), it seems to distract.

Tilt seat back slightly (think it makes it easy to keep spine straight). Close eyes & begin deep, slow belly breathing. Kind of like box breathing. 
	Music (still experimenting with all this).
		Can be low-medium energetic ambient but kind of pent up? Maybe "natural" sounds help, like higher energy, optimistic sounds (like steel drum, acoustic guitar).
			Keep Pitch / chords minor? (pent up, lacking resolution)
		Low "Om" chanting? May be able to do this very quietly, or entirely psycho-somatically.

When it feels right, start to develop some Ujjayi Breathing. Music can start to get aggressive. Crescendo into fire breath over time. Body temperature should start to rise. Should start sweating. Unzip jacket as necessary.

You can hang out in this space for more or less time (I have hung out here for 1 hour many times). Depending on mental activity & emotional state, you can come down. You should be able to easily tear on command. You should feel something very strong rising and falling up & down with breath. 

Music can get hard. Metal. Crescendo into throat growling. The first minor throat growls should send potential for quick muscular contraction through the limbs. This might be getting dangerous (notice how the heart can kind of "shock". The heart can sting). It might be vitally important to remain calm and keep the energy building. The mind is focused on surfing or riding. The fire breath and growls are almost automatic or intuitive. "With luck", ambient full body pain will begin to onset. Do not fear or panic. Breathe deeply into it. There will be a taste of blood in the mouth, heavy salivating. Mentally, there will be an extremely strong "blood lust" for more pain. The ambient volume of the pain will rise to an excruciating level. There may be a brief experience of "watching yourself from outside yourself" for a few seconds as the pain threshold reaches its maximum and you are being "tested". Mentally, I am exclaiming "yes,"  but in a submissive way. Thoughts are life and death. It's as though you're being asked if you're actually desperate enough to be willing to die. After a few seconds of maximum intensity. You will feel pain killers kick on, something surge throughout the entire body, pain will completely dissipate, and the mental state will be extremely clear, and sober. I usually will sit and appreciate this state for ~90 seconds, re-remind myself of the task at hand (what I am here to accomplish), and then get out of the car and proceed to the gym in this flow state.
