A brand is a statement about what you are doing. You want people to look at it and know what you're about. Nike's about supporting athletes. Apple's about supporting creatives. Branding's about the purpose of the business, not the design of the logo.

You have a personal brand, whether you want one or not. When you're not in the room, people talk about you. Being able to influence how others perceive you can change the course of your life.
	*Personal brand isn't everything. Personal brand isn't very scalable (with few exceptions, like the Kardashians). It can be a pain to maintain & create. It's dangerous if that's all you build.*

Start by writing down your:
Values - what do you care about? [[Dan Demartini]]
Non-negotiables - what will you say yes / no to?

To make your brand values clear, you do it by 1 of these 2 methods:
**Reference** - like Nike sponsoring an athlete.
	Risks: Someone can do something bad, but they usually get fired quickly. Ex: Kanye West getting dropped from Adidas.
**Leadership model** (ambassadors) - things that represent the brand.
	Risks: Apple put so much stock in the Steve Jobs brand that when he left, the magic left. You need to make sure that you as a leader leading that brand is sustainable.

Learn to say "No" - if you have a bad feeling that someone could threaten your brand, say "No". Brand is your most valuable asset. Build a brand, not a business.
