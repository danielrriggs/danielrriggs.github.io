Keep a spreadsheet with:

- The company name
- The date you applied
- How much you like the company (scale of 1-4, use conditional formatting to colour-code)
- The stage you are at (Applied/Phone Hello/Phone Tech/On Site/Offered)

If a company rejects you, move them to a separate list. You need to be able to see at a glance how many live applications you have and how many of them are actually interesting to you. Anything not on the above list is unnecessary and won’t get updated, so will just make your spreadsheet stale and less communicative.

2.4 Where to look

- [Hacker News Who’s Hiring thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7324236) - created on the 1st of every month, this thread provides a place for companies that read Hacker News to post job adverts. There are a lot of posts, and the companies are generally pretty interesting. I made 7 applications after seeing them on January 2014’s HNWH.
- [AngelList](https://angel.co/) - setting your profile to “I’m looking” gives you an idea of what it must be like to be an attractive girl on an online dating site, except with about half as much aggressive sexual abuse. It seems particularly fruitful if you are looking for seed-stage companies. I received 46 “X is interested in you”s and 4 developed into conversations.
- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/) - mostly spammy recruiters, some thoughtful recruiters, a small number of in-house recruiters. I received 16 messages. 1 developed into a conversation. Pro-tip: set your location to San Francisco (or wherever you are looking), even before you get there.
- [Hired.com](https://hired.com/) - this seems like a very interesting model, particularly for engineers. I was on auction for a week and received 8 credible-looking offers with actual proposed dollar amounts. None of the products felt like a fit for me, but the process was very easy and potentially disproportionately rewarding. In the worst case you still get some idea of your market value, although I would suggest only using your shot on it once you are in a position to actually follow up with any interesting offers.

- Intros/direct applications - these will still likely make up the bulk of the top of your funnel. I made 10 applications this way.

3.2 Standard general questions

You will inevitably gradually evolve your answers to the standard questions:

- Tell me about yourself.
- What are you looking for in your next:

- Product?
- Team? (size, culture etc)
- Technical challenge?

- Have you had experience scaling applications?
- Tell me about a cool project you worked on recently (very important).
