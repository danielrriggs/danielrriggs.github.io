Pitch:
What's the most important knowledge you have in life? What's the most important subject?
- No vague ethereal answers allowed (like God; brahman; wu wei; moksha or samadhi;). I mean in the corpreal realm.

I remember when I got my first paycheck, going to a coffee shop, and realizing - i had a hell of a time paying for college, and working in college, I never took the time to ask, where was I going with this? It was more like, I spent 100% of my focus on performing; like I cut out all fun to get an advantage in school. I had signed & actually honored these contracts - I didn't touch alcohol; had no sex; tried to keep my porn use to a minimum. I had never touched weed or any other drug. I did drink tons of coffee; still do. I bought a $4,000 coffee machine. I love coffee. I sit down, and google "how to invest". Day 1 - read the bogleheads getting started stuff. Learn about efficient market theory. Learn the simple compounding math, and I realize right away, the lifetime return of 6% compound ROR vs 8% RoR is like, millions of dollars. A small difference, compounded over a lifetime, is like, worth more than my entire career will probably earn me. On day 1 of getting a paycheck, I realized financial knowledge was important. I didn't like it, but realized that it was something that I was responsible for teaching myself.


Lookup lifecycle investing, or educate yourself on leveraged risk parody; wealth is made through leverage, and leverage is how you diversify across time. Add risk parody on top of this, and you will make lots of $. And I did make lots of $. I bet heavily against covid - for obvious reasons - when the s&p dropped 33% I remember thinking, this has got to be the single largest money making opportunity of all time. With every basis point it dropped the more I celebrated. Long story short, I did really well; I should have done 3x better. And could have done easily 10 - 100x better. I did plenty well. Wanted to make a little more $, then I kind of blew up, and for the first time in financial history, risk parody didn't work. Bonds an stocks fell together, really hard, for a really long time; basically because governments fucked up the financial markets in ways history hadn't seen, which I kind of knew would happen, I was just hoping to hit my goals because I really hated my career. Like, suicidal level - I remember going to vegas for $23 round trip ticket and having this experience of how insane this world is. First of all, the psychological conformity going from Texas to California when I was already a contrarian on covid. The riots.
The majority of my bloodline died of black lung in coal mines. They were dying all dying in their 20's & 30's. Like almost everyone on my ancestry charts. Talked to this w/ my grandma.
Anyway ... what a world we live in, where you have the freedom to take your entire life savings and just put it ALL on the Line on one roulette spin. And the casino will be happy to let you do it. They don't have balconies so people don't kill themselves, but like, I literally just walked onto the roof of .. I think it was the flamingo. I could have just jumped off if I wanted. So, idk about this no balcony thing. Anyway, before offing yourself, you might as well fly to vegas and have your 1 last shot, first, you know? There's something that's off about that place. It can be fun; the buildings are kind of remarkable. There's lots of glitz and like, it's cool on one layer. But there's another level that you can sense, like, this place is sick. You can sense the sickness. It's like going to new york. Every time I drive 1 hour outside of the city, like clockwork, the tension in my forehead completely dissolves. And then it comes back. It feels like a metal plate in my forehead. I've talked to people about this. **Everyone** has to adapt to living in NY. A lot of the people I talked to said it took them several year. I can't quite remember, but I think like 3 or something. The ambient stimulation is super extreme.


It's possible that **understanding the body** is the most important subject in your entire life. This is not **knowing about** the body. [[Vidya|knowledge]] vs [[Jnana|understand]]. For 10 years, I never formally studied anatomy. I did it all through feel.
- Now, the principles of high intensity exercise, like what Mike Mentzer pioneered - I violated consciously, because I wasn't optimizing for external results, and I knew it. I knew I had a compulsive relationship, but I got lost in my own experience there. The gym & my friend that passed away were like I think the only sources of positive emotion. I had a good relationship once for 5 years, but, that was never fully something I could rely on, and I think I knew it; But, I hated my career. Some jobs were worse than others. A few of them were okay. Working 20 hours was great. But works was always a fight. Every single day was a caffeinated fight to justify my existence. Mentally calculating my appearances; thinking about whether I could accomplish enough. Organizing my entire life like a maniac to maximize my work performance. I don't even want to think about it. I could easily write a book on this topic, but I don't even want to think about it. I hate discussing the things I've learned. I want to spend whatever amount of time & energy that I have left on solutions. I want my attention to be guided by beauty. I was never a truth first guy. My hermeneutic was always led by beauty. There was always a feeling of purity in my private workouts. I liked to stay private about it. It was as though if I talked about it or showed it off, it would corrupt it or diminish it in some way. I can tear just thinking about it. My heart rate and body temperature can rise just thinking about it. I can turn on my aggression and my bodies painkillers by just thinking about it. My psychology gets life and death like *really* quickly. I'm really protective of it. Like, there's a clip of kai greene - "If I gotta die in the gym, this is where I wanna be." I resonate with that so strongly. I'm like an addict, like, despite negative consequences - insomnia from overtraining, whatever else; ignoring my phone. I gotta get to the gym at all costs. My relationship with the gym has gone through a few phases; it hasn't always been perfect. I think at all points in my life, it has been the most important thing in my life, in a sense, and I don't have any regrets about the past, but I am older now and have learned a lot and am still continuing to learn things. The things I'm learning now are harder and way more complicated, but I am more balanced and more able to handle them, now. Ultimately, the product that my relationship produced was a bastion on resilience for all other dimensions of my life falling out - relationship, $, reputation, failures; my body probably was always there for me; even when it broke mysteriously; my mind is ... so strongly seared. It's a double edged sword. My internal dialogue for a long time was along the lines of "fuck your feelings ... nobody cares if you're sad; the world doesn't care that you're sad. You just have to function and be sad." My experiences in my early 20s kind of taught me that noone cared about me and to keep to myself. Working 80 hour weeks on the beach with my sister, living in the car; there was this one time I passed out with pain in my left arm; I thought I was having a heart attack. They sent me "home"; I insisted that I was fine. I remember being so angry and sad at the same time. I was so desperate. All of my food I stole from the plates. I remember I would buy blueberry bagels and pop tarts from publix for like emergency calories. I remember that I had only one day off in the entire summer; despite being exhausted, I ran 23 miles (w/ a small break) no training or anything. Hadn't run at all in months. I'd cramp up and chafe & did some walking on the way back; but I remember my time was still really good, like 5:40:00 or something. I remember going to shades (this bar) and being treated like a person. I couldn't have done any of that without my sister.


I learned in [[Action Success Calculation]] that physical confidence connects to other activities.


Having more energy > you want to be rich? you want to look good? You want to be effective towards some missions? Do you just want to study? Whatever you care about, it's important.


Esteem comes from within, not from without (you might forget all the positive things people say about you).


The first thing you should do to change your mind is change your body. Your physiology affects your emotion.
Then, you can ask yourself, what am I focusing on? Where am I? Where's my attention? Then you can ask, how do I feel?
You want to look for meanings in your feelings. Because meaning comes from beliefs. The meanings you assign to things creates emotion.
The internal dialogue you use is important.
That gets trained during in extreme conditions. I don't think it's necessary to regularly tap into extreme conditions. You can if you want to. But, it's good to have a few really hard formative events that you probably don't want to repeat in hindsight. For awhile I used to look at soccer conditioning that way. At this point I can run sprints for 90 minutes. But that level of tolerance probably took like 10 years.
5+ times I've thrown up on command with people under the squat rack. They were all when I was in early 20s. Feeling the nausea coming on. mouth waters. Your hair might stand up. Maybe you get a little cold. Nausea in the belly. Slight balance disorientation. Eyes feel heavy. You want to move slowly.

Robbins model: Body, focus, language (triangle). You need a compelling future. Under the triangle is identity.


Viktor Frankol - man's search for meaning - on guards


Goggins - who's gonna carry the boats?


You experience the life you focus on. Focus is controlled by beliefs and values. RAS - when I walk into the parking lot driving a Honda civic, I see way different cars in the parking lot than when I drive a different car.


All of the physicality modalities produce to me profoundly different emotional effects. I don't know how to explain it or what all the variables are.
Cold showers are pretty good;
Weights are by far the best imo.
Running.


What's important? Consistency.
On performance - proper preparation prevents poor performance.


You can't separate the mind and the body. Closing your eyes, you can produce fear (sympathetic affect) or a parasympathetic affect.


Body first philosophy. Isn't just biochemical. It's how you move (grace), how you breathe.


The physicality crisis >


Power postures (superman, or laying with hands above head). Todo: ask Anna about Tai Chi movements.


I don't like airport escalators.


Low energy from bad food.


Robbins:
Different decisions > different actions > different results


Themes - get yourself in order
Vanity?

You aren't your body.



Cartesian dualism (matter & mind) - is an error.
I think therefore I am. I can't be skeptical without saying the word I.
But, not materialism. (Turing test).
Refutation: computers only manipulate syntax, not meaning.
- Work out will immediately refute. There is a limited range of emotions that you can have while working out. When you work out, your emotions will move towards a certain spectrum. The mopey laying in your bed in a dark room at 11am or whatever low energy states get expunged. It could be sometimes that your body is shot, you go to the gym and you're just super weak.
- The formula for a failed workout: wake up, drink caffeine only. Fast. Drive & eat food immediately before the workout, then go to the gym. That is the pattern that seems to be the least condusive to performance. Working out fasted is better.

Components of body control:
- Sit in the car, drinking coffee, listening to music. Scanning the body. The drive is also part of the warmup. If you're short on time, or you've had a hard work day & you're tired or whatever, that's the time to start to reign that in or something. It's like changing from a doomscrolling derp state to standing up and walking to your refrigerator to start cooking. It's actually pretty hard.
- That's where the mental warmup starts to ramp up. Pre-gym meditative states.

How do you know who you are? What's true?


Experience with the body produces confidence & security.
You learn how to think for yourself. When you eat food and feel a certain way, you can go learn about inflimation, fodmaps, etc ...
The process of sifting through the noise of information.
There are a few pieces of information that you can use to create your own system of training that you will know 100% will work.
Through experience you need to learn which principles are true.
10 years ago or so, I listened to like many hundred podcasts on sports science. Passively.
How much volume should I do? How heavy? What split? What food, etc.
When you change diet and see a change in effect, that's as close to true as you'll get.
It's unrefutable in a non-precise way.
I can spot deceptions others walk around with.
- Oprah Winfrey writing a book on weight loss. People actually buy the book.

We aren't going to solve the "mind-body problem" by looking at the brain. Shut up and go to the gym.


Bodybuilding as a path to shadow work ??

Become who you're afraid to be.

Looking the devil in the eyes. Psyllopsybin I think shouldn't be done by people who don't have the level of mastery. Same thing with weed.
I think weed is unbelievably dangerous when used mindlessly.

Socrates says there's no downside to being in good shape.


Attraction to yoga - 
1) Psychopsomatic grief pain healing
- 1) Tearing - from Dan Dimartini - write down anything that brings a tear to your eye.


Nietzsche - mind & body are one.
![[Pasted image 20231203081557.png]]
The next question is on drives.

This is really where my obsession lies.
Hedonism (c4) was the initial hook.

Christian Hedonism (John Piper) - overflowing grace - spews out of you and you feel compelled to do good works in the world. Good works in the world aren't done out of obligation. There exists a drive from within you.

Drive - valuations. Goal oriented. Interpretive processes. Give meaning.

Nietzsche gave credit to the Cartesian Dualism view of the body for giving unity to our mental experience, but he didn't think that our mind was unified because in his view it was composed of many disparate drives. There either is no unified character, or it's an illusion.
Nietzsche thought it wasn't only wrong, but dangerous, because it leads to a devaluing of the body & the physical world it belongs to.

Earthly credibility was also probably an influential. I started ignoring what people said and I just looked at how they behaved. How they walk, stand, whether there's tension in their face or body. What kind of emotional state they walk around in. I got tired of thinking & arguing. I look around universities, and I don't see much vitality. I don't see people who are turned on. Presenly engaged & aware.

In the gym I can:
- Be present
- Turn on my body's painkillers
- Feel highs (pump)
- Jam to music
- Get emotional with my mind if I want to - including tearing
- Something about being around people, knowing you're being watched. There's some kind of exchange going on. There's a contributing to and a feeding of of the environment. I never work out alone.
- - I like being around people, but not necessarily talking to them. There's communication of presence or something like that.

One form of heaven on earth?-
- The richness of intimate experiences. Not necessarily sexual, although
- Sexual potency - women crave intimacy badly.
- - I like to foreplay, talk for hours, massage, make out; also sex daily. Preferably for hours, but, I can literally have sex round the clock for a month straight; time flies by and your life slips through your finger tips. That's the drug-level intoxication. I can go full addict. It's kind of easy to snap out of that and reign that in.
- - - I could talk to gfs about this - they're very sex positive.

Todo: Intelligence in the body.

![[Pasted image 20231203084426.png]]

I think it's criminal to talk about complicated heady stuff without having physical adeptness. It should be an immediate implication. Put your beliefs to the test. It's like complaining about being depressed. Maybe you want to be there, I don't know.

I can speak with authority on this topic because I'm talking about my own life.


"Body is implicitly contextualizing".


"Body is implicitly contextualizing".
You relate from the body - it's the preexisting context you were born into. From that you contextualize everything else (a la piaget & those guys).

The embodiment informs the categorization of the world in order to achieve things.


Authority - integrity of the body. Glaucon gives voice to the security of the integrity. Is your argument intact? There's a limitation to that b/c it splits. It could be wrong, or unintelligible.


....
Rebut:
Yoga = monism.
It's a Hindu liturgy.
- Which movements? Which movements? You're too lazy to explain exactly which god doing a Sun Salutation A or a Sun Salutation B is worshiping, and how it works, and why it's dangerous - these criticisms are hard to take seriously; these people get invited onto these large
"Not christian" - it's different & not compatible...


Hubermans idea - there's only 1 currency, dopamine.


Dostoyevsky was a beauty first guy. I learned to be a beauty first person from bodybuilding in ways I don't understand. Learned that there's power in the hand, that thoughts become things,

Feeling clearly. Body intelligence. Meditation of the body. Putting consciousness into the body. Body leads the mind. It's the primary faculty in intelligibility. Rhetoric is downstream from discernment. Discernment is physical first.

Can use BB to understand yourself. Understand your feelings, cultivate desire. Dream. Set goals, prioritize your time. Have to start with energy, though.

Bodybuilding can help with confidence. Can help you to stop hiding.
