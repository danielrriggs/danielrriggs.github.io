####  Do not vomit what you did not digest well enough
"Those who know don’t talk. They don’t talk for the sake of talking, or to prove something, or to display themselves. They talk only if it’s appropriate (and if they feel like talking). Those who talk don’t know: This is ignorance, not the openness of not-knowing."
- Lao Tze

"For even sheep do not vomit up their grass and show to the shepherds how much they have eaten; but when they have internally digested the pasture, they produce externally wool and milk. Do you also show not your theorems to the uninstructed, but show the acts which come from their digestion"
- Epictetus

"These names of virtues, with their precepts, were: 1. Temperance. Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation. Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation."
- Benjamin Franklin

"If any conversation should arise among uninstructed persons about any theorem, generally be silent [...] And when a man shall say to you, that you know nothing, and you are not vexed, then be sure that you have begun the work (of Philosophy)."
- Epictetus

"Words are weapons, words are gifts, words are not wasted."
- Pierre Bottero
