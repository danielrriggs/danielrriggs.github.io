### The Symposium (Group lectio divina book club)

The group lectio divina book club. Is intending to go through historical text and make them come alive to each other. We’re specifically intending to relate to how they resonate with us and what the symbolic interpretations we can make through the text.

When we end up finding a relevant virtue we’ll do a short dialogos on it in the context of the text.

The Symposium is one of the iconic texts written by Plato. He’s exploring love (Eros) as a concept from multiple perspectives and how this relates to being a philosopher.

### Process of Intention Setting

When setting the intentions it is important that everyone envision how they would enact that intention and resolve for themselves to commit to it. This helps to set a container and put you into the proper mindset for the experience.  Setting of intentions also engenders the proper open mindedness to allow your interaction with the experience to become sacred to you.

### Intentions



What intentions are not:

- Promises - you do not need to hold yourself to a standard of perfection
    
- Requirements - there are not things you have to do absolutely in all cases
    
- Goal - intentions may not manifest in the manner you expect them to
    

  
  

The purpose of intentions is to point you in a direction so that you pay attention to and echo signals in a certain direction. This is part of the process of proper focus which is a core component of setting a container and keeping it sacred.

  

When relating within the container imagine yourself being at the service of the container.

Intentions generate an orientation from which you can relate to the conversation/text. Whenever you get distracted you can return to your intentions to find a perspective to re engage. 

  

- Do not try to contribute when it is not furthering the spirit of the conversation. We’re intending to construct something through the perspectives of the participants. So whenever you are volunteering make sure you are aware how you can connect it to the subject.
    
- When we’re exploring the text try and explore the meaning of the symbols and what they represent.
    
- We’re trying to find the interrelatedness of the symbols and what they could mean for us.
    
- Silence is a contribution. Aim to speak from your intention. If it is not clear to you what is intention and what is reactivity, choosing silence is a good practice.
    

  

### Introduction

The facilitator of the event describes the current context of the reading.

- Where are we in the text
    
- What happened before in the text
    
- What associations were explored
    
- Expectations for the session
    
- What the text means to them
    

### Method

#### Reading

- Select a participant who starts reading the text. Allow for a dynamic rotation of readers during the practice and let people volunteer to read.  
    The reader starts reading the text, until you feel that something in the text speaks out to you. 
    
- Repeat the line that stands out to you and start making emotional connections that appear to you. 
    

- Create a space for other people to respond
    

- When people have something meaningful to add they can volunteer their perspective.
    
- After the emotional relevance has been exhausted we shift the focus on the symbols. Try to make associations and interpret the intentions of the writer of the text.
    

- Create a space for other people to respond
    

- When the symbols are forming around a specific virtue lift out the virtue and do a small session of dialogs on it.
    
- If there is no virtue standing out change reader or let the reader continue
    

  

#### Dialogos

- The reader describes the virtue that stands out and gives a concise understanding of it.
    
- Whoever feels called out can restate the given perspective
    
- Then they can add their own concise interpretation to the virtue
    
- Allow everyone to have a say
    
- When the topic is exhausted return to the reading
    

### Closing

Group articulation of maxim (Maxim game to be defined)

Or go around and state any maxim you may have found

  

### Integration

  

The integration is there to provide contextual interpretation to what has been experienced within the session. It is thereby setting up for integration into your life.

- Everyone in sequence spends a bit of time sharing what they’re taking away from the ritual
    
- You reflect on how things moved you emotional
    
- You relate things back to yourself and your life
    
- You consider what changes you can make in your life as a consequence of your insights
    
- How can you expand those ideas into your consciousness, cognition, character and communitas
