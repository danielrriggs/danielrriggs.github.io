When we think about "motivation", we think about concepts like [[Procrastination]], "follow through", and [[Confidence]].

When we understand how the brain chooses to do something, all of these things will become clear. We think about motivation as a static quality, but that isn't how motivation works; motivation is a constantly ongoing calculation.

The action success calculation has 3 components:
1) The benefit - if I engage in the behavior, what am I going to get?
2) The cost
3) The likelihood of success
Most of the problems we experience with motivation come out of the subtleties of this equation: **Benefit - Cost * Success Probability = Motivation**

###### Benefit
When we engage in a behavior, we may have an idea of the benefit, but the brain has no ***experience*** of the benefit.
- *Example: the advantages of quitting smoking at the age of 21 is that you don't have heart disease, strokes, and COPD at the age of 60. But, when your brain gets a hit of nicotine, the only cost it sees is "cigarettes are expensive" (which is why public health authorities put a sin tax on them - it's to try to make the costs more salient to people).*
- *Exercise is like this. You may intellectually know many benefits of exercise, but the brain sees little reward for doing it in the short term.*
The [[Reward Circuitry]] doesn't respond to ideas. It responds to experiences. The problem with motivation is that the benefit is realized so far after the behavior.
**As long as our sense of the reward is an idea, we won't find intrinsic motivation.**
- *Reading books about quitting smoking won't help you very much. You'll get a little benefit, but not much.*

###### Cost
All behaviors have a cost. Much like how our brain makes all kinds of mistakes in other parts of our "motivational calculations" (like the [[Prediction reward error processing|prediction reward error]]), it also oftentimes makes mistakes in the costs.
If we overestimate costs, it results in [[Procrastination]]. If we underestimate costs, it results in follow-through problems.
When the cost is really high, it decreases motivation, and we wait till the last minute.
- *Studying for the test the night before.*
If we can find the appropriate cost, it'll reduce our tendency to procrastinate.

If we underestimate costs, we abandon tasks (don't follow through).
- *Like learning a new instrument or a new language. These things are hard. People run on willpower for a bit when them, and end up abandoning them.*

###### Likelihood of success
If something has a high likelihood of success, we're going to do it. Low likelihood of success, not gonna do it.
How does the brain assess the likelihood of success?
This is where [[Confidence]] comes in.
- *How confident is a 25 year old person who has never been on a date in their life when they try to go on a first date, ever? As the become 28, what happens to their perception of likelihood of success? As they become 32 years old? Their confidence tanks. Their perception starts by being a bit behind, then as time goes on and their confidence drops, the desperation and desire will get them to go on dates - they'll use willpower (or alcohol), force themselves into a date, be unable to relax, won't have a good time, & won't have a second date. The likelihood of success plumets & they get trapped. Their brain starts to tell them devastating things: "don't bother. don't try. it won't work. the chances of success are zero. you're going to be alone for the rest of your life." Because that's what they learned. This person's friends might say "Just do it; You're a good person; I like hanging out with you; You're good looking; You have interesting hobbies, etc" - they can see the probability of success without the (negative) [[Confidence]] bias. But this person's [[Confidence]] doesn't let them see those things.*
**The brain doesn't explicitly tell you that you what you fear.** You won't **feel** that. **It won't tell you that you have a confidence problem**. It will just tell you that you aren't going to be successful. It just tells this person, "You're going to be alone forever." It doesn't say, "This is a [[Confidence]] problem, by the way."

Another example is a person who wants to be an author and is struggling with motivation to write.
- *This person has psychological defense mechanisms which tell them "You'll never get published. No one will like your work, etc*
Because the brain never says explicitly says that you have a [[Confidence]] problem, we go looking external solutions for motivation - they go to conferences, join writing groups, buy self help courses, etc - these things *can* help with writing, but they're **tools** to boost [[Productivity]]
The key thing to keep in mind is that **tools to help with productivity are dependent upon you believing that you can succeed.**
As people externalize the sources of their motivation; as they stop looking within themselves and fixing internal problems, they handicap the brain's action success calculation (**Benefit - Cost * Success Probability = Motivation**). Instead of joining a writing group, what this person needs to do is develop [[Confidence]]; which isn't easy, but, this person probably isn't aware that they have a [[Confidence]] problem. That's not the diagnosis they give themselves. They think they're "lazy".

The fascinating thing is that, if you want to boost your motivation, you can do internal work. You can start to think about your self, your self-esteem, where you lost confidence; what are some things you can do to build confidence. Very few authors think that something they can do to get motivation to write is to climb a 16,000 foot mountain. They don't connect those two dots. But when they climb a 16,000 foot mountain, they feel better about themselves, they feel confident about themselves. They wake up the next day & say, "I did that, so I can do this."

The real question to ask ourselves is, where is the brain determining that the cost is so high? We procrastinate on things we perceive as hard.

The last thing is follow through. If we don't think about the costs properly and we just jump into a task, we give up. And then we become people who give up.

The problem with stacking the odds in your favor is readiness - when are you ready? When are the odds in your favor enough? Stacking the odds can help, but when we're talking about *motivation*, then what we have to focus on is [[Confidence]].

We don't need to reach for external solutions. We need to understand how our brain decides to take action & not take action.
Am I overestimating the cost?
Do I not understand what the benefits are? Does my brain and body know what the advantage of doing this are?
