[[Sleep]] is vital.

Productivity is the joyous pursuit of execution.

Scaling Yourself by Scott Hanselman
[[Scaling Yourself by Scott Hanselman]]
You have a finite # of character strokes in you before you die. **Email is where character strokes go to die**. Instead of responding to one person in an email at work, create a wiki page that answers the question & email them the link. This is an example of behavior that is more scalable.

Keep it simple & focus on execution.
Being productive may not even be a good goal for you. It depends on where you are in life. Maybe you should be focused on enjoying life.


Time Management

Your entire life can be one giant waste of time.
**Ruthless Prioritization** - there are lots of decent good ideas, but they may not be good enough to warrant attention.
- Ex: Coupon clipping - ROI for the time that went into it is low.
Guard your [[Attention]]. Big tech is tailored to drain your time.
The highest level of mastery is simplicity.
Most information is irrelevant, and most effort is wasted.
Reading & watching videos, is not to consume information. That's endless. It's for my own meditation.

Law of Work - work expands to fill time. Death trap in which nerds spend time reading & learning meaningless drivel, not having accomplished anything.
Key: Practical application of information - how you organize it and apply it.
At my most productive, I am not reading blogs, I am executing, because I know what I need to do.
Going to school is for people who don't know what they're doing. It's supposed to just broaden your horizons.
How much time do you spend executing? Probably not much because you spend time too much time consuming.
Your job is also not the goal. It's simply meant to sustain you.
Reading a book is, say, 2% productive.
Maybe the best thing you can do is start a project or business.
Nerds are obsessed with the [[image]] of productivity instead of application.
- Do you care about appearing smart?
Many chase the [[image]] of success.
Following the news is for people who **don't know what they're doing with their lives**. You're trying to explore your options and opportunities. Maybe this is what notetaking is for.

1) Have a clean workspace

Mental State
Find ways to enter into & stay in [[Flow State]].
- [[John Demartini]] - observe & write down the things that bring a tear to your eye. Map these feelings & experiences to your values. This can help you stay in alignment more.

Raise your standards. Success is fun. It's better than frivolity.
- Get used to carving out lots of time & getting it done. Uninterrupted. Work on targeted, highly prioritized work.

Visualize who you are. Have a vision for yourself.

Fast computer, big monitor, fast internet, helps.
Get rid of as many tedious tasks as possible.
Voice commands - todo reminders of things to get done, daily.
Minimalizing your lifestyle
- Every day, take a look at 1 thing that wasted your time.
Regexp

[[Energy production]] is the one single most important factor in every single thing you do. Ability for your nervous system to function, brain to function, muscles to contract, hormones. The rate of energy production per unit time.
The earth, sun affect this. Prioritize it.

Oftentimes, if we can take off our brakes, we don't need to worry about applying the gas pedal.
- Example of brakes in [[bodybuilding]]: ineffective training, poor diet,

Is what I'm doing now the best thing I could be doing to achieve my mission (or goal)?

[[Cal Newport]] - Life is about doing, not hoarding knowledge. Put the knowledge to work. 80/20. If your marginal returns on your productivity is starting to fall off.

Balance learning for the sake of **doing** vs just exploring (learning that isn't directed to a known goal).
Concepts vs applications (concept = a fundamental thing we can all agree on) (application - a demonstration of a concept).
- (Seek to collapse many applications to a fewer # of more generic concepts).
