Lectio Divina comes from Catholicism: 
In Catholicism, Lectio Divina (Latin for "Divine Reading") is a traditional monastic practice of scriptural reading, meditation and prayer intended to promote communion with God and to increase the knowledge of God's word.[1] In the view of one commentator, it does not treat scripture as texts to be studied, but as the living word.[2]
Traditionally, Lectio Divina has four separate steps: read; meditate; pray; contemplate. First a passage of scripture is read, then its meaning is reflected upon. This is followed by prayer and contemplation on the Word of God.[3]

However John Vervaeke has adapted it as a secular practice. The reader reads something aloud with the goal of internalizing it. Relevant instructions from the Meditation with John Vervaeke series: https://youtu.be/j_dUgJCja48
