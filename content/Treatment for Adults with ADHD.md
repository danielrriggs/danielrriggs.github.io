There are two major types of **therapy** for ADHD:
- [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|CBT]] Focuses on improving organizational skills, reducing distractions, prioritizing tasks, and managing emotions.
- **Psychodynamic therapy:** Addresses the emotional consequences of growing up with ADHD, such as shame, low self-esteem, and trauma.

There's stimulant **medication** & non-stimulant medication. Note that stimulant medications have side effects (they "rev up" the whole body - heart rate, blood pressure, etc).

Eat clean.

You'll probably have to try different things to see what works for you. Diagnosis & treatment of [[ADHD]] are both pretty variable.
