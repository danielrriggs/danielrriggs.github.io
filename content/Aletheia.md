A greek term typically translated as truth or unconcealment.

For Heidegger, aletheia is not just about uncovering facts or discovering hidden truths, but rather it is a way of being in the world that involves a constant opennness to and engagement with one’s surroundings.

In Classical Greek, the word lethe (λήθη) literally means "oblivion", "forgetfulness", or "concealment.” The Greek word for "truth", a-letheia (similar to a-theism) (ἀλήθεια), literally means "un-forgetfulness" or "un-concealment."

Aletheia attunes the knower and the known, is more primordial than, and makes possible the objective and subjective notions of truth. Aletheia affords subjectivity and objectivity, and is profoundly [[Transjective]].
