"on the assumption that the world whose existence is independent of our sensation and perception consists solely of ‘particles,’ two operations are necessary (and whether they are successive or simultaneous is of no consequence), in order to produce the familiar world we know. First, the sense-organs must be related to the particles in such a way as to give rise to sensations; and secondly, those mere sensations must be combined and constructed by the percipient mind into the recognizable and nameable objects we call ‘things’." One of Barfield's key points is that we participate in this perceptive process. (Doug Wesney)
