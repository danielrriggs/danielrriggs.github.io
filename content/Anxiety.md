Anxiety is a psychological, physiological, and behavioral state induced in animals and humans by a threat to well-being or survival, either actual or potential. It is characterized by increased arousal, expectancy, autonomic and neuroendocrine activation, and specific behavior patterns.

Your body's natural response to stress. It's a feeling of fear or apprehension about what's to come. 
- The first day of school, going to a job interview, or giving a speech may cause most people to feel fearful and nervous.

Anxiety is a very rapid thought process that bounces all over the place.
