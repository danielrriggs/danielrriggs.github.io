This term refers to the phenomenology of [[Relevance Realization]] in terms of meaning-making. Religio is “the sense of a pre-egoic and ultimately post-egoic binding that simultaneously grounds the self and its world.” It is the generalized referencereferene of something like religion.  This overlaps with the kind of meaning-making that has been gathered together in many discourses in the term “spirituality”.

Salient features/aspects of religio that [[Relevance Realization]] can account for:
The possibility of complexification, of self-transcendence
The possibility of self-deception, bullshitting
Connectedness
Perspectival knowing
Participatory knowing
Caring, significance
The cognitive continuum from fluency, to insight, to flow, to altered states of consciousness, to higher states of consciousness.
Fundamental framing

The term religio is being used deliberately. It recalls the word “religion” and its connotations, but its meaning is not identical to the word religion. Religio is one of the purported etymological origins of the word “religio”, coming from the latin “Religare”, meaning literally “to read back”, or “to bind together”, “reconnect”.
