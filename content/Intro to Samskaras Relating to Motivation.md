- [[Samskara]]sÂ are undigested emotions that can manifest as negative thoughts, such as:
    - It doesn't matter what I do.; I can't afford to make a mistake; I can't afford to waste any more time; This works for others, but not for me.
- These thoughts can also manifest as a lack of readiness ("I'm not ready") or a sense of stuckness.
- To overcome these Samskaras, we need to:
    - Notice their action in the mind.
	    - *[[Samskara]]s control us by remaining hidden. They trick us into believing that they're actually truth as opposed to thoughts or cognitive distortions.*
    - Reframe and shift our thoughts in a healthier direction.
    - Trace them back to their origins in past experiences and process the undigested emotional energy. *Think, when was it formed?**
