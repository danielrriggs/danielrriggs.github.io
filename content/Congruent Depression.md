A non-clinical [[Depression]]. An experience of depression that is appropriate, or "congruent" to life circumstances. Depression that is not caused by a neurochemistry imbalance or is not a malfunction of the brain, like an "existential depression."

- Constant, often years-long depression.
- Occurs when an individual feels stuck in life and lacks hope.
- Not an illness, but rather a response to life circumstances.
- Solutions involve addressing the underlying problems in the individual's life, such as psychotherapy, personal growth, and self-reflection.
