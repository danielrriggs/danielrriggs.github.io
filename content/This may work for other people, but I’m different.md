Any kind of individuality that we have can be one of two things. It can either be a roadblock or a roadmap.

Respond to obstacles & disadvantages by controlling what you can control.

The "I'm different" excuse can become an excuse for all sorts of unrelated things.
- *Example: someone with a belief that lack of success in dating is due to being short. This excuse has nothing to do with working on communication skills, being out of shape, finances, etc.*
If you're rejected for your height, this attribute of your [[Ego|ahamkara]] acts as a shield, protecting you from looking at other parts of yourself.

Attacking the belief itself ("that's not true, that's not true, that's not true") backfires & actually hardens the [[samskara]]. Our [[Ego|ahamkara]] is stronger than our [[Buddhi]], so no amount of logic will be able to unpack it. Instead of trying to convince yourself you can still be successful despite the samskara, you need to figure out what the samskara is protecting your from.
- *What does this [[Samskara]] allow me to excuse about myself?*

These negative beliefs excuse us from effort & responsibility. As you tunnel into what your beliefs excuse you from, you'll start to figure out how to dismantle it. As you start to take responsibility for those things, your confidence will grow & you will be able to move forward.
