- **The "I'm Different" [[Samskara]]:** Our minds may create obstacles based on perceived differences, leading us to believe specific actions won't work for us.
- **Protection and Excuses:** This scar can serve as a protection mechanism, excusing us from taking responsibility for our actions.
- **Overcoming the Scar:** To overcome this scar, we need to identify what it protects us from and what it allows us to excuse about ourselves.
- **Taking Responsibility:** By taking responsibility for our own actions, we can dismantle the [[Samskara]] and build confidence.

Any kind of individuality that we have can be one of two things. It can either be a roadblock or a roadmap.

Respond to obstacles & disadvantages by controlling what you can control.


The "I'm different" excuse can become an excuse for all sorts of unrelated things.
- Example: someone with a belief that lack of success in dating is due to being short. This excuse has nothing to do with working on communication skills, being out of shape, finances, etc.
If you're rejected for your height, this attribute of your [[Ego|ahamkara]] acts as a shield, protecting you from looking at other parts of yourself.
