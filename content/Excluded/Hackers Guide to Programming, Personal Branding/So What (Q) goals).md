How did you get into programming?
	Why are you doing it?

Do you like it?

What's different across:
	Time
	Employment Environment
	Experience (you change)
		For example, WMT sucked. Worked alot. Learned not to / to see what's valuable.
			Learned that the principle I was employing in school is sub-optimal for corporate environment & unsustainable - outworking people.
				An exercise in unlearning.
					Unlearning & challenging your habits, beliefs, and tools became a part of my process.
						For example, I'm changing jobs right now and am challenging
							Angular
							GCP
							Criticizing my understanding of the way that my last few jobs have played out
								Design - & general technical implementation
								Interpersonal dynamics
								Politics
