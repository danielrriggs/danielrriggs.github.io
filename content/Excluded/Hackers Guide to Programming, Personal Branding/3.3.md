Programming Evils:
Mutability
Complicated syntax (which hides important mechanism)
Mathematical envy
Coding in Source files - focus on notation rather than on how abstractions relate to eachother
Focus on Code, not Data. Focus on what we're doing, not what we're doing it for (or with).
Dynamic scoping of symbols (anti modular). (ex: in scripting language, assign something a symbol & it springs to life). Defining a symbol is low effort. You get into typo oriented programming, which is damaging.
Nulls
