[5 Used SUVs You Should Buy - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsUPlNlNhi8)
2016 Honda CRV
- Get the 2WD one (not AWD)

2016 Acura RDX (same co as Honda. More Luxurious).
Long stopping distance. Heavy.

2016 Toyota Rav 4
- Safe. Good visibility.

2016 Toyota Highlander (there's a 4cy, 6cy). 6cy more popular.
Lots of room. Lots of space. Best SUV in that size range & for that price.

2016 Lexus RX 350. Expensive. But good. 300 HP.
