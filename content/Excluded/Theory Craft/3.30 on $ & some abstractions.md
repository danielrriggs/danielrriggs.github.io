the job fallacy -
they create systems. MIS process.
Ex: spending $1M on automation - how's that affect financials? & therefore, where attention goes?
what's the structure of a story? or, how does attention work? Salience landscaping.
service sector - 
what value (create) does the manager @ insurance company create?
barista - there's the coffee.
What does Manhattan export?

Value & Attention

Personal brand: excellence, competence, integrity - style of leadership. grizzled sergeant. but, it's hard.

BS Jobs - Soviet labor hoarding (pride in labor ethos)
Capitalism - Successfull project on some BS Beaurecratic system shrouded in jargon (ex: "streamline customer experience") to make themselves look good.

idea for system: take the arguments. put documentation. explain it like its a CS problem.

40 hr wk - to drive demand for the car.
hermenutic of suspicion - noise (bad quality info) - we need filters we trust. a network of observers.
