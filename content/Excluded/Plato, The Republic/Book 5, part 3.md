"Perfect implementation of justice at the scale of a city."
... What about this condition?
We need to sacrifice truth on the altar of justice. To make sure children of the same parents don't interbreed. Problem implementing justice & ... implementing other ...

When the word & deed become one is a functional definition of truth.
reasoning vs disputing
fact vs opinion
verbal (wordy) truth vs maybe the deed.
heuristic vs dialectic


Motivational primitives
"He did that for Instagram"
fame, money, that person wanted a relationship
Decode those motivations > 
A motivation is something more like a static quality. Vs a dynamic quality. Dialectic. It's dancelike.

Columbo - Actually attending to things. Led by feeling. Always talking about the nose.
Think not paying attention.

Crime scene - you got a lighter? you got a lighter? What do you think about livin here on the river? My wife loves fishing. Do you like fishing?

Reality, I see this now that I'm older, he's a master monk detective. He pays very close attention. He's very skilled with people. Playing different bad guys against eachother. Lays traps for them. He pays attention to relationships. Feeling is needed to do that. He always talks about the nose.
That's actually necessary in order for the fact to fall into place, or come to light.


Mechanical - 


War vs Discord
Discord - internal or something & not for destruction.
War - external or like the telos or goal is destruction. Burn it to the ground.

**Godell's Incompleteness Theorem**

Epistemic stuff - heuristics are limited. dialectic.

People stuck in relativism (like the cave) - 
1) Affirm the values of the others knowledge (the thing you know is real & is of value). But, what is it you're knowing? Abstracting the knowledge from the direct experience. The thing you're knowing is that which is. The thing that is not cannot be known. Things that are (being) & not being. (Knowledge? Epistemic) ... corresponds to being.
2) Say something 
3) What is not cannot be known
4) Knowledge corresponds to being.


Definition of knowledge?: Is?
When you know something, you know what is.
Knowledge corresponds to being. It's relative to being and knows being. It's a verb.


Knowledge is your grasp on being.
None being, you can't know about.


What's opinion? Neither being or non-being.

It's between knowing being & not knowing being. It's put into context within a domain of functionality (telos), knowledge (gnosis), being, feeling.
Knowledge - defined by being.


Opinion is between knowledge & ignorance. It's the state of not knowing. Or the not knowable.


Something is to be grasped.

Epistemes is how we come to know things. It's not a thing. To know.


Opinion - special reference.
Put it between being & non-being.
Knowing & not knowing.
Being & not being.

Subject is the object of opinion (sphere).
Objects will be judged in 

They used this to create a third realm of things. The realm of opinion. That's where they break the spacial thing.

Lovers of opinion.
An opinion is something you don't fully grasp.

I've mapped this territory before. Or, I've mastered the procedures. If it's like a video or sports game.
Every game's a little different, but, a pro is going to go in co


If you see how they're all participating in beauty.
Someone who finds a flower beautiful can have a great relationship to flowers. Knowledge about the specific is insufficient.
Need knowledge about the universal to relate to the specific.


We have to get at Justice through Wisdom.


Adam - Historical, people's perspectives.
Domicile


Columbo's nose.
Song - better picture fades in.
Realizing that there's alot that is not known.

Battle of lookout mountain.

Washington crossing Delaware -

	- Leverage & terrain.
	- South: Browning rifles. Let's shoot the leaders. Rest through treachery.
