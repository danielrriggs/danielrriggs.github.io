Not one of the elect.
Almost like an election. Didn't say or hint that it's hereditary.


Education & the philosopher king
Competent practically & in understanding higher things (justice, morality, & the Forms).

The Philosopher - 
	- Not the many
	- Must have clear patterns of the true, just, and beautiful.
	- Lover of the knowledge of the eternal and of all truth
	- Hater of falsehood
	- Meaner desires are absorbed in the interests of knowledge
	- Spectators of all time and all existence
	- In the magnificence of their contemplation the life of man is as nothing to them
	- Death is not fearful
	- Of a social, gracious disposition, equally free from cowardice and arrogance
	- Learn and remember easily
	- They have harmonious, well-regulated minds
	- Truth flows to them sweetly by nature

(Later, by corollary) (492)
- Must not yield to opinion
- Follows the gentle compulsion of exile or death

Response:
- (allegory of) The Captain Mutiny
	- Pretend the crew possess no knowledge of piloting & there's no naval academy for training new captains.
	- The crew are the politicians. The captain is the Sophist (or philosopher?). There are lots of corrupting influences.
		- Knowledge itself
		- Money
		- Fame / Power
		- Bad taste by brutes (where the standards of the true & beautiful just suit the day)
		- Politicians


Society is not conducive to producing philosophers. It's very corrupting. The politicians


"Further, I would have you consider that the hireling Sophist only gives back to the world their own opinions; he is the keeper of the monster, who knows how to flatter or anger him, and observes the meaning of his inarticulate grunts. Good is what pleases him, evil what he dislikes; truth and beauty are determined only by the taste of the brute. Such is the Sophist’s wisdom, and such is the condition of those who make public opinion the test of truth, whether in art or in morals."


Even if we find the right seed for a philosopher, which is rare, we need the right conditions. (493) makes it sound impossible.

Public opinion corrupts the opinion of 

Is philosophy useless?


The order of things
"When I look at a trash can, I know it's a trash can, but I don't know why".
What's relevant is the order.
You don't see what you don't see. You see through participation. That's the only true way of seeing.


Implications: Submit to authority.


Pattern: Seed & soil
Affordances (potentiality) (eye pre-exists. Sun pre-exists. Gravity pre-exists. Whatever. There's a realm that exists before the realm that agency operates in.)

One And The Many Theme (unity - multiplicity):
Contrasting Unity of the idea, against a the multiplicity of phenomena.

It's more like the interface of relationship between the upper & lower realm can be -a matrix one-.


Bad interpretations?:
Soil parable - 
	- Some fell on the paths & the birds ate it.
		- "Satan" = birds. Message is immediately lost.
	- Some fell on rocky ground w/ little soil. So, the sun burnt the young plants.
		- People with initial enthusiasm but it didn't "sink in". Can't suffer hard times (the sun).
	- Some fell among thorns, which choked them.
		- People's concern for life worries (others think; maybe materialism?)
