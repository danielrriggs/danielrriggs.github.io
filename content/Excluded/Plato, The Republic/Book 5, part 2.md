Relation of the sexes - **opposites**.

Men vs Women natures

**Contradiction** - heuristic vs dialectic - 454??
Because I think that many a man falls into the practice against his will. When he thinks that he is **reasoning** he is really **disputing**, just **because he cannot define and divide**, and so know that of which he is speaking; and he will pursue a merely verbal opposition in the spirit of contention and not of fair discussion.

Ideals

Opinion & Knowledge
(faculties) - // remember when they were talking about the faculty of the eye, or the ear.


472 D - Ideal State
We were enquiring into the nature of absolute justice and into the character of the perfectly just, and into injustice and the perfectly unjust, that we might have an ideal. (1) The ideal is a standard only which can never be perfectly realized; We were to look at these in order that we might judge of our own happiness and unhappiness according to the standard Dwhich they exhibited and the degree in which we resembled them, but not with any view of showing that they could exist in fact.
...
"And is our theory a worse theory because we are unable to 170 prove the possibility of a city being ordered in the manner described?""

We created an ideal of the perfect State.

473 - Philosopher King introduced
"_Until philosophers are kings, or the kings and princes of this world have the spirit and power of philosophy, and Dpolitical greatness and wisdom meet in one, and those_ 171 _commoner natures who pursue either to the exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside, cities will never have rest from their evils,—nor the human race, as I believe,—and then only will this Eour State have a possibility of life and behold the light of day"

"Had to invent monotheism for it to work." - in Ch2.
Need the unification under one banner.
Plurality or Unification (in nature) - plurality is evil.
Education > if it's towards a tellos. Then the pathway is irrelevant.
	We needed people who could read, write, do some math, ... if 10%, we can do more in society. ... Universal Sufferage. We're going to make it a right. We want equal opportunity. How to provide these things? Cut on equality.

beauty != not opposite of ugly.
Oppose - stand in contrast to??

The nature of looking at the inside vs the outside. Isn't looking at the shirt the same.
It's asymmetrical ... or, you could say it's a sphere.

absolute vs 

opinion vs knowledge

Manuel - 
Man vs women - destroying that category. Because that's not **the right way to judge**.
If you start using different categories - we start making 2 cases. They're not of the same nature. Literally. They cannot commune. They live in wisdom, while the other people don't.
How do we do education? It's only for the guardians. Not the other people.
... they're destroying the ideal nature of the city by recognizing that it cannot be.
Lying to people - putting them in a state that isn't real.
