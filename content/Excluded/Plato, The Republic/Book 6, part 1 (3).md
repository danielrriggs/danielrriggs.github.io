Philosophy useless - because it won't be used?

(509) The Divided Line
1) Images - Reflections; (Mirror, shadow, images - copies of things)
2) Material things. Real things (animals, plants, chalk board) - natural or manmade.
(Intelligible side of the line). Grasped by hypotheses.
3) ...
4) Forms or Ideas ... Form of the Good
... Dialectic


Taste of the fruit of their framing

Use of these abstractions?
World of Forms ... Good
Laws of Nature - sets of primitives build my thinking on.
Efforts to exapt - harder.


"Take the responsibility for being a leader" > makes no sense. The leadership is an intermediary step.
The act of convincing them points lower. A good leader will never point at leadership. They'll point higher, not lower. Then you have something to lead that you care about.


Are they objects, or images to something higher? Then, I can apply a different type of sensemaking.
Different way of dealing with things in the realm of forms. Because it isn't contingent upon time.
Math - way of relating not contingent across time.

"You understand me very well, I said. And now to those four divisions of knowledge you may assign four corresponding faculties—pure intelligence to the highest sphere; active intelligence to the second; to the third, faith; to the fourth, the perception of shadows—and the clearness of the several faculties will be in the same ratio as the truth of the objects to which they are related…."

"You have quite conceived my meaning, I said; and now, corresponding to these four divisions, let there be four faculties in the soul—reason answering to the highest, understanding to the second, faith (or conviction) to the third, and perception of shadows to the last—and let there be a scale of them, and let us suppose that the several faculties have clearness in the same degree that their objects have truth."

School of Rock - Jack Black is stoic
Morpheus - what if I told you ... all the philosophers already took all the blue pills?

"Minds eye" - what do you need to develop to relate to the eternal?
To develop a character.


Integrity - w/ study plan, diet plan, preparation in anything 
Meaning - reflex
(Practice - cleaning )
	"Work on myself so that I don't have to work on myself" ... ???
		"Is your heart there??"


"Encounter with the beast (nature, reality as such)"

??? Fall into the Hegelian dialectic ???
Is (descriptive, objects) - you need to be doing the Hegelian dialectic. If you reason on one level. 1st half on earth? 2nd half lifting up into the heavenly? On earth, you need to set things in opposition to have the contrast.
Otherwise, you presuppose some external reference.
Witkenstein figured out "language is wrong" after 10 years. It puts you in a certain position in reality. You go through language w/ logic. The Hegelian dialectic can move levels.

Ought (relational)

Language !== thought

Measuring your own thought w/ your internal dialogue.


Manuel - Knowledge - grip being. Removes it from being a static ??
The expression - constrained, but not static.
The form of the heart - the abstraction or the understanding of how to relate the heartness. To get out of it its essence. That is what a perspective is. That narrowed relationship of the grip. That would be building a body. Combining different organs into a higher being, or an embodied being.
What use is an ontology? You still need a relationship for ... ??? You have a personhood that comes from the wholeness of the body interacting.


- What role does faith play in 


Being ungrounded
Ungrounded
Breaking the 4th wall - taking the role of God. (participant observer). You're participating, then you're orientint. Vervake: Orienting in a way that's anti participation. What are you orienting for?
You're breaking your flow (participation) for what purpose? Only reason is you're misaligned with your purpose.

3rd wayism - denial of dialectic (middle path).
