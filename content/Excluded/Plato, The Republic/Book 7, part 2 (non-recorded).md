Understanding - to see the body that something consists of.
	Science - intelligize (not our understanding of science)

Opinion - a mere reflection of your experience.
	Belief - imposes itself on your experience.


Becoming - within time (world of the flesh; the earthly realm). Separated from emanation; related to emergence.
We have something stronger than opinions (beliefs). Are about the nature to what we have opinions about.
Being - 

To understand something - is to see the body that something consists of.

Spirit - animates. Same word as Wind. Wind blows through the trees, you don't see the wind, you see the effect of it on the trees. It's something that is moving something else, and thereby reveling itself. And you can participate in it. You can use the energy in the windmill & convert it into electricity.

Soul - The filter that you use to intelligize.
	Transmutation - Change its quality


Facility
We shape our Soul in the image of Christ.

We are like Angels, Your soul becomes an emanation that shines on the future of humanity. It's either towards Christ, or it's turned away from Christ.
Your soul will have a participation that exists through your death.
