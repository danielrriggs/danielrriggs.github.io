**Book 2 Summary**

- Glaucon puts forth 3 categories of goods:
	- 1) Those desireable for the sake of themselves.
		- Ex: Harmless pleasures / delights
	- 2) Those desireable for their own sake AND for the sake of their results.
		- Ex: Knowledge, sight, and health
	- 3) Those for the sake of their consequences, but are undesireable in themselves
		- Ex: Gymnastics; ways of making money
- Glaucon asks Socrates which category Justice belongs in -
	- Socrates response: It's in the highest category (category #2).
	- Glaucon agrees with Socrates; Glaucon says the majority of people place justince in the lowest category (category #3).
- Glaucon makes 3 arguments
	- 1) Demonstrates the nature & origin of Justince
		- The laws which are agreed upon and ordained are deemed just & lawful.
		- Origin: Experiencing & suffering evil, and an agreement to have neither.
	- 2) Proves that men behave according to justice against their own will
		- fe as they wish, the Just & Unjust person will behave the same (they will pusue the path in accordance with their own self interest and "happiness"). He says that people will only divert to the path of justice by force of laws.
			- Example: Gyges (a shepard). Once day, there's an earthquake. Gyges goes to check it out. He finds a ring from a dead more-than-human figure. He takes it. It makes him invisible. He seduces the queen, kills the king, and seizes the kingdom.
	- 3) Argues that the unjust life is better than the just life
		- Parents teach their kids to be just just for the rewards of being considered just.
		- Appearances tyranizes truth, and is lord of 'happiness'. A just man can be considered unjust, while an unjust man can be considered just, and accordingly, rewarded. Thus, Glaucon concludes that it's better to be unjust and appear just, because a man gains both the rewards of justice & injustice.
		- Furthermore, there is no need to conceal one's injustice from the gods. If the gods care about human interactions, a wealthy unjust man will better be able to appease them with sacrifices to attone for his injustice compared to a poor person.

Socrates Rebutal
- Justice is found in the individual as well as in the State (Wissem brought this point up last week).
- Because the State is larger than the individual, they will more easily discern Justice in the State. Therefore, they will more easily discern justice in the State, then proceed to the individual.

Being good vs seeming good

Socrates:
Just | Thought Unjust > Scourged

On the pious (hipo)
Parents and tutors are always telling their sons and their wards that they are to be just; but why? not for the sake of justice, but for the sake of character and reputation; in the hope of obtaining for him who is reputed just some of those offices ... for sake of character and reputation
External vs internal

Honesty is less profitable than dishonesty
What about Peterson - nobody gets away with anything?

They go on like this ... then say -
He proceeded: And now when the young hear all this said about virtue and vice, and the way in which gods and men regard them, how are their minds likely to be affected, my dear Socrates
The young quickwitted will say, I can ascend a liftier tower by way of deceipt which may produce a fortress for me all my days... therefore:
Since then, as philosophers prove, appearance tyrannizes over truth and is lord of happiness, **to appearance I must devote myself**

// Perhaps read from: 
"Can I by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier tower which may he a fortress to me all my days" ??

after laying out all the advantages of injustice,
"how can a man who has any superiority of mind or person or rank or wealth, be willing to honour justice"

The cause of all this, Socrates, was indicated by us at the beginning of the argument, when my brother and I told you how astonished we were to find that of all the professing panegyrists of justice --beginning with the ancient heroes of whom any memorial has been preserved to us, and ending with the men of our own time --no one has ever blamed injustice or praised justice except with a view to the glories, honours, and benefits which flow from them. No one has ever adequately described either in verse or prose the true essential nature of either of them abiding in the soul, and invisible to any human or divine eye; or shown that of all the things of a man's soul which he has within him, justice is the greatest good, and injustice the greatest evil

They wanted to arrive at the truth, first, about the nature of justice and injustice, and secondly, about their relative advantages

They wanted to arrive at the truth, first, about the nature of justice and injustice, and secondly, about their relative advantages. I told them, what I --really thought, that the enquiry would be of a serious nature, and would require very good eyes. Seeing then, I said, that we are no great wits, I think that we had better adopt a method which I may illustrate thus

Suppose: reading small letters at distance, but you can read the same letters larger. Why not do that?

He meant: The outside of the building should reflect the interior.
He meant: What you use it for should make what the form looks like.
No haenous brutalism BS. If you don't build a church like a voicebox, it doesn't function.
