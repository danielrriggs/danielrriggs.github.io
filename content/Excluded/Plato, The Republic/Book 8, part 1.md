Kalilipolis - each person does the right job for them.
Just person: soul is properly arranged.


Main Problem: There is no perfect. Fleeting. Any system is subject to the tyranny of its own existence.


The form of the good isn't approached empirically.


Operating simultaneously


Plato's Model of the Soul
Rational (ruling class)
Spirited (soldiers)
Appetitive (working class)


Evaluative Criterion ??
- (544) Are they happy (or, state of the soul)?
- What are their preoccupations / motivations (or, what's their fundamental value)?


Aristocracy > Timocracy
Breed out of cycle - math rambling
	Proportions


Degeneration of the Soul / Conception of the Good
Aristocracy > rule by best (Philosopher King)
	Rulers chosen based on spiritual insight??
	Founder - disconnected from the reason of the rule. Communing in making the city a success. Now there can be a division. It can sustain multiple heads (directions).


Timocracy (Govt of Crete & Sparta) > martial honor (some kind of natural excellence - courage / strength).
	They neglect the muses (music).
	

Oligarchy > Without philosophy, develop a covert love of wealth.
	As military prowess devolves into love of $, the conception of the good becomes fractured.
	What are the soldiers fighting for?
	What if the pilot is chosen based on wealth rather than merit?
	There are now 2 cities - the poor & the rich. The poor want to overthrow rich. The rich want to exploit poor.
	Enshrine injustice. People meddle in many affairs, doing them all poorly. Rulers will try to manage agriculture, medicine (b/c they see an opportunity to rule) (552).


Democracy - Rule by The Many
	Rulers chosen not on their own qualifications, but on their ability to make others feel sparkly.
	(555ish) Money Lending.
	Ruling families cannibalize each other.
	Fond of luxury. Fail to engage in life. 556 - the poor view the rich as inept / incompetent. E - This is a powder keg for Civil War.
	558ish - tolerant because they abandon objective criteria for rulership.
	Conception of the good: Absolute Freedom
		(563ish) 3 types of people: 1) Idlers (Drones); 2) Drone fodder 3) Productive class


Tyranny > Rule by Tyrant
	Slavery emerges from freedom.
	Distinctions between student / teacher dissolve.
	Stay in perpetual war so people need his leadership (566ish).
	War taxes keep people preoccupied with survival.
	(567e) He robs the people's slaves & makes them his bodyguards. The people hate him.
	(569b) The son beats up his father.
	(569c) The people's have slaves as their masters.


Cause
Or do you suppose that the regimes arise ‘from an oak or rocks? and not 
from the dispositions of the men in the cities, which, tipping the scale 
as it were, draw the rest along with them?”

Picking up from books 4 & 5 again, but now with
more 544 excellent things to relate both of State and man
...
States are as the men are; they grow out of human characters.

Constitution is circular.


Won't last forever
"everything which has a beginning has also an end, even a constitution such as yours will not last for ever, but will in time be dissolved"

Births out of cycle / season (546 D)
Undervalue Music; then undervalue gymnastic > produce less cultivated

iron and brass fell to acquiring money and land and houses and gold and silver


- Why it isn't a manual on 
	- Perfection is fleeting
	- Cycle - need to look @ whole cycle; else you can't judge.
- Book 7 - trajectory

- Time, energy, and attention
	- Personal meditations
		- Why am I pursuing what I'm pursuing?
		- Seasons in life.
			- Motivations change over time - sometimes you need to sharpen yourself; alot of obligations; cooking; driving elderly people to PT.
- Own goals - self sacrificial

- Mark's Intention: Exploring what others think

///////////////////////////////////////////
////////////////////// Starting
End of Book 7 is beginning of Book 8

Resurrects Book 4 & 5
After 50 - you're supposed to rule.
Trauma - worship these things; goes through the trajectory

End of book 7 - you have the architects guide the process.
Corruption seeps in 
Can't get at 


Cave - limited by birth (as a being). Physical material limitations.
- What is just is unfolding;
- What is just might be contingent upon the city you're in.

547 b - 

Men & women are drawn towards
Eunich 
Being a man
If it's your Nature, it isn't a sacrifice.

Wisdom of Hypatia - Epicureanism



Power - magnitude / scale / 
What's the relation of the power?
Thrasymachus - relative
	Perception
	Vacuous

Eventually, you can probably find a way to Absolutize the relative claim.
Find the standard. March the axioms back.

Socrates - Doesn't your power come from your subordinates?
	Ends up turning the argument on its head.
Cleaphis - perception
	Thrasymachus doesn't take the lifeline because it would make 
Ok, that's just your form, man > the dude. He's useless. That's not the form or the thing that was motivating Thrasymachus (Sophist). They want power for themselves. That corrupts their rational capacities.


If I cultivate things a certain way, they become unnatural ??


Nature - not conditioned upon you. Problem is it changes all the time.
Difference between the potential and the actual.
One thing to say I believe in something. It's another thing to try and make that happen.

Strongest doesn't always win
Pyric victory - you may not be around after the win to enjoy it.
