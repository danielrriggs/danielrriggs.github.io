- A word opens up a relationship
	- Live in this disconnected state

You can only have one role.
- They only have access to the gods through the poets
- Monotheism coming to life
- Rhetorical exploration ... not a set of claims


- There's no philosophy without religion. They aren't talking about the religious part because it's taken forgranted.
- Good in a good liffe; there's 3 aspects of the good.
	- in a social context
	- in relationship to the gods
- I don't think you need to know the good to call out evil.
	- Goodness & evil aren't opposites. just different directions.
- Justice - enacting the good.
	- harmonious
 
- Here's perfection, therefore we have to cut out all of these things. Perfection kills life.


- Do you have to be all of these roles to yourself?
- Guard your heart, mind & soul

- Balance

- Balance - If you overindex on business, you corrupt business, because it isn't subservient to anything. 


- Truth - grounding.
- Beauty - affordances (imbuing you with spirit).
- Participation - where you find the expression. You find yourself within that.
- Goodness @ the grounding. Truth is motion. If you ground in being is good, lot of problems go away.


What education is supposed to be.
Truth is the problem (The True - it's the arrow; how close you are to the thing). Truth is a target. True is not a target. True friendship is not a goal.
