Idas - more like pattern or paradigm.
They're the affordances of our knowing.


517 - world of sight
Salient != truthful
Inner conflict
Abstract symbols
You are social

"But, whether true or false, my opinion is that in the world of knowledge the idea of good appears last of all, and is seen Conly with an effort; and, when seen, is also inferred to be the universal author of all things beautiful and right, parent of light and of the lord of light in this visible world, and the immediate source of reason and truth in the intellectual; and that this is the power upon which he who would act rationally either in public or private life must have his eye fixed.
...
Moreover, I said, you must not wonder that those who attain to this beatific vision are unwilling to descend to human affairs; for their souls are ever hastening into the D upper world where they desire to dwell; which desire of theirs is very natural, if our allegory may be trusted.
...
The compelling to come down comes from the architect of the city."


518 C -
on Knowledge
Like Training vs Education. Education requires exercise.
Popular explanation of Socrates theory of knowledge - you don't put knowledge into people from the outside, you help people unlock the knowledge which they already have inside them by making the connections to the known.


518 B - 2 ways for the eyes to blind - light > dark or dark > light.
518 B says The philosopher has pity on the cave dwellers, but 519 D says 
"I mean that they remain in the upper world: but this must not be allowed; they must be made to descend again among the prisoners in the den, and partake of their labours and honours, whether they are worth having or not."


519 - The Rogue (Fallen reason, evil intelligence) - 
Wisdom (virtue) - contains a divine element and cane be used towards good or evil
(519) "the virtue of wisdom more than anything else contains a divine element which always remains, and by this conversion is rendered useful and profitable; or, on the other hand, hurtful and useless".


What makes a city Just? Tautology - hierarchy. City has a way to relate.
Invokes the city (do what's good for the body).
The philosopher king needs to city.


Ascent - being better able to see as a king (it's city, not cave).
Ivory tower of education - 519 C - the danger of being **overeducated**: "{they fancy} that they are already dwelling apart in the islands of the blest".
	Don't be a lifelong learner because then you won't do anything.


519 D - "I mean that they remain in the upper world:"


Self deception
Why do you the Smoke cigarette, eat the cake, etc (the monster)? Abstract thought to beat the monster? Override it, but minimally?
-
Freud divides psyche into id, ego, super ego;
Left & right brain
Reptile brain & abstract
-
Use reason to train your lion.
Dialogue (Plato's a playwright) using dialogue to train the man & to tame the monster.
Train the mind to reduce inner conflict.

Anagogue (greek word for ascent). Transformation process for ??
Adukeray - word for education ??
Wisdom - fullness of being.
-
The grasp on the logos (the structural functional) is intuitive.
Conformity is reciprocal?


// Mathy part
...
// Astronomy part
...
Reason & Intelligence vs sight. Senses vs reason. (Plato's answer: reason).

(529 B) "And you are very likely right, and I may be a simpleton: but, in my opinion, that knowledge only which is of being and of the unseen can make the **soul look upwards**".


531 C - 
"A thing, I replied, which I would rather call useful; that is, if **sought after with a view to the beautiful and good**; but if pursued in any other spirit, useless."

Dialectic vs math
"For when a man knows not his own first principle, and when the conclusion 237 and intermediate steps are also constructed out of he knows not what, how can he imagine that such a fabric of convention can ever become science?
Then dialectic, and dialectic alone, goes directly to the first principle and is the only science which does away with hypotheses in order to make her ground secure; the eye of D the soul, which is literally buried in an outlandish slough, is by her gentle aid lifted upwards; and she uses as handmaids and helpers in the work of conversion, the sciences which we have been discussing..."


"As being is to becoming, so is pure intellect to opinion.
And as intellect is to opinion, so is science to belief, and understanding to the perception of shadows."


Dialectician gets at the essence of things.

Ignorance about the objects (which is one thing,
"I know i know nothing, or I know what I know & what I don't").
Then there's the awareness - ignorance that they're ignorant. Sentence 1 in the book.

Farcicality of the metaphors.
Discernment is important.


Coming back into the cave & being blind vs ... ???
Coming in vs going out - distinction between going in & going out.

Cave - differentiation - you aren't supposed to try to free the prisoners. You're responsible for the city. Not for destroying the hierarchy. For upholding it.

Dialectic - just a word for debate.

Post-modern critique. Debate is horizontal. Only way to resolve justice is to go vertical.

Math
Astrology

1:M (is about up & down?), or, 1:2:3 (same level?)

Light > Darkness is not the same as Darkness > Light
Eyes to see (& disposition to see) (some people are chained to a wall. Disposition is something you have control over??)
Eyes adjust to the sun. The process of going back isn't the same as coming up. (Being able to see vs adjusting to the darkness).


Presupposes a world with NPCs - as though being awake is binary. I'm enlightened or I'm not.


Eyes to see (discernment)
Are you agent smith?
Puppetteers?

Cave - physicality metaphor (1:1).
Cave - there's a limit to senses. Then you have to switch to dialectic (debate).
Island ??

525 D
"Yes, I said, and now having spoken of it, I must add D how charming the science is! and in how many ways it conduces to our desired end, if pursued in the spirit of a philosopher, and not of a shopkeeper!"


Ethan - Pulling the cause outside of the philosopher.
"Pulling the reader out".


Imitation - rene girard's conflict theory & Jesus. Memetic desire.


"Secret sacred self ??"


Universal history - 
Forcing someone to sacrifice is scapegoating.
I'm not strong enough to make a sacrifice. I need others. People need to get a scapegoat & sacrifice it.
Girard equates losing something material with death or something. You do need the loss.


Proper scapegoating - public execution.
Torture to a materialist.
Glory to a Christian.


People will exemplify evil.
Beauty first in discernment, but not in revelation. Or action ?
Hermeneutic of suspicion - caused by ego. Prefers your interpretation of (the world, people's speech - over potential).
Hermeneutic of beauty - ???
Stopped complaining - 
Modern art ??


Satan - relating to the effect, not the cause ??
Idolizing words?? > Dogmatism; not materialism.


OMR - Objective Material Reality
Fully Automated Luxury Gnosticism

That which holds life - like a zombie ?? ...
Memes point down > memeplex
It doesn't point downward.


When you have Luxury, you lose your grounding. When you pursue luxury, that's liberation from limitation (bondage). Bondage is enslavement (if you don't submit). If you submit it's participation in glory, effectively.

If you don't understand the bond, then you can't participate in the glory.
Bondage - demiurge - 

Cancer vs. ?? (something new needs to be integrated.)
Do the new things actually exist.


Satan's cause - rebellion against God.


Acting - channeling of a spirit (faith).
Emergent to god instead of emergent from god.
Then, redemption is not possible.


"Don't go to Satan to play Satan, I go to God to play Satan".
Underground railroad - CIA - recruited him because of his faith. You're gonna need it.


Why are you putting perspectival knowing as a knowledge? That's what the hermeneutics is, effectively.

The symbolism gives you a participatory truth that the professor can't challenge.
Be in the faith to withstand evils.


Forgiveness in your heart.
Things inherit their goodness, not from the action, but from the thing they're participating in.

You go up the mountain, apply a bunch of axioms, and see if it works. If it works, it's true. At least to a certain extent.
