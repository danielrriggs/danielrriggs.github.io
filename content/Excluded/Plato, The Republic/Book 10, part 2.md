603 b - foreshadowing? 
The imitative art is an inferior who marries an inferior, and has inferior offspring.

let us examine further and see 318 C whether the faculty with which poetical imitation is concerned is good or bad.

604b - guy lost his son. Wants to moderate his crying around others. There are two distinct principles.
(under the good-bad dichotomy) The good man follows the guidance of the law, which is patience under such circumstances.

There is no knowing whether such things are good or evil; and nothing is gained by impatience.
> modes of being
> ways of knowing
> just man is like a runner runs in such a way that 
> Apetite - dominant; passions dominant; 

no human Cthing is of serious importance, and grief stands in the way of that which at the moment is most required.

What's not required when fate strikes:
like children, keeping hold of the part struck, wasting time in setting up a howl ... 
- but always accustoming the soul forthwith Dto apply a remedy, raising up that which is sickly and fallen, banishing the cry of sorrow by the healing art.

The rebellious principle
other principle, which inclines us to recollection of our troubles and to lamentation, and can never have enough of them, we may call irrational, useless, and cowardly?

The imitative poet is the one whose art is not intended to affect the rational principle in the soul.
stimulates the passions.
Let's not admit him into the city.
He implants an evil constitution because he indulges the Cirrational nature which has no discernment of greater and less... far removed from the truth.

Like tragedy, comedy
love of comedy can turn man into a bafoon.
the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other affections, of desire and pain and pleasure (606 D).
... poetry feeds the passions.

//// drowned out by strong signals (cognitive overload) > seduced by sister imitation (bind yourself like odysseus )

Blasphemous on the order of South Park
607 - Plato's trolling? Using comedy to say ... 
When someone tells you you should
"take him (Homer) up again and again and get to know him and regulate your whole life according to him, we may love and honour those who say these things—they are excellent people, as far as their lights extend; and we are ready to acknowledge that Homer is the greatest of poets and first of tragedy writers; but we must remain firm in our conviction that hymns to the gods and praises of famous men are the only poetry which ought to be admitted into our State."
Well, we have to allow poetry, but we can't allow poetry other than that to the gods or the praises of great men Because:
"law and the reason of mankind, which by common consent have ever been deemed best".

Poetry is in the space outside of common consent ??
Popular culture is not high culture.

607 - "Let our defense be ... that reason constrained us". We had to do it .... lest "she not impute to us any harshness or want of politeness"


there is an ancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry...:
"the yelping hound howling at her lord"
"mighty in Cthe vain talk of fools"
"the mob of sages circumventing Zeus"
"subtle thinkers who are beggars after all"

We can't let sister imitation in because we cannot betray the truth.
> Reason first in his reasoning; reason captured the telos.
Reason captures the telos.

> Implications - he is explicitly saying we need poetry & philosophy.
> Rationality - subserviant to the gods.

Best book I've ever written, imagery is so clear & rich - in 2 sentences.
1) The building of thought. Unfortunately rare, but I like it. It holds my attention unlike some slow stuff & takes you to positions in which you ask different questions .... should cause you to go ... "huh."
	1) "Huh" - there's a doorway of questioning I could go walk down. I can look at things differently.
He does it by way of rich poetic imagination:
607 E - 
Imagery is rich - 2 sentences. Suppose we banish sister imitation to an island. We elect a guy who likes poetry ad a guy who doesn't to talk to her, let them come back and represent her to us & we'll determine wither sister imitation is useful & not just delightful to the state (they called her charming)."

"(if her defence fails) ... her desires oppose our interests (rationality), ... so too must we after the manner of lovers give her up, though not without a struggle. Poetry is attractive but not true. We too are inspired by that love of poetry which the education 608of noble States has implanted in us,
....
(if her defence suceeds) ... we'll keep it to ourselves, but we won't fall away into the childish love of her which captivates the many".

608 D - soul's immortal. an immortal being should look to the good of the whole.

609 - everything has a good & an evil.
Vice & Evil - that which corrupts & destroys.

(Late last night, 2am - laying in bed listening to some random youtube video on book 10; professor was like 'I find this argument weak'.
609 C - 
"Are there things that destroy the soul?
- Yes - unrighteousness, intemperance, cowardice, ignorance
But does any of these dissolve or destroy her?—and here do not let us fall into the error of supposing that the unjust and foolish man, when he is detected, perishes through his own injustice, which is an evil of the soul".

Say there's some Bad food ...
"the badness of the ; foods themselves introduces the badness of body into the body, which is disease."

To the guy who denys the imortality of the soul -
"When you die, you can't become more evil and unrighteous. If you take that position, than unjustice is to disease. ... (it'll only kill you, which hey maybe tht's not so bad. Puts an end to your suffering. BUT - problem is - ); The nature of evil is such that is murders others and then it survives itself."

610 E - 
Evil is immortal house of death.
Inherent vice (or evil) of the soul.
So, what is vice appointed to destroy?
If the soul's immortal,
611 - reason can't allow for this variance (for example, that the soul has variety and difference and dissimilarity).

The soul's in the eternal space.
The rewards and glories of justice (which come from Homer & Hesiod)
helmet of Hades ??? - 612 B

... remember the just man appears unjust & vice versa?

612 E - 
"the nature both of the just and unjust is truly known to the gods."

"Everything works for the good of the friend of the gods."
"All things work together for those called according to them that love God & are called according to his purpose - Rom 8"

The just man is like a runner who finishes the race & gets a crown. The unjust one finishes but doesn't get a crown.

The unjust do what they want, marry who they want, but in the end, they're miserable, beaten, have their eyes burned out.

There's a judgment day.

10x punishment
1ce per 100 years; therefore ten times in a thousand years.

Tyrant - unforgivable sin. Straight to eternal punishment?
Hades vs Gehena

Spindle of necessity
... blah interval ... blah harmony
Lachesis and Clotho and Atropos
ghost of past, present, & future.

Souls are going up to Lachesis; first they talk to the mediating prophet.

choose your genius

Let If you chose virtue, you'll get more, if you chose vice, you'll get more of that. "God is justified".

Muppet bonanza. Bucket of muppets. All shapes & sizes. Not a pretty sight.

618D - on Wisdom / discernment

learn and discern between good and evil, and so to choose always and everywhere the better life as he has opportunity. He should consider the bearing of all these things which have been mentioned severally and collectively upon virtue; and their relation to the human soul.

he should know what the effect of beauty is when combined with poverty or wealth in a Dparticular soul, and what are the good and evil consequences of noble and humble birth, of private and public station, of strength and weakness, of cleverness and dullness, and of all the natural and acquired gifts of the soul, and the operation of them when conjoined;

evil is that which makes the soul more unjust.

Impulsivity will take you to hell.
... when his life runs its course, he devour his own children.


virtue Dwas a matter of habit only > he had no philosophy.
same for many others.
They had never been schooled by trial.

Souls exchange evil & good decisions.

619 E - does happiness matter?

... plain of Forgetfulness
camp by the river of unmindfulness.

Ambiguous
those who were not saved by wisdom drank more than was necessary; and each one as he drank forgot all things

Ademantus ... Plato makes case for moral absolutes (laying down life for another - universal in all cultures). Hero in Mark's livestream.
Plato made the case for the hero with reason.
No use for the afterlife.
Can't secularize reason.

The proper use of reason recognized the existence of the gods (small g).

The gods (spirits) don't have bodies, so how can they be broken up?

Problem with democracy: shifts to whatever that group of people want.
Hitler passed laws to kill Jews.
