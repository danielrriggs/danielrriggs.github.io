nature and number of the appetites

unnecessary

laws and by reason
	wholly banished or they become few and weak

Sleep
Beast - food; doesn't abstain from intercourse or any food.

Moderate man - not too hungry, not too much food. Temper spirited part.


572 B - 
even in good men, there is a lawless wild-beast nature, which peers out in sleep.


Oligarch > Democratic (dabble moderately in stuff)
Democratic man's son - 
572 E - 
Jowlett - seducers. he is (E) drawn into a perfectly lawless life, which by his seducers is termed perfect liberty;
magicians and 573 tyrant-makers


Bloom - hostility to law, though it is named complete freedom by those who are introducing e him to it,
The enchanters implant a love in him to lead his idle desires (which insist on all available resources being distributed to them).

"Then, when the other desires—overflowing with incense, myrrh, crowns, wines and all the pleasures^ with which such societies are rife—buzz around the drone, making it grow great and fostering it, they plant the sting of longing in it."

sting of desire
this lord of Bthe soul, having Madness for the captain of his guard.

**Madness**
573 B - The mad man puts an end to better principles
Sweeny Todd - 
Sleep No More - MacBeth

Drunkenness - tyrannic turn of mind

573 c - "the man who is mad and deranged undertakes and expects to be able to rule not only over human beings but gods, too."

"drunken, erotic, and melancholic."

Goaded on by love & desire.
frenzy

574 C - explicit sarcasm

what's this about love? bodyguard of love ??

"assisted by the infatuation of the people,"
The movement is in the class of people, and then they choose from among themselves the one who has most of the tyrant in his own soul.
It seems to be described bottom up and not top down.

the worst man: he is the waking reality of what we dreamed.

Like men, like state
Proof one - which state / man is most virtuous?
How do they stand as to virtue? We need to judge with good judgment. Let's assume that's us.

he who is ill-governed in his own person.
He has to be master of others when he is not master of himself; like a sick man who is compelled to be an athlete.

579 - He who is the real tyrant, whatever men may think, is the real slave, and is obliged to practise the greatest adulation Eand servility, and to be the flatterer of the vilest of mankind.

Fragility of a society - 

3 principles of the soul - rational, spirited, appetitive.

Appetitive - $ loving, gaining.
Spirited - mastery, victory and good reputation; victory-loving, and honor-loving,.
rational - learning-loving and wisdom-loving
a.k.a. reason, passion, desire.

Ask the 3 of them what's most pleasurable? They dispute with one another.
Lover of wisdom relation to lover of gain. Lover of wisdom experienced gain as a child, but the lover of gain may not have ever experienced the love of Wisdom.

Lover of Wisdom relation to Lover of honor.
They all experienced honor.
Gain - honored by the many.
 the delight which is to be found 294 in the knowledge of true being is known to the philosopher only.

The only inference possible, he replied, is that pleasures which are approved by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest.

And so we arrive at the result, that the pleasure of the 583 intelligent part of the soul is the pleasantest of the three, and that he of us in whom this is the ruling principle has the pleasantest life.

Sounds like he's mocking philosophy (because of how they arbitrarily elected themselves as judges).

583 - Unquestionably, he said, the wise man speaks with authority when he approves of his own life.

Weak justification ???

End of Trial 2

confusion of pleasure & pain

585 - 
The inferiority of the body pleasures.
The pleasure of knowledge is better than the pleasure from satisfying hunger / thirst.
The invariable and immortal has a more real existence than the variable and mortal, and has a corresponding measure of knowledge and truth.
The soul, again, has more existence and truth and knowledge than the body.
The body pleasures are mere shadows of pleasure, mixed with pain, coloured and intensified by contrast, and therefore intensely desired.

There is in nature an upper, lower, and middle region, and he who passes from the lower to the middle imagines that he is going up and is already in the upper world; and if he were taken back again would think, and truly think, that he was descending. All this arises out of his ignorance of the true upper, middle, and lower regions. And a like confusion happens with pleasure and pain, and with many other things. [585](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55201/55201-h/55201-h.htm#stpage585A)The man who compares grey with black, calls grey white; and the man who compares absence of pain with pain, calls the absence of pain pleasure. Again, hunger and thirst are inanitions of the body, ignorance and folly of the soul; and food is the satisfaction of the one, knowledge of the other. Now which is the purer satisfaction—that of eating and drinking, or that of knowledge?

Spirited inferior
The desires of love and tyranny are the farthest from law, and those of the king are nearest to it.

589 - multitudinous beast. Not united ? Unjust guy is feeding the beast & not strengthening (starving) the man.

591 - 
‘What, then, shall a man profit, if he gain the whole world’ and become more and more wicked? Or what shall he profit by escaping discovery, if the concealment of evil prevents the cure?

Balanced guy - lives by the image of the perfect city; doesn't matter if it ever exists.
He'll never be a politiican.
I understand; you mean that he will be a ruler in the city of which we are the founders, and which exists in idea only; Bf or I do not believe that there is such an one anywhere on earth?

In heaven, I replied, there is laid up a pattern of it, methinks, which he who desires may behold, and beholding, may set his own house in order[4](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55201/55201-h/55201-h.htm#Footnotebook94). But whether such an one exists, or ever will exist in fact, is no matter; for he will live after the manner of that city, having nothing to do with any other.

Take notes while listening.
Do not interpret in real time.
