Anadromist:
How We Got Here Ep4: Changes in morals, meaning, and manners.
70's Me Generation
You don't define yourself.
Meaning suffers.


576D
- "Then comparing our original city, which was under a king, and the city which is under a tyrant, how do they stand as to virtue?"

Intentions from 
Manuel - Be unstructured
Mark - See what's happening (in the text; see others' interpretations)
Danny - meditate on Madness
Ethan - recognize patterns in the modern world

intimacy

Plato & Yoga
The Somatic Experience

577 D/E - the tyrant has no volition (can't act voluntarily) (option, not obligation). Debt service is not optional. Ex: servicing a lie - not in optional space (or at least, I will suffer consequences if I tell the truth). I don't know what the consequences of telling the truth are. But a virtuous person submits themselves to something higher when they resolve to act with conviction irrespective of outcome. Can't dabble either - like democratical man - sometimes is idle, sometimes goes to gym, sometimes does philosophy.

Tyrant soul: Poor, fear, miserable, lustful, dainty, greedy

The public tyran't can't travel around the city. Lives hidden.
Intimacy.
Gratitude - casting life in a positive valence.
Small YT channel - Samuel Loncar - Made a video called "How philosophy saved my life video".
Philosophy is about caring enough about yourself such that you're willing to do whatever it takes to live the best life.


Your pursuit shouldn't be toward agency, should be toward virtue.
Best life - virtuous one; most abundant; most powerful; most pleasurable.
Renunciation of career ambitions.
	Eyes to see opportunity?
	The time given to me preexisted.
	What changes: the object of the pleasure.
	I woke up this morning; I don't have cancer.


579 D - master others but can't master himself.

580 - cherishing vices will make you miserable.
B - Proof One -
Criteria: virtue and vice, happiness and misery.
Like man like city (miserable over self = tyrant of city).

Plato is funny - 
And shall I add, ‘whether seen or unseen by gods and men’?
Let the words be added.

580 D - Second proof: nature of the soul
Aim of the head, heart, & belly.
The target of the lower motivations are less virtuous. Hunger is ceased.
Lovers of Wisdom, Honor, & Gain.

Contentious: What about an honor loving God?
Not all deities demand worship.
What's the essence of worship? Sacrifice? Can you worship without paying a price?

To the $ maker, learning is vanity.

They're saying the philosopher only has the power to judge because he values essential truth & acknowledges the necessity of the lower pleasures (581 E - the philosopher has the lower appetites, too).

582 E - reason is his instrument.

583 B - third trial - the pleasure of the wise is true & pure; the others are a shadow only.
Pleasure - pain; trick of the triangle (neutral position). Third position grenade.
Hot - cold - lukewarm. Are you for me or are you against me? Neither. That's inconvenient for your categorization & labeling.
Math - multidimensional problems.

Binary subversion
Sick > healthy (pain to pleasure).
Healthy > sick (pleasure to pain).
What about Neutral? Can't you go from neutral to either pleasure or pain? (583 E).
583 E - pleasure and pain are motions of the soul.
"I'm Non-binary; thus creating a binary system, making you binary again." 

They don't mean what they are actually saying.
Identifying against - normativity.
You're actually trying to capture the frame by force, or by your own authority. You're just saying "I reject the values of the normative position." But that sounds aggressive, so by saying I'm non-binary, you cast as a marginal victim if anyone ever attacks you for it. But in reality, you were the one who shot first.

Binaries create relative positions.

584 D - lower to middle region, then get stuck there.
(Some pleasures are less real).
Going from an alcoholic to being career obsessed or something.

Ignorance & folly are to the soul as hunger & thirst are to the body (585 B).
Essence of the invariable are more real.

Soul > more truth & essence than the body.
