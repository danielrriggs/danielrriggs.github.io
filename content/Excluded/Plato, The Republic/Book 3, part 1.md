Summary

Poetry
In the Odyssey, Odysseus meets Achilles in the Underworld. Achilles tells Odysseus he would rather be a serf on the land of a poor man than rule over all the dead. Socrates argues this will cultivate fear of death in the minds of the young men who read the Odyssey.
	We need people to choose death in battle, rather than defeat in slavery.


Poets portrayal of the gods.
Full on tyrany - 
- Socrates portrays the gods as capricious, cruel, and petty.
- Socrates view??: The example of the gods sets the virtues, and then provides justification for the actions of men.
	- Immitation ("The memetic arts")
- Music & style correspond
- **Music** is a way for us to train
	- Phrygian Mode Patterns
	- Dorian Mode Patterns
		- These are similar to the modern natural minor scale.
		- "There complexity engendered license, and here disease; whereas **simplicity** in music was the parent of temperance in the soul; and simplicity in gymnastic of health in the body."
	- He considers these 2 Modes to cultivate courage in times of war & temperance in times of peace


- Art
	- "We would not have our guardians grow up amid images of moral deformity" .... because that'll corrupt their soul .... "Let our artists rather be those who are gifted to discern the true nature of the beautiful and graceful; then will our youth dwell in a land of health, amid fair sights and sounds, and receive the good in everything; and beauty, the effluence of fair works, shall flow into the eye and ear, like a health-giving breeze from a purer region, and insensibly draw the soul from earliest years into likeness and sympathy with the beauty of reason."


- Physical Training
	- "Not that the good body by any bodily excellence improves the soul, but, on the contrary, that the good soul, by her own excellence, improves the body as far as this may be possible."
		- // The proper way to train the body is through the mind?
		- A Guardian shouldn't be intoxicated ... why?? What about the merits of intoxication?
		- They gotta roast their meat; can't boil b/c guardians don't have capacity for carrying pots & pans. No sicilian cookery!
		- No Corinthain girls as a fair friend.


Misc
- "When intemperance and disease multiply in a State" ... it increases demand for doctors & lawyers ("justice").
	- "And yet what greater proof can there be of a bad and disgraceful state of education than this, that not only artisans and the meaner sort of people need the skill of first-rate physicians and judges, but also those who would profess to have had a liberal education?"
- Law nerd - I'm a top lawyer. I pride myself in litigiousness... "and all for what?--in order to gain small points not worth mentioning, he not knowing that so to order his life as to be able to do without a napping judge is a far higher and nobler sort of thing". Scathing criticism of aiming at law???
- It's a discrace that men become sick by by indolence and a habit of life... we didn't used to have these weird diseases back in the days of Asclepius.
- (pg 87) excessive care of the body is most inimical to the practice of virtue.
	- It's incompatible with the management of a house, an army, or an office of state; and, what is most important of all, irreconcilable with any kind of study or thought or self-reflection
- Eugenics
	- "...He (Asclepius) did not want to lengthen out good-for-nothing lives, or to have weak fathers begetting weaker sons;--if a man was not able to live in the ordinary way he had no business to cure him; for such a cure would have been of no use either to himself, or to the State."
- // If you're so rich, why aren't you more virtuous?
- Ex of some rich people whose lives are of no use to anyone
	- Unhealth and intemperance
- The most skilful physicians ... have combined with the knowledge of their art the greatest experience of disease; they had better not be robust in health, and should have had all manner of diseases in their own persons. For the body, as I conceive, is not the instrument with which they cure the body; in that case we could not allow them ever to be or to have been sickly; but they cure the body with the mind, and the mind which has become and is sick can cure nothing.
- However, for the judge, knowledge should be his guide, not personal experience.
	- "honourable mind which is to form a healthy judgment should have had no experience or contamination of evil habits when young"
	- The dishonest man cannot recognize an honest man because he has no pattern of honesty in himself.
	- Vice cannot know virtue too, but a virtuous nature, educated by time, will acquire a knowledge both of virtue and vice: the virtuous, and not the vicious, man has wisdom--in my opinion.
- And thus our youth, having been educated only in that simple music which, as we said, inspires temperance, will be reluctant to go to law.
- The simple musician & common athlete...
	- The very exercises and tolls which he undergoes are intended to stimulate the spirited element of his nature
	- the teachers of both have in view chiefly the improvement of the soul
- Too much gym -> too hard. Too much music -> too effeminite
	- Take this spirit of ferocity & rightly educate it > would produce courage. If you overshoot, you'll become hard & brutal.
- The harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous
- inharmonious is cowardly and boorish


It's like a build your religion (example of the noble lie?)
- Origin of life
- gives purpose
- gives feelings of fellowship.
- The society's health & security of the state elevated over truth
