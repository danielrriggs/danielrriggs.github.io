This morning, I wrote up / stole / stitched together a summary of Ch 1 - 

**Book 1 Summary**

- Introduction to Cephelas, an old rich guy
	- Passions relax in old age. Experience calmness; freedom.
	- Advantages of weath: I don't need to deceive another man; In younger years, fear of punishment in the afterlife was a laughing matter; later in life, it's a more serious issue.
- Cephelas' Justice - **Justice is paying debts & telling the truth**.
	- Refutation: Socrates shows several instances where it isn't Just to repay one's debts.
		- Such as returning guns to a mad friend. Or, if my mad friend asks me where -Dave- is so he may kill Dave.


- (Cephelas' son) Polemarchus' Justice - **Justice is doing good to friends, evil to enemies.**
	- Refutation: The just man never does evil, even to his enemies.
		When something inflicts harm on a horse, the horse deteriorates in the excellence of a horse.
		Similarly, to injure a man is to deteriorate his excellence, which is Justice.
		 A horseman, by his art, cannot injure a horse, nor can a musician by his art, make men un-musical. Similarly, a just man, by justice, cannot make another man unjust. Thus, only unjust men injure other men. To do evil is never just.


- Thrasymachus' Justice - **Justice is to the advantage of the stronger.**
	- Tyrany, democracy, aristocracy - make laws to their own interest. These laws **are** the Justice which they deliver to their citizens. 
		- Violators of the law are unjust. Because government has power to make (& enforce??) the laws, it is the stronger.
	- Refutation:
		- Rulers are not infallable. They pass laws that aren't in their best interest.
		- Some laws encourage citizens to behave contrary to the interest of the stronger. If Justice is merely obeying the laws, it isn't always in the interest of the stronger.
			- Is a mathemetician a mathemitician when he makes a mistake? Or, is he not a mathemeticial at that point in time?
			- Every art has an interest (which is the arts' subject, not the art itself). Medicine, the patient. Horsemanship, the horse. No art is concerned with its own interest, because it has none. No physician considers his own good in his prescriptions, but considers the patient. Thus, the ruler makes laws in the interest in the ruled, not to himself. Therefore, people must be paid to rule, because they're passing laws in the interest of their subjects, not themselves.
				- Each art gives us something good. Medicine good health; navigation safety on the seas; payment, money.
					- We don't confuse the art of navigation with the art of medicine just because one becomes healthy on a sea voyage.
				- Societal payments: money, honor, or punishment.
					- Men with less avarice rule by payment of punshment, else less just men then them rule.
	- Thrasymachus: The Unjust man is happier than the Just man. The Just man is miserable, the Unjust happier. Therefore, injustice is more advantageous than justice.
		- Socrates: Justice is wisdom & virtue, while Injustice is ignorance & vice.
			- Mathmetician Analogy: a Mathemetician doesn't desire to be more than a mathemetician (yet wants to become more knowladgeable on Math than a non-mathemetician), so to does the Just man not desire more than the Just, but does desire more than the UnJust. Likewise, the man ignorant of Math desires more than the mathemetician AND the non-mathemeticians. Just as the unjust man desires more than both the Just & UnJust.
		- Because Justince is Wisdon & Virtue, it is stronger than injustice, which is ignorance.


- Socrates: The unjust are incapable of common action. A group of thieves must behave justly if they wish to conspire. If they were truly unjust, they would inflict evil upon one another, & would not be able to work towards a common cause. Injustice renders an individual incapable of action because of internal disorder.
- Everything has an end, and an excellence. The end of the eye, sight; the ear, hearing; the soul, happiness.
	- If the eye's excellence deteriorates, the eye is incapable of achieving its particular end.
	- If the soul's excellence deteriorates, it won't be capable of achieving its' end, happiness.
- At the end of Book 1, Socrates says that we don't yet have a good description of Justice, but have only identified a few superficial attributes & consequences of behaving Justly.


The Just man never does evil, even to his enemies.


What I don't care for
- The politicial philosophy or actual corrolaries from wherever you end up propisitionally.
- I start with the individual, then think about family, then job, then close friends, and it doesn't really go much beyond that.


**What I thought was cool**
- Category bending
- Normally, I have to be pulled out of Mechanistic thinking, but when reading this book, it's like I was able to jump out of it.


Want to explore
- "True" Pilot.
- -What you think- vs ... ??

Excellence
**The end** of the eye is sight because you can't see without it?
Art

If something inflicts harm on a horse, the horse deteriorates in its excellence.

Train reciprocity
To gain proficiency where I don't have proficiency.

Monster - 
The Beast - mid
The Man - (Rationality)

Waiting for Goudou - the guy ruled by passion, intellect, pragmatism; the slave - the most beautiful character in the story.

All about relationship. Heart is supported (not overruled) by the man. The heart will turn away from the head.

Why might you be interested? Now I can fulfil this deep need in me.
Or: I am doing this already, now I see a place for what you're handing me, & therefore I'm interested.



I am here because I found the book to be engaging, cool, totally captivated
got a feeling like there's lots of cool stuff that & I feel that I was only able to see like 5% of it.
I've 
- Hoping to connect real life with you guys.
- I'm too exhausted in my day to day life to participate 
I want to learn from the group
