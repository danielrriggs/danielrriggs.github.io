- Ordering of things

Won't the guardians become disgruntled since their lifestyle's so restrictive?
Let's explore that.

State's set up for the good of the whole (utilitarian stance)

"beautify the eyes to such a degree that they are no longer eyes"
gotta keep proper proportions.
The husbandman can get swagged out ... lay around

How to prevent the categories from bluring into one another? What's the distinction?

Citizens living for revelry, but the guardians for duty. If happiness isn't even a thing, then we'll need to compell the guardians. In the name of nobility of the state.

2 things deteriorate the arts - wealth & poverty.

Going to war ... like the I brought more men than you scene from 300.
"Who, on hearing these words, would choose to fight against lean wiry dogs, rather th than, with the dogs on their side, against fat and tender sheep?"

Divide the city into - the rich & the poor.

What if our State is poor & has to fight many rich states?

What if our State becomes rich & formes alliances (via deed & truth rather than in reputation or appearances)? We could keep our military small. Then we could fight armies bigger than us.

How do we limit the boundaries of the State?
- Until it's no longer consistent with **unity**

on Education (pg 100)
music and gymnastic be preserved in their original form, and no innovation made.

The foundation of the fortress must be made in music.

lawlessness creeps in in the form of amusement. It first appears harmless, but then the spirit of license finds a home & penetrates into manners and customs. It invades contracts between men, then goes onto laws and constitutions. Ending in an overthrow of all rights, public & private.

By the help of music, the gain the habit of order ... and therefore respect their elders.
But, we can't legislate respecting the elders (it won't stick).

The education will determine a person's life (7 years).
pv 22:6 - Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it.


on **legislation**
On regulating the business of the marketplace ... it'll emerge.
We can't legislate every little thing ... but intemperence & licensiousness will mess it all up!


If God will only preserve to them the laws which we have given them
...
w/o divine help, people will seek attaining perfection.

You would compare them, I said, to those invalids who, having no self-restraint, will not leave off their habits of **intemperance**?

What about the other states? Can't alter the constitution, but skilled people who can appeal to the rulers can manipulate them.
Then you get ... the **applause of the multitude** ... **deluding** people into thinking they're really a statesman (but they're just a puppet ... the mouthpiece of the crowd).

Most important thing to protect ... The institution of temples and sacrifices.

But where, amid all this, is justice? Let's go try to find it.
Kind of like designing a simulation & then seeing what emerges.
