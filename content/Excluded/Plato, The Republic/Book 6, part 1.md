Allegory of the Sun - the Form of the Good - source of knowledge.

Ways to separate something
	1 vessel from ???


Form of the good - 
Physical realm - objects & images.
Lower realm & intelligible realm. Socrates thinks the intelligible realm exists independently of the physical realm.
Lower realm - definitions of beauty, courage, and justice.

The empiricists think that the Abstract concepts are derived from physical concepts.


Manuel - spirit vs flesh.
Game in bible study - 
"voice of God" - that which speaks the word of God in the words. You're separating the words from the person who's speaking them.

"We're Christians', we're going extinct. Need to prepare for the big bad predator - framing everything in the secular ??? reciprocally narrowed on that."
You have to go back to ... Why are you a Christian? How is the bible helping you?
We need to know the text... & know the context.
Manuel on the Prayer thing: You look for a context that's your life. Then you look for the text, then you use the text in prayer.
How do you know you aren't projecting on the context?
Prayer - conforming to the world?
"Semblence of how the world works. I'm going to believe what the bible says ... I'm going to indoctrinate myself ... w/y prayer?".
"I wanna see ... I wanna see... No, you see by fruit. Walk by faith, not by sight".

Error: "Emergence is good".
Things are united in the one. Then, they get their identity in the union.
What's an identity, or a name? This is how identities are used. It's the thing by which you are known. Therefore it holds a certain authority.
The name of Jesus only holds the authority with which you have a relationship with it. The meaning is a consequence of a relationship. That's knowing. It's being informed by. Or, having conformed to (Jesus).
Jesus is sorting the hierarchy below him. He's the source of relevance.
If you have a frame, now you can name things within the frame.

The frame is what allows for names.
What allows us to make frames?

Jesus is the justification for frames. He's the name above all names.

In order for a cup to be a cup, I need a frame of cupness.
The cupness comes from need. Need for subsistence. Which comes from living out our purpose(s).
... dialectic

Seeds ... like archetypes.
... sub natures ... personality types ??
Spiritual gifts ... The Chakras.
... I still need to resolve ... ?? what issue ??

Lacking in wholeness (in integration)? That's the most important thing > that you're integrated.

"Role of the queen > to invite a prophet > what's it mean to invite an alien prophet?"
There's the kingdom. Then there's something higher.
You renounce the principle (of your kingdom ?) for a higher principle.

Prayer is a lifestyle. God isn't a vending machine.

Integration
Wholeness
Not lacking in conflict (co-equals).

Optimistic thing - maybe there's actual value in correcting my attention

Enough seemed to have been said.’ Enough, my friend; but what is enough while anything remains wanting? Of all men the guardian must not faint in the search after truth; he must be prepared to take the longer road, or he will never reach that higher region which is above the four virtues; and of the virtues too he must not only get an outline, but a clear and distinct vision. (Strange that we should be so precise about trifles, so careless about the highest truths!) ‘And what are the highest?’ [505](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55201/55201-h/55201-h.htm#stpage505A)You to pretend unconsciousness, when you have so often heard me speak of the idea of good, about which we know so little, and without which though a man gain the world he has no profit of it.
...
You remember our old distinction of the many beautiful and the one beautiful, the particular and the universal, the objects of sight and the objects of thought? Did you ever consider that the objects of sight imply a faculty of sight which is the most complex and costly of our senses, requiring not only objects of sense, but also a medium, which is light; without which the sight will not distinguish between colours and all will be a blank (506).

This eye of the day or sun is what I call the child of the good, standing in the same relation to the visible world as the good to the intellectual.
(affordances necessary to make frames)

dialectic ???
...

Imagine a sphere. Below is shadows and image. Above are the real objects. Need the minds eye.

"you mean that the ideas of science are superior to the hypothetical, metaphorical conceptions of geometry and the other arts or sciences, whichever is to be the name of them"

Faculties.
Affordances required to do science.

Notes

Tells a parable where a crew mutiny's its captain. ('they have a theory that it can't be learned' > sci-fi axiom, obviously). ('The art of piloting. Obviously, the procedures of piloting can be learned. What's this mean on education?)
The mutinous crew doesn't know the art of piloting.
The captain is the philosopher in the parable.

People are like seeds. When the nature falls upon soil

"Think of all this and ask yourself whether the world is more likely to be a believer in the unity of the idea, or in the multiplicity of phenomena" - above 494.

Love of knowledge diverts him

The education of the guardians - we agreed they loved their country ... yada (starting point).
They must be guardians.
But the trait stack is rare (intelligence, temperance, courage, memory. Ability to exact).

"of the virtues too he must not only get an outline, but a clear and distinct vision"

Around 504 is interesting.
