585 D - 
The classes that have to do with the care of the body participate less in truth and being than those having to do with the care of the soul

What's the point of caring for the body? Apart from minimum maintenance.

Inscape is flexible in that it encapsulates many teleologies.
Poetic forms of information train attention. The filters you look at the world through are really important.
// For some reason when I think of a form I think of perfection & good thoughts, but inscape is way darker. Like I can turn the tree into a trebuchet & use it to kill my enemies.

Without calculation & intelligence.

Why intention matters.

Law & argument - closer to true pleasure.
(What's most distant from Law & Order?)
King's life is 729 times more pleasant than the tyrant.

It's called ChatGPT, not Deep Thought.
We literally have Deep Thought (supercomputer from hitchhikers guide to the galaxy) which gives answers such as "42" to questions like "what's the meaning of life, the universe, and everything?"

Cult of AI.

Book 10

Words convey more than they signify.

Poverty of math is that they don't convey any more than they signify.
Viewing the world as a composition of functions is a sad and impoverished view. Over emphasis on the mechanical.
Dante says love moves things.

Differences and perspective don't mean the real thing is different. They are just differences of appearance..

Plato's making fun of the one who's able to analyze the nature of knowledge and have superior knowledge of every art. That's smarty pants.

The content of the poetry is not where the meaning is. The content of the poetry is not what is it's essence is. It does not the important part of it. The point is not to describe in propositional terms what the poets is trying to convey. It isn't eligible to be grasped by one person in a superior way.

A painting can be more real than real though. More real than a photograph. (Because of what it conveys).

I think of the inconceivable scene from princess Bride. When Plato talks about that simple creature, who knows it all.

The know-it-all is missing the important aspect of knowledge because knowledge is not to be possessed and hoarded. Who cares if you hoard a bunch of facts. We have machines to do that now.

Did Homer actually achieve success in waging? A real war? No, he didn't. He's just talking about it.
Patilis is to make man virtuous. If Homer had real knowledge it would make man virtuous and what have been popular. But it's the virtue that's the target and the popularity.

He wants to be the theme of the work because it has more honor and profit. He doesn't actually want to produce works. So the form of his behavior contradicts purity or violate. Purity the essence or spirit of the thing is not what's most elevated if profit is what you're after. For the imitative guy.


J Pageau - Plato said get rid of those artists because they can make us think something is beautiful when it isn't. They're tricksters.
They're like Cain. They bring about the Flood.
