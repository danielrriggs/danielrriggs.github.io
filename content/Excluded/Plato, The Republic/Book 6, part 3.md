Ancient Greece Declassified ??.
1st half mirrors the last half.


Buzzani - (projecting back - our impression of the thing isn't really the thing).
Anatomy of the cave.


Intentions
Manuel - why things get introduced. Observe things by the sphere of influence.
Danny - Understand Plato's mind ( Faith ?? ).


Looking at why they got to the forms.


501 B - image of man (form of God).
Building a state | purpose of exploring a man who bears its image.
Then, we can talk about the Child of the good (they didn't say father of the).


Plato - faith in rationality. Grounded in Hellenistic ?? ... control over the passions.
Corruption of the philosophers. Pessimistic.
Rationality w/ ability to notice intelligibility.
Intelligibility (set of thoughts; way of thinking). The intelligibility of the object isn't in the object.


Rationality - that which convicts you ??
**Intelligibility** - **imposes** itself upon you.
Laws enacted ... not enforced.
Dogma's also not enforced.
Laws point the way.


???
The Sun is a visible object that makes objects visible to the eye through the power of sight by providing light.
The Good is an intelligible object that makes objects intelligible to the soul through the power of understanding by providing truth.

The Sun is responsible for generation, nurture, & growth. It's also responsible
Generative
The force of generativeness.
It's the source, but it's not the thing.


?? Eyes up vs eyes down ?? ...
In the divided line.
The shadow of the principle. It's in with alot of other details.

Imagination > Belief > Thought > Understanding
Imaginary > Physical (senses) > world of ideas > back to help.
Imagining > Common sense belief > thinking > Dialectic (intelligence / knowledge??)
Conjecture > Belief > Understanding > Exercise of reason


The source of light ... the cleanliness of vision (fire vs the Sun). There are different points of light. The quality matter. Perspective matters. Framing actually matters. It's the complete opposition to the post moderns.


Ethan - limits to dialectic. "Don't desert us".
Word Games
Early Book 8 - x, y, z
	He answers rhetorical questions for other people, explicitly - "Shall I answer for you?".
		Not objective; bias.
He's creating an Idyllic myth.
The dialectic has a Telos.


Dialectic - is disenchantment.


Interesting in the advancement of his thought.
The quality of his words enchanted the reading.


Curious - reciprocal opening. It's an affordance.
If something is imposed from above
Need curiosity (there are lots of aspects to the ability to be opened). Wonder. Ability & willingness to go outside the box.
The ones in the cave aren't shackled. Ignorance?
Is this reality? What's the nature of reality?


Nature - that which grounds the person.
What is nature?
How do you ground yourself?
Identity is negotiated.


The Form of the ??
The Mind - informed by intelligences
The Heart - informed by the things that seem good
The Gut - eat what you want.
Bowls being the seed of the spirit.
3 loves as well (Greek loves).


Obligation - 
Good is the highest form because it grants use to all else (Utilitarian frame). Things can only be of use towards a purpose.

Virtues & Soul

505ish
Knowledge.
Need the Good or knowledge isn't ?? ... what appears to be knowledge isn't knowledge unless it's embedded in the Good. It's the shadow of knowledge.
(Peterson) Science is embedded in a narrative. ??? Create demiurge from here.
Can conceive of good through knowledge of the good.
They have to say the knowledge is inherently good (gnostic aspect). If you can't explain where the knowledge is coming from, how can it be good?
If you follow pleasure, bad & good are the same.


Computational explosion - where's your knowledge come from?
Not resolvable in the intelligible realm because ... too much data ??
- Corruption - politician wants to sponsor your research.
- Aren't curious
- Bad memory
Futility - reciprocally narrowing (small box).


2 ethics: Knowledge & Pleasure. Hedonism & Gnosticism.

Unifying principle (idea is the form).
The Many are seen but not known.
Ideas are known but not seen.


509
The Lord of Light - the sun
The ?? the ?? the Sun
The Sun is the author of sight that is recognized by sight.


The good emanates onto you.
The Sun is the master of Truth & Reason.
The source of light (walk by sight).
The Universal cause of all that is right & beautiful?
Truth & Reason must serve a master.


Book 6, 475 D
curiosity makes a philosopher?
**imitation**
Who are the true philosophers?
Corruption
The whole of Book 6 - all about the pretend philosopher. It's why the public hates philosophy & thinks it's useless.
Just soul notion?


More than one light.
The soul is like the eye, resting upon that on which truth & being shine. Something that's shown by truth & being.
Soul - capacity to wrestle w/ the intellect.
If turned towards twilight (not a proper source of light), there's no lasting nature. You can't discern that which points to the eternal; therefore there's no intelligence.
If ?? ... therefore, no intelligence.
Intelligibility is that which lasts through time.
If you don't participate properly. If there's twilight.
"Affordance" - not relating to the emanation. You're relating to an implementation of it. 15 ways of describing generative.


Constraint from below emerged.
Constraints from above (in this case from the state).
Your identities are determined by those constraints + your free will.


Peterson says identity is a negotiation.
(on nature) - identity & containers.
Gnostic - have more curiosity, ambition, work harder, make more of yourself.
Why do you have to say it?
Why should I have to tell anyone I care? It should be obvious. Caring is an action. They just need to experience it. If you do need to say it, something's wrong.
(Love Languages - someone else's expression of value). Care can't be an adjective. Virtue signaling. Virtues don't make sense if any solid form. Because they're the thing everything else is built upon. If you say you have a virtue - wrong ?
My internet connection isn't something I have; it's something I participate with. It has to transfer something. It's not static. Not a noun. Not an object.

We mistake the understanding of a thing for its possession.

Good source of Truth when constrained by knowledge.
Science & Truth are images of the Good. Wrt knowledge only.
You can see an image of truth wrt knowledge.


Observing what I missed & why.
- Multiple fires
- Mapping language
	- "Understanding"


The ?? of the true, the good, the beautiful is science. Science doesn't contain the
Identity is negotiated (not something I decide in my head).


The Good has a higher place of honor
The copy ?? ... opinion ... > to knowledge. Twilight.
509 B
The object has form - not the same form as we're talking about w/ Idas. It's not forming. It's informing.
"King of Kings"
516 C - cause of all things ... we aren't the philosopher kings.
	Flaw of the idea (which is perfect in its form) still doesn't work because he can't pick a successor.
The divided line says things spread out.
Opaque - source isn't visible. Still not happening according to the source.


How do I get beyond hypothesis?
	(stop thinking, go do something?)


"Beyond hypothesis".
Hypothesis of hypotheses.


Sphere of the intellectual.
Principles that lead to ideals. Above the line. Where the hypothesis leads up in clarity. On the other side, you have a figure that leads to an image, where the hypothesis leads down. Reduces in clarity.
?? Fallen angels ... vs rising angels.
	(Math) trains you to think abstractly.
	Starting hypothesis in math ... relate to ideals behind. Reasoning is not around the visible forms, but the forms resemble ideals. When looking at the ideals ... they make ?? to the ...


Book 7
Guardian master dialectic to grasp the good ??


People - sensory relation to the world
Puppeteers - narrative sources?
Fire - // Buzzani - scripture - take care not to ?? your light to ?? darkness. Just chasing the passions.

Problems with the cave
1) The Cave doesn't exist
2) Who are the puppeteers? What's keeping that conspiracy going?
3) Fire vs Sun


Wrong interpretation? (can we do better?):
This metaphor is meant to illustrate the effects of education on the human soul. Education moves the philosopher through the stages on the divided line, and ultimately brings him to the Form of the Good.


Why would you make that?
	Emanation vs emergence.


Nature
First Principle
(Clearness; Simplicity).
"Know if they relate to principles".

	Shadow - a definition of beauty, justice, courage, etc.
	Physical object - symbolize beauty, justice, courage, etc.

Is light enlightenment & darkness ignorance?
What about ignorance is bliss? Why's it have to be dark? The chicken crossed the road because it was better on the other side.
What about the Sun?? ...
Question what's real? More suspicion?

Sentence 1
"ANDÂ now, I said, let me show in a figure how far our nature is enlightened or unenlightened"
517 B Paragraph - 

Mathematical sciences join Plato's educational curriculum only so far as they remain fixed on the proper goal: the ascertainment of being and not becoming

521 D
"What sort of knowledge is there which would draw the soul from becoming to being?"


The eye is to light as the soul is to Good.
"First Principle" - go w/ Math.
