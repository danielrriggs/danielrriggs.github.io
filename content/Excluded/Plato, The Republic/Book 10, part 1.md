Thick irony

Book 9 - carnal pleasures - if you don't have the life experience to understand the intrinsic pleasure of the higher parts, then you don't get it.
If you have to ask the question then you don't get it. Only the unjust person asks the question.

You can't justify justice to unjust people. They will kill you before you do that.

I have worked with many people like this. Undeveloped in important ways, overemphasizing less important things. I witnessed those people lie, bully, use force in negotiations (we'll hire the contractors with no reputation because they'll be forced to perform well). Lots of withholding of payment.

Why some past times are better than others. Instrument, gym, maybe reading, video games.

Imitativeness is a problem with the form of the art, not the content of the art.

Ask Homer which battle he won - what does he know about courage? Sophacles was a general. Plato is cherry picking, and you're supposed to know that. There were lots of poets that were generals.

Tragedy - shows people coming apart in their most challenging moments. They're lamenting that the appetitive part of them is ?? ... They've encountered a stress that 

Trajedy is rehearsing death.

Is the soul immortal? ... substance dualism ?? ...

If harm to the body doesn't harm the soul, it seems that destruction to the body doesn't destroy the soul.
You can suffer great bodily harm & still keep the soul in order.

Soul - oneness of the person. When it is in the form of the good, it is incorruptible.

When your Soul is ordered in a just way, it's stable.
Badass idea of immortality - 
Whatever circumstances you face, you can face it without falling apart. The soul gives you stability.

The myth of Er... the noble lie returns. We're the objects of his educative efforts. He's been educating us. He says, "remember, we tell good lies about the afterlife." You aren't supposed to take this literally.

End of Phato - Plato says only a fool would insist on the truth of this, but we have something to learn from it.


Chat GPT said what the words say & literally didn't even mention the myth of Er.

River of forgetfulness.

....

596 - Whenever a number of individuals have a common name, we assume them to have also a corresponding idea or form.

The power of a **name** (identity). (Poetry helps with the things that don't have names??)
The name of Jesus only holds the authority with which you have a relationship with it. The meaning is a consequence of a relationship. That's knowing. It's being informed by. Or, having conformed to (Jesus).
Jesus is sorting the hierarchy below him. He's the source of relevance.

If you have a frame, now you can name things within the frame.
The frame is what allows for names.
What allows us to make frames?

Jesus is the justification for frames. He's the name above all names.

In order for a cup to be a cup, I need a frame of cupness.
The cupness comes from need. Need for subsistence. Which comes from living out our purpose(s).
Identity isn't something I say about myself. If it' true, you have to back it up with actions. I'm a programmer because I actually have a track record of doing the real thing in the real world under extremely difficult circumstances. 

Being seasoned. Enduring hell. Keeping cool in Mission Impossible. Having experience in a death march program can make you a leader. Learn how to behave in a way that gives the team the best possible shot at success, or at least failing as successfully as you can.


(workplace) Brand - when people say your name, what comes to mind?


595c - "what is imitation?"
// Imitativeness is a problem with the form of the art, not the content of the art.

Structural functional
Vervaeke's word for that is Transjective - spans between subject and object.

596b - introduction of the idea of forms, or idea ("idas"). Instances can be many. Idea of bed. Instances are many.
(597 - says the idea of the bed is the essence of the bed).

596c - 
Person #1) "One who is the maker of all the works of all other workmen."
"What an extraordinary man!".
"For this is he who is able to make not only vessels of every kind, but plants and animals, himself and all other thingsâ€”the earth and heaven, and the things which are in heaven or under the earth; he makes the gods also."
"He must be a wizard and no mistake".
gods small g - 


596e - I can do that by spinning a mirror around in a circle ... but those would be appearances.

The painter creates a depiction of a bed, which is true in one sense, but untrue in another sense (in the way that creating appearances in a mirror is untrue).

597e - And the tragic poet is an imitator, and therefore, like all other imitators, he is thrice removed from the king and from the truth?

2 beds, then the third bed ... no perfect bed.
.... why is that painting worth millions of $?
Artists contend with the unknown.


"Correlation doesn't equal causation" is like the one thing that someone learned from a statistics class. Most of the time when someone says that to me, they aren't actually trying to get at the essence.
Part of that is due to the form of the conversation. Conversations have a point.
It can be used skeptically. Which is like the fallacy of identifying against. It's better to make a point than to shoot down a point. There's a place to be defensive in argument and say that. I'm just saying that the skeptical application of that phrase is usually the application of the midwit.


598D -
Plato's making fun of the one who's able to analyze the nature of knowledge and have superior knowledge of every art. That's smarty pants.
The content of the poetry is not where the meaning is. The content of the poetry is not. What is it's essence. It does not the important part of it. The point is not to describe in propositional terms what the poets is trying to convey.

"The poets who give you virtue as well as vice, and divine things..."
Last week we talked about movement and the dialectical nature of things.

You can't justify justice to unjust people. They will kill you before you do that.
If you don't have the life experience to understand the intrinsic pleasure of the higher parts, then you don't get it.
If you have to ask the question then you don't get it. Only the unjust person asks the question.

600 - 
Did Homer actually achieve success in waging? A real war? No, he didn't. He's just talking about it.

Ask Homer which battle he won - what does he know about courage? Sophacles was a general. Plato is cherry picking, and you're supposed to know that. There were lots of poets that were generals.

600c - But it's the virtue that's the target and the popularity.

Art is a necessity because it gives us the reason to exist.

A painting can be more real than a photograph because it can show things that a photograph can't show.
I'm a big fan of making my environment beautiful and organized.
Part of that is establishing a relationship with the ideas that the images represent.
I like having images of resilience in my office.

Poets & music can put color on things.

601 D - 
User > Maker > Immitator
Excellence or beauty of a thing is relative to its intended use.
E - the flute player has authority on the goodness or badness of a flute. Flute maker has confidence in the flute player.

E - 
"Will he know from use whether or no his drawing is correct or beautiful?"
Kai Greene
> The fist - propaganda
> 	The fist is a part of the story.

The imitative guy.
He wants to be the theme of the work because it has more honor and profit. He doesn't actually want to produce works.

602c - "And what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed?"
You can't have the rational part unsustained.

Everything you know starts with senses. Decartes - I think therefore I am. I'm a skeptic. Oh wait a minute, there has to be an I for me to be skeptical. Kind of an obvious observation. One that was made prevalently 2000 years BC in the Vedic traditions, by the way.


D - confusion ??
deceiving by light and shadow
Christ says I am the light of the world. Satan is the angel of light, too. They're competing for dominion.


602E - The problem with calculation & rationality is you need narrative to do relevance realization.
That produces a question. If you assume things aren't the same, why?
Soul summons calculation & intelligence to separate between 1 & 2.
Dividing is a separation - a calculated decision to separate.


You don't do narrative with rationality. It's supra rational.
603 - the rational part trusts measure & calculation, but what does the measure & calculation trust?
"Do you believe what science tells you?"
Science allows me to make fire; my body tells me I need a fire.


"Body is implicitly contextualizing".
You relate from the body - it's the preexisting context you were born into. From that you contextualize everything else (a la piaget & those guys).


The embodiment informs the categorization of the world in order to achieve things.


Passions are the most important - 
Tempered & moderated
