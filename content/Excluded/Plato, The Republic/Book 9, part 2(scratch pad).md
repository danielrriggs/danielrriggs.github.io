Expanding awareness empathically or empathetically. It's like a hallucination. Taking on another perspective in the body.

Madness stems from desire > action.
A mad person must be delusional. That's why the re-defining of terms like George Orwell's thought police.
A mad person must get to a delusional place. By definition they're going to think what's right is wrong. Their conscience has been imprinted or stamped or molded a certain way. Moving the rated R line feeling. When you're in the presence of evil. 
Comment on broadway.
The feeling in your body when you violate your conscience. Taste in your mouth. Hair stands up. Chills. For me, sometimes dark parts of a good drama. Like watching Sweeny Todd.
Feeling affects sight.

Mark - nature of slavery.

King & Tyrant.
	Happifies - qualified by necessary hapiness.
	Tyrant - minimum virtue if we take justice to be place in the hierarchy.
	Evil is  - 42 units unjust by 42 units unhappy.

8 - 5 types of govt.

Tyrant is not a single person. The philosopher king under the current way of thinking - would be a philosopher tyrant. in 9 - king is the right answer.
These are the 5 things.


They're willing subjects to what's going to happen to them by talking to Socrates. They're exemplifying the philosopher king because he's the philosopher king.
They're living in a post Pythagorean world. Pythagorean cult?



Ted talks
to ???
To multi person talk.
Moving away from experts convincing you that what they think is correct.
We're now more collective, more dialogical. Multi perspective.

The reverse - reenchanting the world. Peterson working through something Live. Then he moves to the dialogical (Ex: Exodus).
The University no longer has a stranglehold over who does it & how it gets done.
The project of veritas left the university 
Age of Gnosis - opens an opportunity.
Tweet irony - use the age of Gnosis to grab the people who I'm talking about. Ultimate subversion.
The momentum is towards.
Pattern: experts > people think in real time > distributed cognition.

Vervaeke - ask questions. Rank them by frequency. Respond to the top 10. Powerful mode of engagement.
If you could do that at the same time on YouTube, that's powerful. So, what you see is the live audience engagement. Live stream - alot of work; a pain.


Levels - winner take all incentive vs. catering to the average player, let's say.
Malcolm Gladwell - sports participation structure in HS for track & field heavily values the eliete.


"Legalize drugs" - subversive framing.
Decriminalization.
Psychology - repeated habits. If you think something is bad, but you actually do it, then do you really think it's bad?

Instantly go to the top 20% usually 20% of local competition.
Delusional truth - gun culture; embodied
Caffeine consumption limits my potential. I'm really fast. Fire from holster reliably in under 1s. Sub 800ms. World class level. Never miss 20 times.
Bodybuilding, or weight lifting form - 99% 


Legalism & EMT.
All things are legal unless there's a law against it.
"Legalize drugs".
Drugs are illegal because of law.
They know what they're doing.


Pharasee power trip - cop looking to solve crimes that aren't crimes.
Righteous zealot for some cause.
"Why are your eyes dialated, boy?"


Sin - move back the ultimatum of what's right & wrong. I got a bad feeling about this. Peterson - warning


Shooting | bodybuilding - principles are wrong.
Stretch, squeeze. Not moving from point A to point B.
Exercise can be done to train Mind muscle connection & feeling. Then you can be way more efficient with your energy. 2 or 3 days a week; minimal time. Time to gain the skill to do High Intensity training.
A -> B.


Shooting - like martial arts or tai chi. You have to relax. Draw a straight line from the holster.
Controled that weapon like a lazer. Having used rifles at competetive levels (can't 45 degrees) straight left arm. C cup. Rfiles aren't fired @ 90 degrees. The fastest in the world can't the rifle.
WW2 - field handbooks standing @ 90 degrees shooting a 1911 pistol with one hand.


Don't need to take the guy on the street & elevate him up (Evangelicalism). They're trying to bring the bottom up & bring down the top. Grim says he'll mess stuff up.
Hitler & Stalin - talk to the top class. Get them to believe something. Only have to turn a small number of people. Look @ the rise of Tim Pool & Sargon of Akkad. That's how you do it.


You only need cafes in a few key cities to convince a few key people.


You have to front run the system, not try to convince the people ...


Seeing clearly. Expanding awareness & feeling or hallucinating or madness.
Functions of the mind.
Holding a question in mind.
When you do shadow work, you go into the closet to get the references. You ask the question & hold it there.


Jordan Peterson's sit on the edge of your bed and ask what stupid things am I doing? That meditation never worked for me. I didn't get any answers from that question when I asked it that way.
> Teach people to refine their own questions.
"Problem formulation is the most important thing".
The quality of questions you ask determine the quality of your life.


It can receive certain instructions and it will obey. You can do certain things, and you are certain if that. You see that you can do it and that is something you know. What is it to do it? Directing ones energy does not mean the effect will occur. It isn't guaranteed that my leg will lift. It's just always done that, but conceivably, my leg may not obey me someday. Direction comes from aim. And aim comes from ... Where?

Experience or judgment in software can show to path to harmonious success. A good software leader can plan effectively & get the job done without overtime with quality. Deliver on time & fairly. Sober minded; having good judgment.


Cultivate leaders.


Chose your role.


(Meditation; being present; aescetisim; different forms of yoga; 
ethical quandry. Krishna | Arjuina or something.

Dialogue - 
Platonic - 

Fabric of reality - 
Hierarchy & duty. Negative emotion - I run well on duty. I decide I need to show up at 9am for the book club.
I slept 0 hours last week and this week I slept very little. I decided to allocate a certain amount of time towards an end. Part education | part communion | part exploratory | putting something generative on the calendar.


Power of Command.
Kids respect me. Physical authority.
2 time in my life - yelled - like a force field. I could see that I terrified a crowd. Like none of them could have fought me. Like a spartan holding a choke point. Noone is at this level & nobody is getting through me. You all know that if you try to move me that you will die. And you see in the signature of the yell that it carries the competence. Like it was a real yell. I have access to this real thing & you know it & can see it.
In my car - reminisce about it. Highly comfortable there. I still take naps in my car sometimes. In Arkansas I would


Harmony in position, or, role.
Better do do your role perfectly than someone else's role well.


Incapable of meditation; some can meditate & will go nuts. You can't stop @ meditation. Like stoicism. Better than nihilism; but  you can't stop @ stoicism, because it'll betray you.

Animal Magnetism & science of the day ... idk how he did what he did. Can tell you the principles; that they work. Idk how.
Training ... hypnosis.

Theory of the realm of forms - relies on a magical component that states that either before you're born, or after you're born, you interface with the forms. As an unformed creature. That is reflected. That idea is fractally patterned up the stack. You are imprinted from childhood. Childhood imperfects you. Up from that, rationality either ?? or dooms you. That's why the appeals to the gods. You need something outside yourself. Parents. Education. Your own rationality. Your rationality is dependent on the gods. When all this stuff fails, we rely on the gods for the coin toss.
Philosophers have to be drug down. All against self will. Your self will is insufficient. It won't work. It destroys the world. Middle of book 8. Adopt Democracy. People become a zombie; world flattens out. The city gets destroyed. Individualism.

Need distributed cognition. Meditation isn't the answer. How to enchant better than Peterson or Vervaeke?


Aspect of my behavior - use functionally as a short circuit.
I've decided to believe this because I decided on a role & I need these beliefs to fulfill the role.
Demonic - 


Last step - being in right relationship in the hierarchy.


Submission - Aim or direction. Determines your aims.


Theory of forms - relativism.
Win the lottery - submissions (I don't have enough $); those submissions go away.
Your behavior determines your submission. Can't measure it in relation to yourself.


Rebellion - the only reflection you have is self reflection. Causes the intimacy crisis.
You. Your connection to your body.
Meaning crisis people can't be naturally submitted. No access to church, or the utility to church.
Access - seen in other experiences.

Meaning manifests - soccer winning state championship in a shut out. The entire team had this shared like "wow, this feels really cool." 3 months in the winter of sprints before touching the ball. 5 months of training w/ the ball. Then 4 months of intense game schedule. Being on a campaign. fighting hard with the team.


Distributed cognition has emergent properties. Kicks off signals.
Better to be too busy to meditate.


If you know how you know ...
"The really real ... "


Algorithms - intuition.
Van Halen invented a way of playing guitar out of ignorance. He did it wrong. However, what he did was correct. A new way of playing guitar emerged from his passion of playing guitar.
Putting it into code (embodying the intuition).


Sometimes I start writing on a paper; test case
n + 1.
base case - recursive.
Divide & conquer.
Greedy algorithm.
GoF - "design patterns" | 
Rainbow mountain - 3 hours;
Unpleasant - hold my mind on something painful - go home & leetcode. That's actually harder. I get tired. My brain starts to squirm & I want to stop.


Grind & don't get a FANG job, waste of time.
How good is good enough? Every hour I spend on this stupid studying is
Reframing - mental training. I don't want to do this. I'm happy bumming & living on low cost. What am I doing not.


Literally by going to some yoga classes & talking to people - after class there is a 70% chance of, usually someone goes up to the teacher & says quietly in a hushed voice; this class was really important for -xyz- reasons.


"It's all beatings". Beatings will continue till morale improves. You're a muppet valence. That frame is suited to the audience.


Notice that in a certain state - those opportunities present themselves more. Yoga crew went out to lunch & didn't invite me. I was kind of disappointed.
Put it in the bucket of "survival". Not - goofing with friends. Or, watching a YouTube video - valuetainment to me. Part education, but interesting & fun. Doing work in a state of ease.
College - blind leading the blind - dissonance around where time goes.


It's the external things that give feedback.

Identify for something good. Why you should be in your own business. When your goal is not to do the job of the customer, but to do the job of the business. Will do it fast & efficiently compared to everyone else.
How to monetize your time thats healthy - have someone set the schedule.
Can't manifest what you want to manifest.
Will overwork your 40 hours. Either better off having a hard limit (1 more thing...).


Performance | attached to ideology
OO Theory - nit pick
SOLID

Java - .equals()
Type gymnastics - 


- Go around to people & say - hey, please use the component which I wrote that lives in the shared code library instead of re-inventing the wheel.
- Business APIs - developers writing CRUD endpoints.
	- There's a minimal # of toplolgies - Sql or NoSql -
		- Sql - 1:M ... 1:1 ... 0:1 ... 0:M > Java implications - stateless beans; value objects (immutable); DE | BO ... containers & multithreading ... 

...
Calculation ... king. Bottomless pit. When consuming earthly things, your desire, when pointed at earthly things is never fulfilled. Like a container with holes drilled in the bottom of it.


Book 9 - it's like the
