**Chapter 2 Summary**

- Glaucon puts forth 3 categories of goods:
	- 1) Those desireable for the sake of themselves.
		- Ex: Harmless pleasures / delights
	- 2) Those desireable for their own sake AND for the sake of their results.
		- Ex: Knowledge, sight, and health
	- 3) Those for the sake of their consequences, but are undesireable in themselves
		- Ex: Gymnastics; ways of making money
- Glaucon asks Socrates which category Justice belongs in -
	- Socrates response: It's in the highest category (category #2).
	- Glaucon agrees with Socrates; Glaucon says the majority of people place justince in the lowest category (category #3).
- Glaucon makes 3 arguments
	- 1) Demonstrates the nature & origin of Justince
		- The laws which are agreed upon and ordained are deemed just & lawful.
		- Origin: Experiencing & suffering evil, and an agreement to have neither.
	- 2) Proves that men behave according to justice against their own will
		- If people have the power to behave as they wish, the Just & Unjust person will behave the same (they will pusue the path in accordance with their own self interest and "happiness"). He says that people will only divert to the path of justice by force of laws.
			- Example: Gyges (a shepard). Once day, there's an earthquake. Gyges goes to check it out. He finds a ring from a dead more-than-human figure. He takes it. It makes him invisible. He seduces the queen, kills the king, and seizes the kingdom.
	- 3) Argues that the unjust life is better than the just life
		- Parents teach their kids to be just just for the rewards of being considered just.
		- Appearances tyranizes truth, and is lord of 'happiness'. A just man can be considered unjust, while an unjust man can be considered just, and accordingly, rewarded. Thus, Glaucon concludes that it's better to be unjust and appear just, because a man gains both the rewards of justice & injustice.
		- Furthermore, there is no need to conceal one's injustice from the gods. If the gods care about human interactions, a wealthy unjust man will better be able to appease them with sacrifices to attone for his injustice compared to a poor person.

Socrates Rebutal
- Justice is found in the individual as well as in the State (Wissem brought this point up last week).
- Because the State is larger than the individual, they will more easily discern Justice in the State. Therefore, they will more easily discern justice in the State, then proceed to the individual.
// todo: left off here. argument ventures into book 3.


Glaucon describes that when men have done evil and suffered evil they agree among themselves to have neither.
