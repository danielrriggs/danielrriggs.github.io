	- Motivated by power
	- Relative argument (effectiveness)

What was the cause of the government manifestation?
This kind of government makes this kind of person - causal error? Top down?
Government manifestation isn't causal.

We've been through this sequence so many times. We aren't talking about the governmental manifestation.
I'm not 

I'm not a political consultant, and nobody has ever given me a cookie at a cocktail party or on twitter for my hot political take. So I don't care.
I'm primarily concerned with the nature of the soul.

The form of the argument
- Thrasymacus

He's wrong, it's a flimsy case, throw it away.

Tripartide theory of the soul
Rational, Spirited, Epetitive
Rational - grasps the world of the forms. Should be ultimate arbiter of one's life.
Spirited - Energy to pursue the good things dictated by reason.
Epetitive - seat of bodily desires. When governed by rational & spirited, can live with health & grace.

Desire - necessary & unnecessary. Necessary = grounded in human nature (ex: bread). We can't stop wanting what they aim at.
Unnecessary = not grounded in human nature. Can be eliminated by education & habit. What we acquire w/ this may not be good for us.

Lawful & lawless desires.
Lawless - shamefull. Ex: homo sex, murder,
Lawful - admits no shame.

Son ... father lack of ambition ... woman lack of social status. she's mad the husband is indifferent b/c of her lack of status & lack of honor. "He's too easy going; not manly."
My dad's integrity - rock solid;
	Raise a child up in the way & he won't go away.
		There's an embodied example that I can't betray.

Timocratic - surrendering to the spirited aspect of the soul (the son falls in the middle).
Oligarch - was poor. Wants to make $.
	The rational & spirited are overtaken by the epetetive (enslave reason & spirit to appetite).


Parts of soul; their pleasures & desires.

Drones - reinforce things through habit & repitition.
