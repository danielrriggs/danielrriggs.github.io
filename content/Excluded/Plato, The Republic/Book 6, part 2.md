"are but human"

This Divided Line business

The Character
First Principle
Minds Eye
Soul

Nature Nature Nature; then, educate the nature w/o corrupting it.
The nature of the world - corrupts any seed before it can become a philosopher.

"One whose first principles are to survive in nature".
Don't need practices, just need discernment.
"Can enact practices around discernment." Maybe, but probably can't do by yourself.

How do you know, from the outside, all the stuff you need to protect the seed from?

Image of the philosopher:
"they have seen onlyÂ a conventional imitation of philosophy, consisting of words artificially brought together, not like these of ours having a natural unity. But a human being who in word and work is perfectly molded, as far as he can be, into the proportion and likeness of virtue".


Jumping the is - ought gap?
Don't need to put it in an ontology.
Practices - not needed?


???
You may remember, I said, that we divided the soul into three parts; and distinguished the several natures of justice, temperance, courage, and wisdom?


Missed - captain analogy - stargazing (my translation talked about navigation > celestial). Not ignorant of the right things. ("What do you mean you can't train a new captain?").


Is seeking knowledge the cause of science? (509)
The cause of science isn't inherently truthful or good.
"Science is a drawing out of the incomplete mapping".


What is a hypothesis? 


Knowledge
first principle ??
What comes first?
Pleasure? No
Knowledge? No
Being good?
Knowledge of the Good?


There are many beautiful, many good.
There's an absolute (essence) beauty & good.


similitude of the sun.
Intellectual realm & visible realm
(510) images (shadows, reflections)

Math models the physical (the hypothesis - 511ish).
To rise above hypothesis.

511 B
division of the intelligible
by the power of dialectic, using the hypotheses not as first principles, but only as hypotheses

Rationalism vs empiricism
"We cannot live in a Two World Mythology"


Pattern:
A Telos
Justice (health of mind)
Temperance


Ways people get distracted:
1) Other virtues
2) Luxury

Philosophic nature - you're affected by things others aren't.


Beast | the world | divine 
The eye | 


The corruption of the philosopher makes ?? biggest evil.
Mad scientist archetype.
More capacity = you can do more stuff & be undetected for awhile.
The road to hell is paved with good intentions.

Piece of paper ... practice with tools to retain right relationship w/ the tools.

Person needs ??

What transcends the observable?


Monotheism - 1 && Many
Sophism is polytheism. You can switch allegiances. They're mercenaries (please the people who want their services. They'll adapt to the expectations of who pays them).


Sophists - opinion, reality | realm of opinion (neither T/F. Aimless). The example of dog trainer. Is being in relationship with the dog.
Dog Trainer - disconnected from the ?? of
Attuned to functionality. An ethic based on necessity. This is what utilitarianism is.


Sophos is not Sophia. Refers to an expert of a profession. Sophists refer to experts, or expertise.
Sophists get corrupted because they serve a single master.
Because they don't have the wisdom (or knowledge) of the principles they are embodying.


Problem of today: expertise is no longer serving the purpose.
(Cancer being a genetic problem ... proceeding by expertise). Wisdom tells you when expertise fails.
Sophists get correction based upon praise (based on affirmation they're receiving).

If you base yourself on praise, you'll experience audience capture. Or, worse yet, a small # of people who will encourage your bad behavior. Small # of articulate (can use the Sophist (expert)) people can manipulate ?? ...
Praise people - the people telling you how to steer the ship.


Architecture of Good

Philosopher useless because they can't implement.

"You recognize the truth of what I have been saying?" > He's making an experiential reference. Different style of argument that he didn't make before.


"In the realm of forms ... or the spiritual realm".
Prophets - eyes up. Priests - eyes down.

Tension is that which binds.
Need to have ?? to have the middle ground which we occupy.
... submission

God # 1, God # 2.
Suffering - 

(Ch1 - get worldly things, or get the relationship w/ Truth & then be able to not connect with anybody.) You can't be useful to people around you. This points at the futility of that disagreement. You self-isolate (the philosopher). He goes a separate way. You can't commune.
People ruminating (thinking) on the crises on the world. They're trying to pull themselves out of the world so they can judge it. In doing so, they are unable to commune. It's actually a problem of a philosopher.

Relationships - Peterson says - do the arithmetic on how many times you're going to see someone in the rest of your life. You can frame things to bring urgency to be present. Not a lust for accomplishment. It's more of a decision to be integrated and resist distractions.

Manuel on TLC - ?? levels of validation ??

Levels (Sophism - people trying to be different experts of the same problem).
1) levels of validation
2) Tower of Babel - they're all building the same tower, but their own version. It's not connected

Rulership - include the country in his personal salvation.
Well, we also need the perfect society (the ground).

Gymnastics of the soul - something to (physical feedback)? (don't like suffering).
We can't have the philosophers do work... or get expertise.

Good philosopher must struggle w/ other people & in the gym. It ?? the dialectic. It's being in the dance. It's the cultivation of intimacy.

**Attunement starts physically (exaptation??) & goes up?**
There's the emanation & our relationship to it. Our relationship to it emerges.
	Training & dietary principles - science is way behind. We hardly know anything.

Being more true


// If you present the philosopher king in the right way, people will accept him.
Opportunity to be present; experience sensation; opportunity train concentration. That's what it's all about.
I have heard every good bodybuilder say this (in their own words).
Reverential
"Almost everything about War is good except the death, bloodshed, loss of life".
Eckhardt Tolle's Power of Now - only part of the puzzle.

Whether the philosopher can't help - go either way.


the soul is like the eye
(509) The sun

What are the forms?
Is it the spiritual realm?
Rationalism vs Empiricism - cause of science


The Sun - ability to see through contrast. It also gives you energy and ... and ... and ...


// super high god like perspective - everything can be redeemed. but, on the lower frame, it's still a failure.
Your action didn't match the source (the Sun).
If you end at the failure.
Starts to emmanate ... 

Rationalism - capacity to reason.
Empiricism - my primary mode of understanding is -x-.
Epistemology first. With your reason or with your embodiment. Why's epistemology important.


Ways of informing the world.


Noone would disagree with
- Affordances preexist
- You're limited
- Attunement starts physically & goes up
	- Conversation needs to be embodied. That's where we find actual agreement.

Epistemology
Divided Line
Forms
Philosopher - imitation - level of agreement. They'll be sheep & follow the spirit (the wind). It's a level of agreement, but not a binding level of agreement. Because it's expedient.

- The tool (epistemology) is corrupted.
Mathematics - permanent


Reflected perfection
The affordance for the existence of triangles.
Ethereal realm.

More perfect = more fragile.
Fragility & perfection are related.

You need to be subjected to it. You see it in a dream.
Hallucination

Forms - intelligibility.


Epistemology
Axiology
Ontology


"The Good emanates onto you".
