**Book 1 Summary**
- Introduction to Cephelas, an old rich guy
	- Passions relax in old age. Experience calmness; freedom.
	- Advantages of weath: I don't need to deceive another man; In younger years, fear of punishment in the afterlife was a laughing matter; later in life, it's a more serious issue.
- Cephelas' Justice - **Justice is paying debts & telling the truth**.
	- Refutation: Socrates shows several instances where it isn't Just to repay one's debts.
		- Such as returning guns to a mad friend. Or, if my mad friend asks me where -Dave- is so he may kill Dave.

- (Cephelas' son) Polemarchus' Justice - **Justice is doing good to friends, evil to enemies.**
	- Refutation: The just man never does evil, even to his enemies.
		When something inflicts harm on a horse, the horse deteriorates in the excellence of a horse.
		Similarly, to injure a man is to deteriorate his excellence, which is Justice.
		 A horseman, by his art, cannot injure a horse, nor can a musician by his art, make men un-musical. Similarly, a just man, by justice, cannot make another man unjust. Thus, only unjust men injure other men. To do evil is never just.

- Thrasymachus' Justice - **Justice is to the advantage of the stronger.**
	- Tyrany, democracy, aristocracy - make laws to their own interest. These laws **are** the Justice which they deliver to their citizens. 
		- Violators of the law are unjust. Because government has power to make (& enforce??) the laws, it is the stronger.
	- Refutation:
		- Rulers are not infallable. They pass laws that aren't in their best interest.
		- Some laws encourage citizens to behave contrary to the interest of the stronger. If Justice is merely obeying the laws, it isn't always in the interest of the stronger.
			- Is a mathemetician a mathemitician when he makes a mistake? Or, is he not a mathemeticial at that point in time?
			- Every art has an interest (which is the arts' subject, not the art itself). Medicine, the patient. Horsemanship, the horse. No art is concerned with its own interest, because it has none. No physician considers his own good in his prescriptions, but considers the patient. Thus, the ruler makes laws in the interest in the ruled, not to himself. Therefore, people must be paid to rule, because they're passing laws in the interest of their subjects, not themselves.
				- Each art gives us something good. Medicine good health; navigation safety on the seas; payment, money.
					- We don't confuse the art of navigation with the art of medicine just because one becomes healthy on a sea voyage. Etc. [[Modal confusion]]? (having vs being mode).
				- Societal payments: money, honor, or punishment.
					- Men with less avarice rule by payment of punshment, else less just men then them rule.
	- Thrasymachus: The Unjust man is happier than the Just man. The Just man is miserable, the Unjust happier. Therefore, injustice is more advantageous than justice.
		- Socrates: Justice is wisdom & virtue, while Injustice is ignorance & vice.
			- Mathmetician Analogy: a Mathemetician doesn't desire to be more than a mathemetician (yet wants to become more knowladgeable on Math than a non-mathemetician), so to does the Just man not desire more than the Just, but does desire more than the UnJust. Likewise, the man ignorant of Math desires more than the mathemetician AND the non-mathemeticians. Just as the unjust man desires more than both the Just & UnJust.
		- Because Justince is Wisdon & Virtue, it is stronger than injustice, which is ignorance.

- Socrates: The unjust are incapable of common action. A group of thieves must behave justly if they wish to conspire. If they were truly unjust, they would inflict evil upon one another, & would not be able to work towards a common cause. Injustice renders an individual incapable of action because of internal disorder.
- Everything has an end, and an excellence. The end of the eye, sight; the ear, hearing; the soul, happiness.
	- If the eye's excellence deteriorates, the eye is incapable of achieving its particular end.
	- If the soul's excellence deteriorates, it won't be capable of achieving its' end, happiness.
- At the end of Book 1, Socrates says that we don't yet have a good description of Justice, but have only identified a few superficial attributes & consequences of behaving Justly.


**Book 2 Summary**

- Glaucon puts forth 3 categories of goods:
	- 1) Those desireable for the sake of themselves.
		- Ex: Harmless pleasures / delights
	- 2) Those desireable for their own sake AND for the sake of their results.
		- Ex: Knowledge, sight, and health
	- 3) Those for the sake of their consequences, but are undesireable in themselves
		- Ex: Gymnastics; ways of making money
- Glaucon asks Socrates which category Justice belongs in -
	- Socrates response: It's in the highest category (category #2).
	- Glaucon agrees with Socrates; Glaucon says the majority of people place justince in the lowest category (category #3).
- Glaucon makes 3 arguments
	- 1) Demonstrates the nature & origin of Justince
		- The laws which are agreed upon and ordained are deemed just & lawful.
		- Origin: Experiencing & suffering evil, and an agreement to have neither.
	- 2) Proves that men behave according to justice against their own will
		- If people have the power to behave as they wish, the Just & Unjust person will behave the same (they will pusue the path in accordance with their own self interest and "happiness"). He says that people will only divert to the path of justice by force of laws.
			- Example: Gyges (a shepard). Once day, there's an earthquake. Gyges goes to check it out. He finds a ring from a dead more-than-human figure. He takes it. It makes him invisible. He seduces the queen, kills the king, and seizes the kingdom.
	- 3) Argues that the unjust life is better than the just life
		- Parents teach their kids to be just just for the rewards of being considered just.
		- Appearances tyranizes truth, and is lord of 'happiness'. A just man can be considered unjust, while an unjust man can be considered just, and accordingly, rewarded. Thus, Glaucon concludes that it's better to be unjust and appear just, because a man gains both the rewards of justice & injustice.
		- Furthermore, there is no need to conceal one's injustice from the gods. If the gods care about human interactions, a wealthy unjust man will better be able to appease them with sacrifices to attone for his injustice compared to a poor person.

Socrates Rebutal
- Justice is found in the individual as well as in the State (Wissem brought this point up last week).
- Because the State is larger than the individual, they will more easily discern Justice in the State. Therefore, they will more easily discern justice in the State, then proceed to the individual.
