Virtues ... which are also four in number?
1) Wisdom - good council. Needs knowledge, but not the kind of knowledge that makes a good carpenter.
	1) // A city can have an "agricultural" knowledge (& therefore, reputation)
	2) Wisdom is the knowledge of the perfect guardian.
		1) Guardians - the smallest class.
		2) Knowledge which resides in this presiding and ruling part of itself
		3) has been ordained by nature to be of all classes the least

2) Courage
	1) When you think of **courage** - people will think about the fight.
- The relationship to action or (impact?). The other classes can be courageous or cowardly, but, will that make a difference?

	- "Of the opinion respecting **things to be feared**, what they are and of what nature, which the law implants through education; and I mean by the words ''**under all circumstances**'' to intimate that in **pleasure** or in **pain**, or under the influence of **desire** or **fear**, a man preserves, and does not lose this opinion. Shall I give you an illustration?"

If you're going to dye something purple, you gotta start with pure white, else it won't produce a good purple.

The guardians were educated with music & gymnastics so that they would take the dye of the laws in perfection. Like a solvent.
Conformity to law.
The beast or slave's **uninstructed** courage is not ordained by the law.

2) Temperance

	2) is the ordering or controlling of certain pleasures and desires
Self mastery is a silly concept because the master is also the servant.
- There are better & worse principles. When the better is under control, we call that master of self. Otherwise, we call it unprincipled.
- the State, ... may be justly called master of itself, if the words "temperance" and "self-mastery" truly express the rule of the better part over the worse.
- Temperance is like a harmony
	- Courage & wisdom reside in a part of the state (courage making it valiant, and wisdom making it wise).
	- Temperance extends to the whole and runs through all the notes of the scale.
	- Agreement of the superior and inferior?
