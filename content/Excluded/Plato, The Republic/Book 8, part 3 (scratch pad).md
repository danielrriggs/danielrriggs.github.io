Container of job

554 B - 
"had he been educated he would never have made a blind god director of his chorus, or given him chief honour"
"The meiserly guy isn't a man of cultivation (connotation that cultivation is proactive)"
Why no redemption themes?
Lost & then gets educated

- coerces his badÂ passions by an enforced virtue
- not making them see that they are wrong, or taming them by reason, but by necessity and fear constraining them, and because he trembles for his possessions.

The meiser is split, but the superior.

554 E - 
"For these reasons such an one will be more respectable than most people; yet the true virtue of a unanimous and harmonious soul will flee far away and never come near him."

Democracy starts @ 555 B

Contracts @ own risk
governors - life of luxury & idleness (556 B). of body & mind. incompetent. can't resist pain or pleasure.
Indifferent to cultivation of virtue.
The poor fight next to the wealthy (out of shape); say they aren't good for anything ... later in tyranny authority & institutions lose their respect. The youth don't respect their elders.
It seems like Democracy's the best
557 E - there's no necessity (to be @ peace or go to war).
Like Brave new World - the problem of pleasure. 558 - nobody cares about heroes.
Hakunamatatta - "forgiving spirit" (558 B).
