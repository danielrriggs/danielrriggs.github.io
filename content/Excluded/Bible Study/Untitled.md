Crown... Give back

Revelations 5

Paul mentions faith and prayer slot


Busy ... Extra time in prayer

Grow in faith ... By learning ... Sanctification 
Holy man vs sinless man (holy cast??)

Concept of becoming like what you worship

2nd coming of Christ.... Epiphany. (Appearing of Jesus). ). Apocalypse (Revelation) & return). 3rd perusia: to be or to be present. The coming of the Lord: the Perusia.
The Lord's return: his presence.
Unbelievers: apocalypse take by surprise shock & awe bad day. For believers, the presence of Jesus.

Imminence of the return of Christ. Opposite of escapist... Stay busy growing in love. 

New American Standard
New King James??
