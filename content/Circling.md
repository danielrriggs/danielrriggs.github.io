Circling is often described as a practice of intersubjective or interpersonal meditation.

The Circling Method was created by Guy Sengstock. He describes circling as a:

multi-stage relational practice and unique transformational modality. It is a dynamic group process that is part-art-form, part-skillful facilitation and part-relational yoga. It is also a unique modality that can be practiced one-on-one. Although it is based on complex ideas, participating in it can be easy and fun for people at all levels of experience.

There are three major “lineage schools” of Circling: The Circling Institute, Circling Europe, and the Integral Life Institute.
