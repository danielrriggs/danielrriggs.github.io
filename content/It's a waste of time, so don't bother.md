The belief that "I can't afford to do this unless it's going to work". Being too concerned with making that wrong choice that you make no choice at all. If we've wasted some amount of time, our mind creates this [[Samskara]] which tells us that we have very little left to waste. The more time that we've actually misused, the more paralyzed we are, the more miserly we become with the time that's left. The more mistakes that we make, the more we hang on to what we have left. The more behind we actually fall, the more careful we are about how we spend our time.

 The big irony here is once this [[Samskara]] takes over our mind and says, we can't afford to make mistakes anymore, I have to know that this time investment is going to work 100%. It actually has the opposite effect. It makes it very hard for us to actually try to move forward. We become very miserly with the time that we have left.

Why is this? This has something to do with the way that our mind formulates spending time or spending money.
Our mind misattributes the costs in its [[Action Success Calculation]]. When it thinks, "what do I want to do today?," it includes the wasted time/money from the past which paralyzes us because those high costs are so aversive. Our holding on to the past dooms our future.

How do we overcome this?
- First, like all [[Samskara]]s, notice your thoughts & notice that it's coming from the [[Samskara]].
- Second, mourn the past. No perfect action you can take today will get you any of the time back. It's gone.
- Third, forget about the past & start living in the present.
