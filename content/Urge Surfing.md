A [[Yoga|yogic]] / meditative concept that entered into psychiatry. The idea that we have urges to engage in things, but those urges are fundamentally temporary. The [[Mind]] wants things, but it doesn't want things constantly. It wants to move on to a different [[Desire]].

Urge surfing isn't the kind of meditation that you do (verb), where we sit down, close our eyes, and meditate. Urge surfing is a different kind of meditation practice that requires us to have some urge to begin with. A lot of meditation isn't about sitting down and "meditating".  The purpose of [[Meditation]] is to help us understand ourselves, how we work, and even the nature of the world around us.

In Urge Surfing, we'll begin to understand the nature of the behaviors that control us, and how we shape our desires and cravings over time.

*Example: when a kid throws a temper tantrum & the parent eventually relents, what behavior is the parent reinforcing? The parent is reinforcing the behavior of throwing a temper tantrum. The parent is training the kid to throw temper tantrums.*

When cravings onset, we resist them; as time passes, we resist more and more and the craving gets stronger, until eventually we crack and give in. What is the part of our brain (see [[Neuroscience of Motivation]]) that *wants* the substance / behavior, learning about how to manipulate your behavior (shaping what you do)?
	*If we have a physiologic dependence, like in the case of [[Alcoholism]], our neurons can crave alcohol. Sudden withdrawal from alcohol can be fatal. It can create seizures in the brain and arrhythmia in the heart. As the brain gets closer to having a seizure form alcohol withdrawal, the cravings intensify to the point where, in the brain of an alcoholic, getting alcohol is a matter of life and death. It's no longer like an addiction; it's like a person who's extremely thirsty craving water, or a starving person craving food.*
Something subtle happens which we aren't really aware of. **By waiting for the desire for something to rise, we reinforce the craving.** This is what's confusing for people who are struggling to modify some behaviors or get off of a substance. By resisting, they're actually reinforcing the brain's cravings.

Instead of resisting the urge, we're going to "surf above the urge" without giving into it.
The nature of emotions and the nature of the [[Mind]] is to fluctuate. Emotions don't last. This is true of both negative and positive emotions. This is why boredom is so crippling. If you don't give the mind some way to fluctuate, it starts to get a little bit crazy.

We don't have to "win" against an urge. All we have to do is [[Procrastination|procrastinate]]. All we have to do is delay. Cravings & desires are like waves. We want to "ride the wave".

This is the technique: the next time a craving arises, we want to **watch it**. Don't try to resist it. Give it your full attention and watch it. For each minute that goes by, does it grow or does it shrink? With each hour that goes by, does it grow or does it shrink? We want to watch the whole duration of it. As we watch it grow and grow, we will eventually start to see that it will shrink and shrink.

When we feel an urge, we we think "I can't resist this for forever". But, you don't need to resist it for forever. You just need to resist it for this moment.

If you can do it once, you're training the brain cravings won't get it what it wants, so there's no use in producing them. Once your brain learns that cravings don't control you, the cravings will naturally subside.
