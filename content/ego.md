Ahamkara. Ego. Identity.

Our sense of identity. Ahamkara gets translated as "the feeling of 'I'", or, "the 'I' feeling".
	*When we think about ourselves, we think about certain characteristics (race, age, profession, gender, etc.)*

The Ahamkara is responsible for the **thoughts** & **beliefs** we have of ourselves (which shape our **actions**).

It also shapes our **perceptions**. The way we interpret the outside world gets **filtered** through our sense of Ahamkara.

**All of our thoughts, actions, beliefs, and perceptions are filtered through the ahamkara.**

Ego comes from **without** (a sense of value that's derived externally).

Ego comes from **success**.

One of the key things the ego does is compare. A comparison isn't an emotion; comparisons require an identity to make.

The ahamkara is the **protector** of the mind. When negative emotions arise, it pumps us up & puts others down.

[[Example - how intelligence leads to avoidance]]
	In this example, we see that preserving the identity of being a gifted kid comes at the cost of every other aspect of this person's life.

Ahamkara is also where [[resistance]] comes from.

[[There is a war between the ahamkara and our buddhi]].

When we have a thought in our mind, we believe it's true. That it is fact.
	*If you ask a doctor, "Are you a good doctor?," they'll say "yes" & believe it to be true. They will operate their life around this thought.*
Identity attributes aren't facts. Identities are just perceptions we have about ourselves.
	*This person was a themselves before they were a doctor, and they will be themselves after they are a doctor.*

Our ahamkara tries to preserve our identities; sometimes, at all costs. A lot of the motivational issues & [[resistance]] we encounter when we try to take an action comes from the ahamkara; this resistance manifests in 2 major ways, which are both types of avoidance:
	*If you're **avoiding** something in life and you **really** can't figure out why (you've analyzed everything you can, you've talked to people, & still can't figure it out), then there's a decent chance it's an ahamkara.*
The ahamkara avoids for 2 reasons:
1) To preserve our sense of identity
2) To prevent the formation of another identity

###### Reason 1 - The preservation of identity - Examples:
Example 1 - (referenced above) - to preserve the identity of being a gifted kid, this person avoids / pulls back from other dimensions of life.
Example 2 - a lonely widow avoids dating to preserve the identity of being a widow; as long as she's single, she has an excuse to be a widow. But if she experiences failure in the dating world, now she's single because she's undesirable / a loser, etc.

In order to preserve a part of our identity, we'll never take an action that could threaten it.

###### Reason 2 - Avoiding something we're afraid of becoming
If the widow in example 2 above is afraid of "becoming ugly", she won't enter the dating scene for *fear* of that being proved true.
	So, we get trapped in limbo. We never actually take action that can *confirm* whether our fears are really true (or false). We never put things to the test.

The thing that can disprove our fears is the thing that the ahamkara prevents us from doing.

The [[confirmation bias]] of ahamkara can shape our information. People will misinterpret information based on their sense of identity to confirm what they already believe.

See [[ego work]].
