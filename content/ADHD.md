  - Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
---
The two core features that constitute ADHD are **disorder of attention** and **impulsivity**. These features look different in children & adults.

[[ADHD]] is a very over diagnosed & underdiagnosed condition.
- *Some people complain of problems like [[Depression]] when they actually have [[ADHD]] & have problems in their life due to impaired attention.*
- *Some people think they have [[ADHD]] but their problems are due to things like poor sleep, consuming too many stimulants, and spending too much time on the internet.*
- 5% of kids are diagnosed with [[ADHD]], and about 2.5% of adults are diagnosed with [[ADHD]].

Society as a whole feels like their attention is getting more and more disordered. Why? We aren't entirely sure, but we do notice some things:
- *Technology Use - notifications; bright screens; alluring colors; shorter form content (blogs & long videos to tweets & reels).*
- *Diet - correlations with, omega 3 to omega 6 ratios in our diet and the rise of [[ADHD]]. There are some studies that suggest that processed foods and even color additives can make [[ADHD]] worse. There are even some studies that show that the carbohydrate to protein ratio in your diet may be affecting your level of [[ADHD]].*

The rate of diagnosis is increasing. People feel like they're struggling with their attention more. We're seeing an increase in interest in [[Mindfulness]]. Why?
- *It seems that something about our [[Mind]], ability to focus, and ability to stay motivated is changing.*

- how to prioritize,
- how to deal with procrastination,
- how to manage your emotions better,
- how to find motivation,
- how to meditate

###### Disordered Attention
If there's one central concept that governs ADHD, it is disordered attention. Clinical studies about ADHD show that it's not just the inability to keep your focus on one thing. It's also paradoxically [[Hyperfocus]]. People who have ADHD are unable to let go of a particular activity and focus on what they need to. So ADHD is paradoxically hyper-focus when you don't want to, as well as being unable to focus when you want to.

###### Impulsivity
In children, impulsivity manifests as hyper activity. The original diagnostic research on ADHD was done in children, we didn't appreciate until recently that impulsivity looks different in adults. Clinicians were looking for hyperactivity. But impulsivity in adults looks different (for example, your ability to sit still in a chair as an adult is improved).
- *Some people think they're bipolar because they describe wildly swings and other impulsive behavior, but this isn't bipolar disorder; this is actually adult [[ADD]].*

Adults who struggle with ADHD have a lot of problems that make them feel like incompetent adults.
- *They're forgetful, messy, can't organize things, don't know how to prioritize, get very overwhelmed by choice (another trend in our society - more choice availability).*
- *As we get bombarded with choice, people with ADHD are more vulnerable to distraction, especially adults, and they become more paralyzed with their ability to act.*

#### Clinical Criteria of ADHD
###### Diagnosis is by evaluation, not necessarily testing
A clinical diagnosis means you don't necessarily need to take a test or something like that. Clinicians will ask historical questions about function in school, home, work. Sometimes asking questions is sufficient to make a diagnosis. Some professionals who will use psychometrics (neuropsychological testing) - a series of tests and depending on your ability to keep focus, stay on track or things.

Lots of people have the things that the clinicians look for (disorganized, being unable to focus, getting sidetracked, losing objects, being impulsive), but the key thing they look for is impairment of function.
- Impairment of function is the difference between where is the line is drawn between being sad & clinical depression.
Impairment of function - if you're unable to do significant things in life because of your ability to get distracted easily or inability to stay organized.

###### Diagnostic Criteria
There are two categories, attention and impulsivity. For each of these categories, we want at least six of these criteria for a period of time longer than six months. Years of persistent symptoms is preferable for a diagnosis.

###### Symptoms of Inattention
- Carelessness
- Difficulty Maintaining Attention
- Difficulty Listening - their mind is so [[Hyperfocus]]ed on one thing, their brain drowns out other kinds of stimuli.
- Easily Sidetracked
- Disorganization
- Misplace Belongings
- Forgetfulness - they don't have memory problems; the information never sinks in.
	- Someone might say "I forget where I put my keys a lot" - people with ADHD aren't attending to where they put their keys; they don't have recall problems; the information never gets put in their brain because they were paying attention to something else.
- Easily Distractible - different from sidetracked in that, distractibility is related to the core attentional component
- Avoidance of Intensive Tasks - the diagnosis of ADHD also includes some adaptations (avoiding tasks that require sustained attention)

Adults are more commonly diagnosed with [[ADD]], without the hyperactivity component.
###### Symptoms of Hyperactivity & Impulsivity - these criteria are kind of pediatric in nature
- Excessive Fidgetiness
- Difficulty staying in your seat
- Restlessness of Inappropriate Running
- Hard to Keep Up with / Always on the Go
- Excessive Talking
	- Adults with ADHD will also talk excessively which gets mistaken for things like autism (where they don't realize that no one's paying attention; oblivious to signals from the outside world).
- Blurting out Answers Too Quickly
- Difficulty Waiting
- Interrupting

The criteria of impulsivity and hyperactivity may seem kind of redundant, but part of the reason that we sort of have a lot of these different categories is because each person with ADHD may have a slightly different manifestation.

These symptoms need to be present in more than one situation.
- *For example, if a kid doesn't listen at home, but behaves at school, the problem could be because that the parent isn't setting & enforcing boundaries.*

It's important for a clinician to make this diagnosis because in medicine there's differential diagnosis. You can check all of the criteria for ADHD, but these symptoms could be caused by another disorder, like bipolar disorder with mania. If you give someone like that a stimulant medication, it will make their problems worse. A clinical diagnosis needs to rule out other causes of these symptoms, like substance use, [[Depression]], [[Anxiety]] which can also cause these symptoms.

###### Neuroscience of ADHD
ADHD is a constellation of symptoms, so you won't have every symptom in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] for ADHD. It's important to understand what particular vulnerabilities that a patient with ADHD to develop a tailored plan to combat their ADHD & restore some of their function.

People with ADHD's [[Amygdala]] and [[Insula]] tend to be smaller in volume. Oftentimes in the brain, tissue inhibits stuff. Having less tissue volume in these areas correlates with more emotional responsiveness in ADHD (which is why their emotions get the better & they become impulsive).

People with ADHD's [[Amygdala]] & [[Insula]] have a stronger effect on the [[Nucleus accumbens]] (where we get a sense of reward) than the average brain. This means the behaviors they engage in are more sensitive to **emotions**. This is where some of the **impulsivity** comes from.
- What makes a behavior impulsive? You don't think about it ahead of time; you suddenly engage in it. That sudden engagement can oftentimes be due to an emotion. A neurotypical person's emotions don't immediately translate into behavior. A person with ADHD's emotions are more likely to suddenly create a behavior.

[[Central Nervous System|CNS]] depressants like alcohol slow down thinking & caffeine speeds up thinking. If ADHD is rapid thinking, why does a stimulant medication slow down thoughts? Stimulant medications stimulate the [[Frontal cortex]] which strengthens our ability to control the rest of our brain. The [[Prefrontal Cortex|PFC]] are the brakes of our brain. Stimulant medications strengthen their signal.

[[Orbitofrontal cortex]] - regulates emotions.

[[Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]]

People with ADHD have a weaker [[Anterior cingulate cortex|ACC]]. This is the connection between emotions and emotional circuitry. A neurotypical brain is more able to restrain their emotions. That connection is weaker in people with ADHD.

If we look at what people with ADHD struggle with, they map to different areas of the brain.
- Disorganization - [[Frontal lobes|Frontal lobe]] problem.
- Regulating emotions - could be a weakness of the [[Anterior cingulate cortex|ACC]], or the [[Amygdala]] & [[Insula]] being smaller.
This is where we can get more nuanced with behavior of ADHD. Impulsivity doesn't map to one area of the brain, but we can understand impulsivity in the brain by looking at the influence of other kinds of connections.
