One of the most devastating aspects of [[ADHD]] is how vulnerable your brain is to fun. We usually think of [[ADHD]] and impairments, 

An [[ADHD]] brain has altered circuits which makes the it more vulnerable to the mechanisms of [[addiction]].
- Altered reinforcement circuitry. Pleasurable activities can be more rewarding.
- Impaired Cost Analysis. Due to difficulty delaying gratification, it's easier for someone with [[ADHD]] to no see the cost of engaging in a behavior and only see its' benefit.
- Emotional Dysregulation
	- Our [[Amygdala]] & [[Limbic system]] produce negative emotion. Our [[Frontal lobes|Frontal lobe]] kick in to turn them down / off. The [[ADHD]] brain has a weaker connection between the [[Frontal lobes|Frontal lobe]] & [[Amygdala]] / [[Limbic system]] (making the [[ADHD]] brain worse at regulating negative emotions). There are even some hypotheses that there's a subtype of [[ADD]] that actually is specifically emotional dysregulation.

How's a neurotypical person resist [[Addiction]]s?
- Appreciate the cost of engaging with a substance / behavior.
	- *Example: Drinking this weekend will be kind of fun but the neurotypical brain (Non-"altered reinforcement circuitry"), but it's not like the best time in the universe.*
- We know that addictions are a method of self-medication
All of the features that the neurotypical brain uses to protect itself against [[Addiction]] are busted with the [[ADHD]] brain (for example, if you can't rely on your [[Frontal lobes]] to calm down, you're more likely to reach for substances).

The [[ADHD]] brain is [[Dopamine]] deficient in some areas, like the [[Nucleus accumbens]] (where our [[Dopamine]] [[Reward Circuitry]] is). Substances of abuse (alcohol, THC, technology, stimulants) raise dopamine. Over time with drugs, you develop [[Tolerance]], which will tank [[Dopamine]].

When you grow up with [[ADHD]], you're prone to a lot of shame (& social problems). This is a risk factor for [[Depression]] in adulthood. What does that have to do with [[Addiction]]? Well what do we use substances for? We use substances to drown the shame. As we heal the shame, we fix the self-medication problem.

###### Interventions
- [[Meditation]] - this strengthens our [[Frontal lobes]]' ability to
	- Regulate emotion
	- Control Impulses
- Get better at appreciating costs
	- The [[ADHD]] brain's [[Reward Circuitry]] is altered; as we do things like [[Meditation]] or [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|CBT]], our [[Mind]] slows down is better able to integrate costs & benefits together.

[[ADHD]] & [[Addiction]] seem synergistic effects on each other. In clinical experience, targeting one almost always helps with the other.
