A lot of our motivation heavily influenced by our environment. The concept of [[Permissive]] influences also applies to motivation. It's one of the most underappreciated aspects of motivation. There are certain circumstances in which our motivation can shine forth, and others in which it's restricted. 

Think of permissivity as something that makes it easier to do something else.

#### Social Permissive Influences
###### Friends
We can like our friends, but when you spend time with them, do they move you in the right direction? What effect do they have on your motivation to become the kind of person you want to be? A lot of times our friends, even though we love them & enjoy spending time with them, don't support us in growing into who we want to be. Paradoxically, they keep us stuck; continuing to engage in the same sorts of things. They may be relatively content in life. We need to be careful about what kinds of thoughts and feelings they evoke in us. There may be people who you don't enjoy spending time with, but actually activate the right kind of circuits in your [[Mind]] to make you more motivated.
###### Family
Depending on your culture and family dynamics, family can actually hold you back. Instead of encouraging you to move in the right direction, or become your best self, they will encourage you to follow their path, or do what they want you to do. Or in the worst case scenarios, can be toxic & can deplete your motivating through burdening you with tasks or even sabotaging your efforts.
	*Example: If you grew up in a family that didn't eat healthy, then you try eating healthier, they might feel judged by your food choices & can lash out & sabotage the attempts that you're making to eat healthier.*
###### Romantic Relationships
Some people can put their goals on hold when they enter into a relationship. Then, when they get out of it, they "re-discover" who they are & start moving in a different direction.

Think critically about what spending time with different people cultivates in your motivation. There may be people in your life that you don't share many interests with or don't activate the right circuits in your [[Mind]] to make you more motivated.

*How much time do you spend with them?*
*How are your motivations affected by each of these social interactions?*
*What kinds of motivation are cultivated in these relationships?*
*Do you feel inspired or motivated after spending time with them?*
*What is it like interacting with them?*
*How do you feel after spending time with them?*
*Are they supportive / not supportive of your goals?*

#### Temporal Influences
There may be times of the day, or days of the week, or ever certain seasons that will cultivate the right kind of attitude to help them move forward.

Some people are early risers & are very productive in the morning.
Our [[Circadian rhythm]] effects our ability to concentrate & be productive. Generally speaking, mammals are most active at dawn & dusk & most sluggish at mid day (when it's hottest), but there's lots of individual variability. See [[Studying]] for more.

*When has it been the easiest to work on your goals?*
*When has motivation come easily for you?*
*When is it difficult to work on your goals?*
*When is it hard to find motivation to do things?*
*Are there specific times of the day, days of the week, or months of the year that takes*
*more/less effort to do things?*

#### Environmental Influences
Environment can anchor behavior & is very influential in facilitating the right state of mind. Some people have different spaces for working vs leisure. Some people go to churches / ashrams for meditation. etc.

*Where do you get the best work done?*
*What details about the surrounding are influential in maintaining your focus?*
*Think about a time when you found it hard to focus.*
*Where were you?*
*What environmental factors distract your focus?*
*How can you shape your surroundings to help your motivation?*

#### Cognitive Influences
*Example: A doctor finds that he can only write in the morning. He can work 24 hour days & see patients at any time of the day, now matter how tired he is, there's something about being with another person that allows him to engage in deep work. And, no matter whether he sees 1 person that day or 4 people that day, he is equally exhausted afterward, and finds that he is unable to write. He also finds that when he is on call, there is something about that that keeps him stimulated & finds himself unable to do creative work during that period as well.*

*What activities stimulate your cognition in a positive way?*
*What daily actions help activate vour motivation?*
*What activities do you engage in that make it easy to procrastinate and loose your focus?*


Permissive influences facilitate negative cognitive things as well, like [[Procrastination]]. Like there are some people who inspire us to create, work, and act, there are some people & influences who will work to sabotage our efforts.
	*Example: if you hang out with a group of friends who like to get high, you're going to get high, and if you get high, that will negatively impact your [[productivity]]*
